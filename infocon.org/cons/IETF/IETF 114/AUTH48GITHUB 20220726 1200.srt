so welcome to this uh session uh to

24
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
discuss

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,440
using github or

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,280
some technology

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
for

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,720
doing collaborative authoring or diffs

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,560
or issue tracking

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,120
during auth 48

31
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,040
uh i've

32
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,640
set up the the agenda so people could

33
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,040
provide comments and suggestions for

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
topics to talk about

35
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,800
so

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
let me

37
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,360
move through the slides here

38
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
i've included the note well because this

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,280
is a site meeting of the ietf

40
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,159
this

41
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,319
talks about how you purchase how we

42
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,440
participate in uh these sessions

43
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,720
um

44
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,359
okay you should have seen this already

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,519
all right so the agenda covered the note

46
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
well i'd like to do some agenda bashing

47
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,360
so

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,120
um the overview of the the topics that

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
we wanted to go over

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,159
uh

51
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,599
some

52
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,159
a brief description of our editing

53
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,439
process

54
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,720
uh previous experiments that the rpc has

55
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,959
run

56
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,519
and then the ideas that were

57
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,120
put on the

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
agenda

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,840
so uh we've got

60
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,440
oh i see somebody's joined uh the queue

61
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,120
martin

62
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
yeah gene i i think it might be worth

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,759
talking a little bit also about what the

64
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,759
requirements might be

65
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,840
yes there may be what it is that authors

66
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,479
might appreciate having from the process

67
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,800
yes that is the what benefits and

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,080
features are we seeking is both authors

69
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,440
and editors

70
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,360
uh and then

71
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,919
talking about the technology and we've

72
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,360
said github do we really need github

73
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,320
um

74
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,000
talking about where the source files

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,240
live who's controlling them

76
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,440
uh can the processes that we are

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,320
discussing be offered to all authors

78
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
during all 48

79
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,639
uh and then more into the details uh

80
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,880
what would pull requests and diffs look

81
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
like

82
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,880
so my own agenda bash

83
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
is that we skip

84
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,919
going over the previous experiments that

85
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,400
would save us a little bit of time

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,120
and give us more time to talk

87
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
or are people okay with that or would

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,120
they like to

89
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,280
to get an overview of what we've done in

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,600
the past

91
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,680
maybe just move it to the end and if we

92
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
have time

93
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,280
okay

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
all right

95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,360
so just briefly um just want to say that

96
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,479
we are talking about auth 48 and

97
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,280
the use of github for uh the edit state

98
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,199
the rfc editor state

99
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,960
uh we're not going to cover

100
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
um the edit state we do all sorts of

101
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,400
stuff uh we start with um

102
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,280
you know could be just text files or v2

103
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,560
or v3

104
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,919
and

105
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:08,720
we

106
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,199
we make changes to those we move them to

107
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,039
v3

108
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,160
and

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
through multiple passes

110
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,960
we

111
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,520
make various edits everything from

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,919
adjusting commas to asking questions

113
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,319
about uh passage clarity

114
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,880
then you know the rfc editor state

115
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,160
that's a pass by another editor

116
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,039
uh and and when we are done with the

117
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,440
documents

118
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,400
we present them during all 48 so we have

119
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
our

120
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,880
xml file with the questions in them

121
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,680
and the files that we present so you can

122
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
see the changes that we've made

123
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,960
so

124
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,960
what we're focusing on is how authors

125
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,400
would want to use github and

126
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
perhaps

127
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,039
an experiment for auth48

128
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,680
we've done this a few times already

129
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,080
so here are the previous experiments

130
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,199
and if you follow the link there's a lot

131
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,800
more information

132
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,160
and it also includes the feedback from

133
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,240
the authors and the editors when we got

134
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,960
it

135
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,000
um

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
one of the the documents the authors did

137
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,080
not um respond to the survey

138
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,639
but uh

139
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,560
if we have time we can come back to

140
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,800
these slides

141
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,680
all right

142
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,479
so

143
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,199
the next slides are just capturing at a

144
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,240
high level what people put on the agenda

145
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,479
page and i've organized them from from

146
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,680
the broadest topics

147
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,319
and then they get more specific as we go

148
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,680
on

149
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,560
so

150
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,400
the first topic is

151
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,199
when we say github

152
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
what benefits and features um or do we

153
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,479
want from this

154
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,639
so are we talking

155
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,440
uh tracking content changes

156
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,000
the distributed authoring issue tracking

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,039
pull requests audit trails what do we

158
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,280
want

159
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,039
mike i see you're in the queue

160
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,680
mike fisher i i think the answer here is

161
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
kind of yes

162
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,479
um

163
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,039
and we do want the audit trail of what

164
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,799
changes were made we want um

165
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,399
we want to be able

166
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,399
when there's a this document to be able

167
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,560
to pull in

168
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,880
like start from where we were already

169
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
have it ready to go

170
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,519
um we

171
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,279
when we worked on the quick documents a

172
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,279
big part of it was that changes were

173
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,000
sent out to the working group of if you

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,360
if you're interested this is what's

175
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,399
happening

176
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,839
so there was transparency which

177
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,240
i currently i know there's work on

178
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,680
making the 48 be its own list and

179
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,880
have that be

180
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,560
visible to anybody who wants to read but

181
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,399
i feel like auth 48 is kind of a black

182
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,160
box right now

183
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,600
where the working group finishes the

184
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
document and then the rfc is published

185
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,519
and some changes happened in the

186
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,640
meantime and the rest of the working

187
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,519
group didn't see those

188
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,160
so i think above all to me it's the

189
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,640
transparency and it's the

190
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,360
having the edit trail

191
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
martin

192
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,000
yeah so

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
i'm going to slightly

194
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,080
disagree maybe and maybe add to what um

195
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
what mike just said uh the

196
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,440
the thing that i was i've been looking

197
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,279
for from this process is really the

198
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,600
ability to review the changes as they

199
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
come in that's that's basically it

200
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,200
um

201
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,480
and

202
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
that has been rather difficult

203
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,720
um because they tend to tend to arrive

204
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,800
all this one one giant blob an

205
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,880
undifferentiated mass where you have xml

206
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
changes you have

207
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,000
um minor

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
grammar grammar and uh

209
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
so forth editing so commas and

210
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,560
which and that and all those sorts of

211
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,480
other things piled in there

212
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,600
um

213
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,519
as well as some of the more substantive

214
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,360
stuff where there's a sentence that's

215
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,279
unclear and the

216
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,519
there's an edit being made to to improve

217
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,120
the clarity

218
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,600
plus all of the issues that are raised

219
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,360
in in the process

220
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
so um

221
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
to give an example

222
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,839
um

223
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,760
when we when we did quick we essentially

224
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,399
had to go through the entire document

225
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,000
looking for each one of these things as

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,480
we went down so the the first thing that

227
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
we did was looked at the i think the

228
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,160
text output because you can get a nice

229
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,519
clean diff

230
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,760
and you look for the the textual changes

231
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,279
and you go through all of that

232
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,720
and then you sort out the differences

233
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,839
there

234
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,160
and you merge in all of those changes

235
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,040
that

236
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,560
that are good and then you have

237
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,279
a an xml document that you can compare

238
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,880
to the other one and look at the xml

239
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,720
changes and so on and so forth and it

240
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,600
requires a lot of iterations

241
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
so for me this is not about the auth 48

242
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,240
process as much as it is the editing

243
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,360
process

244
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,320
because

245
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,040
having the

246
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,959
editing process be transparent to the

247
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,800
authors of the document

248
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,560
means that it's much easier to see the

249
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,399
changes that are that are coming through

250
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
at the end

251
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,640
and we we might use issue tracking and

252
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,920
pull requests and all sorts of other

253
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,079
things but that's just a consequence of

254
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,120
trying to make it transparent

255
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,000
julian

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,839
are there

257
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,079
so

258
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,040
first of all i agree with what was just

259
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,720
said um

260
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,639
we've been through all copyright for the

261
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,720
http docs

262
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
last month

263
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,160
and um

264
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,720
so i

265
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,600
some of them were marked up in cram down

266
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,120
some in native xml

267
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,560
the main

268
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,079
issue that

269
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,519
i see and i'm just rephrasing what um

270
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,760
martin essentially said um for our specs

271
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,839
we actually

272
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,720
want to have a track record about what

273
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
changed when and why and have that

274
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,920
complete

275
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,160
so when we started on the revision of

276
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,600
the http specs we could actually

277
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,480
start from a source code repository that

278
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,079
had the whole history of the specs since

279
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,079
15 years ago or something something like

280
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,279
that

281
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,240
and now in the edit an auth 48 phrase

282
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,519
unless we

283
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,000
backport every single change

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
we lose that information

285
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,200
and backporting these changes means that

286
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
we have to look at each change and see

287
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,360
whether it's just a

288
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,200
typo fix an editorial improvement um

289
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
some bigger change that came up during

290
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,279
oauth 48 which requires a working group

291
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,839
discussion

292
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,519
potentially so as martin said most of

293
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,560
that apparently is during edit not

294
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,959
during earth 48

295
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,560
so um

296
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,320
i think that's really what what we need

297
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,279
to look at and um

298
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,560
i don't

299
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
i don't think we should look at the

300
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,040
actual technology for that

301
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,079
right now maybe at the end but we should

302
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,040
try to understand why people

303
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,279
how much transparency we need

304
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,440
i mean if it's some kind of public

305
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,160
repository that's good um

306
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
whether it's github or something else is

307
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,760
a different discussion

308
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,519
but it's very important to understand

309
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,480
why people want this

310
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,680
thank you

311
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,360
eric

312
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
yeah i mean i would largely

313
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,279
agree what martin said um is like

314
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,240
critically important to be able to

315
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,519
distinguish every single change that's

316
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,959
been made and figure out why it's been

317
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:13,760
made

318
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,360
and not have to like

319
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
you know wade through like a bunch of

320
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,160
changes which are fundamentally not

321
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,360
don't change the text but only change

322
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,040
formatting and look at the changes to

323
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,639
make formatting and have this separated

324
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,959
out um the other thing that's important

325
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,800
is to actually

326
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,440
allow the authors and the ads and the

327
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
rpc to collaborate during the final

328
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,240
phase of this

329
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,399
um as changes that

330
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,000
as the final read-through happens and

331
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,199
you notice changes and they have to be

332
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,279
tracked and they have to be managed the

333
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,399
process and having those in emails um is

334
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,279
like very difficult um and finally um

335
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,480
being able to understand what the state

336
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,560
of the document is at any given time

337
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,440
um

338
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,639
uh is also critical um so

339
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,720
uh you know to get

340
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
a repository like yet always has the

341
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,120
current state in invest in maine but

342
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
um you know for instance uh

343
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,959
administration where um you know you

344
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,639
don't you download the xml file from the

345
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,079
from the from the site it's the same url

346
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,199
every time so you know that later

347
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,399
changed and you can't like track those

348
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,079
changes it's difficult so having like

349
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,519
being able having like basically

350
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,600
checkpoints that are having every change

351
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,279
be accounted for and every change and

352
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,880
knowing why everything happened is like

353
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,199
the main thing

354
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,599
thank you

355
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,079
michael

356
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
um my uh my view is i mean i don't want

357
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,160
to contradict anyone else actually i

358
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
agree with them very much um but

359
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,399
specifically the thing that i see is

360
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,839
that we get uh inconsistent amount of

361
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,920
engagement from authors they don't know

362
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,279
where it's going on or whether they're

363
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,959
reviewing the current state and i think

364
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,199
that's what eckerd's kind of getting at

365
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,600
the we need the latest thing and they

366
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,839
need to be looking at what's going on

367
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,399
um and so to to a certain extent i think

368
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,399
that that um

369
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,800
it's actually uh it's actually issue

370
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,480
tracking and

371
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,880
the ability to have an author say quite

372
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,959
easily yes i agree with this yes i agree

373
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,040
with this this is the part i have a

374
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,320
problem with

375
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,399
um and i think that particularly with

376
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,720
the big long diffs and the emails some

377
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,000
of us are really good at going through

378
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,240
them and some authors are really not

379
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,880
um they really need to be spoon-fed the

380
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,720
individual changes

381
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,800
to think about and

382
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,560
i think actually we can probably cut our

383
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,920
off 48 time significantly this way

384
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,639
um that uh by doing this

385
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,360
um so

386
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,079
you

387
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,320
um mike bishop yeah so back up again um

388
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
nothing has been said that i disagree

389
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,959
with i think um

390
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,519
to expand on a couple of those

391
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,519
julian mentioned in passing one thing

392
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,959
that i think makes this a little more

393
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,480
complicated

394
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,399
which is that not all of us author an

395
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,079
xml

396
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,279
and so

397
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,079
you know

398
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,880
i was working in markdown i got the xml

399
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,800
diff and the text diff back

400
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
and then i

401
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,480
you know retconned all of those into my

402
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,000
markdown file so that it would produce

403
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,240
that xml file

404
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,359
and

405
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,919
in the process imposed github on my auth

406
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,799
48 even though the rpc wasn't

407
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,039
um

408
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,439
and that took a while

409
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,039
but um

410
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,439
the other thing i wanted to highlight uh

411
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,160
ecker was mentioning ad reviews i did

412
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,079
find it very helpful

413
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,200
during off 48 for http 3.

414
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,520
when the email went to the ads of here

415
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,039
are substantive changes that were made

416
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,160
in all 48 80s do you approve it

417
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,400
and then i was immediately able to

418
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
follow up with and here's the issue

419
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,760
discussion here's the pr where this

420
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,440
happened

421
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,520
and i got an email from the ads saying

422
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,039
thank you that made it very easy to

423
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,360
review

424
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,679
uh julian i see that you're still in the

425
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,039
queue uh

426
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,240
did you have a another comment oh okay

427
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,440
um

428
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,480
and then ecker did you want to follow up

429
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,919
on someone else's comments

430
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,840
no i just didn't get out of the cube

431
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,200
okay

432
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,919
all right robert

433
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,520
so i wanted to

434
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,960
um

435
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,320
point to some corners in some of the

436
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,640
statements that um

437
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
julian and mike have made

438
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
and asked for thinking about the

439
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,480
implications

440
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,520
julian

441
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,760
in particular talked about the working

442
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,160
group having the history going back

443
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,840
years for a document and wanting to

444
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,360
maintain that

445
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,879
and there is an implied

446
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
requirement

447
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,559
i think

448
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,080
that

449
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,520
the process make it easy for you to feed

450
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,400
things back into the same technology

451
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,240
that the working group had been using

452
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,320
all of that time

453
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,799
um at least heard strong complaints

454
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,080
about having to go in and and copy

455
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,799
things back into the format that the

456
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,280
working group had been using

457
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,120
and as we're working our way through

458
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,799
this problem

459
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,080
think about what would happen if um for

460
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
instance one of the things that that

461
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,320
jay's been poking at

462
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
if we

463
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,039
actually

464
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,120
explicitly created a different authoring

465
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,120
grammar and publication grammar

466
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
um

467
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,160
whether

468
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,120
you know

469
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,039
what impact that would have on

470
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
attempting to

471
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,400
have the working group use the tooling

472
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
that they were used to using during the

473
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,559
document development during the off-48

474
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,039
process versus moving into

475
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,760
potentially a different technology

476
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,520
that was tracking

477
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,120
changes during that period

478
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
thank you

479
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,679
rich

480
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,200
yeah i just wanna um a couple of people

481
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,400
have touched on it but just to make it

482
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,000
really explicit um about a third of all

483
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,159
drafts submitted in the past year were

484
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,320
written in some form of markdown

485
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,200
and

486
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,480
i understand that you want to work the

487
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,200
rpc needs to work with the publication

488
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,000
format um but

489
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,080
it's difficult mike has talked and go

490
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,799
about how he had to go back and forth i

491
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,720
had the same thing with my little 10

492
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,559
page draft

493
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,480
maybe there's ways to

494
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,080
tie the

495
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,360
black to xml

496
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
stuff so there's it adds comments back

497
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,799
to the original line numbers or

498
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,480
something like that so that when you

499
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,760
make comments

500
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,679
i don't expect that

501
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,840
uh the rpc can support all input formats

502
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,000
but clearly you know

503
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,320
one third are now in one of two

504
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,400
basically one more than a quarter of

505
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,720
them are in cram-down format

506
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,880
better support for that one way or

507
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,720
another is i think going to be an

508
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,840
increasingly

509
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,039
big requirement thanks

510
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,720
kirsten

511
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,280
unmuting is really slow on this

512
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,480
that one

513
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,000
sorry um i should have done that before

514
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,720
i'm really trying to focus here on the

515
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,880
authoring process as a whole

516
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,640
and

517
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,799
auth 48 is is an important

518
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,200
period in that authoring

519
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,360
process it's preceded by working group

520
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,720
work author work and so on it's followed

521
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,880
by working group work and author work in

522
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,320
many many cases because there are this

523
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,240
documents and

524
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,559
of course in in that miss work as other

525
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,880
people have said it it's really useful

526
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,480
to be able to see

527
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,159
uh who did what

528
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,760
uh uh why

529
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,679
so um right now we we get the the

530
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,840
finished

531
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,000
xml files

532
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,159
the the non-prepped ones those that are

533
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,400
still in the authoring version of rfc

534
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,559
xml and not not the publication

535
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,520
version

536
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
and we run those through an upconverter

537
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,960
and and get back marked down

538
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,280
but that of course has a lot of

539
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,400
formatting um done different that has

540
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
become better with

541
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,720
the rpc no longer reformatting things i

542
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,240
have heard

543
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
uh i haven't actually been part of a

544
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,840
process where where that was important

545
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,720
yet

546
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,240
um but uh

547
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,559
what i really would like to focus on is

548
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,320
the the authoring processes the long

549
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,520
process of 48 is a period somewhere in

550
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,120
that process

551
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,960
and the better it actually

552
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,520
integrates with the the other parts

553
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,679
before and after that

554
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,360
the easier it is to create

555
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
quality documents

556
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,760
i i did want to follow up on your

557
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,799
comment that the rpc is not formatting

558
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,400
um

559
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,280
in

560
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
in what way because we

561
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,720
we do

562
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
actually our formatting steps are at the

563
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,600
very beginning we we get the a a

564
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,720
document uh it could be a v

565
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,760
two could be text could be v three

566
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,919
but our formatting pass is at the

567
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,120
beginning

568
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,760
um and and that's when we're looking at

569
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,400
uh lists and tables and artwork and

570
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
source code

571
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,039
and getting it all up to a certain level

572
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,799
of v3

573
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,200
yeah i was talking about the the xml

574
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,400
formatting so do you insert line breaks

575
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
in the xml source that is are of no

576
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,159
consequences

577
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,799
output try not to yes

578
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,360
so that's a significant improvement

579
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,760
all right

580
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,158
thank you

581
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,840
paul hoffman

582
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,960
um

583
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,919
so

584
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,200
i think

585
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,120
from the previous comments and

586
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
especially from

587
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,320
you know what carson just said

588
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,480
we call it off auth48 it's obviously not

589
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,080
auth 48 anymore um but we still are

590
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,440
treating it as a monolithic step

591
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,799
um a draft goes into the rfc editor it

592
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,320
is not seen again until it is edited and

593
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,640
formatted and whatever and then there is

594
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,360
a list of there's the question is this

595
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,400
good

596
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,840
um

597
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,720
given that we're talking about tools

598
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,760
and tools don't have to be a single step

599
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,240
a different proposal would be that in

600
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,760
fact we get rid of the concept of off 48

601
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,080
we keep the concept of

602
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
final sign off

603
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,720
but in fact if something comes in as a

604
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,960
text file or as markdown

605
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
that the rpc first does

606
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,640
an editing pass not a formatting pass

607
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,080
they do the you know and and that comes

608
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,200
out at least in my experience in auth48

609
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
ignoring formatting editing comes out in

610
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,039
approximately two buckets

611
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,080
editorial and questions

612
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,880
um editorial i actually look through

613
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
because i'm sort of picking on that's in

614
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,960
witches sorry about that

615
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,400
i'm not as bad as some of your other

616
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,080
authors who will disagree with you on

617
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,799
those but i do check on those

618
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
um

619
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,880
if in fact the process is an editorial

620
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,080
process followed by a formatting process

621
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,159
and and then of course the authors have

622
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,799
to to do a second sign off

623
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,200
and the editorial process is done on the

624
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,039
input format

625
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,200
it would make it

626
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,559
it would get you better answers to

627
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,720
is this right how does this look those

628
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,679
won't get lost as easily and it also

629
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,039
means quite frankly i think for the

630
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,559
formatting passer was it's going to go

631
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,880
yeah yeah right whatever you know like

632
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,600
that they actually don't care about that

633
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,520
you know like the worst thing you could

634
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
do is make their lists wrong

635
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,080
and you know that even that i would

636
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,480
suspect is extremely rare

637
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,440
um

638
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,679
so i i know this means sort of radically

639
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,039
rethinking how it's done and it includes

640
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,240
another set of interactions

641
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,480
but the outcome will be that the authors

642
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,799
understand things more and so i'm going

643
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,480
to get to my second point because it's

644
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
related

645
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,960
a problem that i've had on documents is

646
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,840
that

647
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,960
auth48 currently gets sent out as a

648
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,400
message

649
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,360
and then somebody is expected to say yes

650
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,880
or no

651
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,279
when there's multiple authors

652
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,600
sometimes the authors disagree and i've

653
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,440
had i don't remember what it was but

654
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,200
sometime in the last two years i was in

655
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
a situation where because i'm fast

656
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,919
i said yes to things and one of my

657
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,480
co-authors said no

658
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,159
and i don't know how that might have

659
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,240
messed you all up you might have started

660
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,960
taking paul's yeses and you know going

661
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,760
ahead and then had to backtrack but the

662
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,600
email from that got messy very quickly

663
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,080
and basically my co-author just gave up

664
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,240
because i had jumped in too quickly

665
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,080
i think if things are done

666
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,679
in you know where the editorial pass

667
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,039
requires

668
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,399
all authors to have signed off on the

669
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,240
final bit of the editorial you're going

670
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
to get the fast folks like paul who go

671
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,120
in and say yes no yes no and or mostly

672
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,200
yes yes yes yes

673
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,240
and

674
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,440
if the other authors want that's fine

675
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
but this goes back to especially what

676
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,480
martin was asking for was tracking in

677
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,159
the process

678
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,799
because just because i said yes and now

679
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,120
the text looks like this doesn't mean

680
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,520
that that's what my co-author wants and

681
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,919
in particular doesn't mean what my ad

682
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,679
wants

683
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,760
and then again just do the formatting at

684
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,159
the end i know the formatting's not

685
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,880
trivial but for us authors

686
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,760
the outcome of the formatting is trivial

687
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,600
we're just going to say yes unless you

688
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,279
got a bulleted list to be a numbered

689
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,440
list or something like that by and large

690
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,880
on that stuff

691
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,279
thanks yeah thank you

692
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,640
and uh just to comment on um

693
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,399
how we process author answers yes we

694
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,799
assume that the author

695
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,159
speaking is already uh checked with

696
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,480
their co-authors and um

697
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,120
we go forward with the feedback we

698
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,840
receive if an author comes back later

699
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,320
and says they

700
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,799
that's basically never true i believe i

701
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,799
mean even in documents that i'm not

702
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,039
co-author on that i've watched

703
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,279
um i believe that that is basically

704
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,760
never true

705
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,840
and the email is a discussion

706
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,440
the email is on the email thread is the

707
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,799
discussion

708
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,120
yes

709
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,760
julian

710
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,960
actually sometimes this is even not true

711
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,840
for a single author because like me in

712
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,320
past 48 i had forgotten that i had

713
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,080
agreed to something

714
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,440
weeks before

715
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,840
um i wanted to

716
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,480
say something about what you just said

717
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,760
earlier

718
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,840
about format conversion which is very

719
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,120
important for you

720
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,440
and for the whole process but i think

721
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,360
most of the people sitting here are

722
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,159
already submitting these three documents

723
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,720
either because they edit them or because

724
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,440
krembo generates them for them

725
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,880
so um that might explain why

726
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,120
lots of the feedback that you get isn't

727
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
concerned about that step

728
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,600
so that's just an explanation because

729
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,320
those people submitting plain text or v2

730
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
documents probably are not here in this

731
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,760
meeting

732
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,279
and

733
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,919
the other thing i wanted to comment on

734
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,520
was robert who

735
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,880
i think asked whether i actually wanted

736
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,320
the edits of the rpc to be done in my

737
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,880
source control system in my native

738
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,120
repository and of course the answer to

739
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,720
this is

740
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,960
in a perfect world yes if that would be

741
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,080
possible

742
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,120
but we have a large spectrum between

743
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,039
what the author has

744
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,840
used for editing and tracking

745
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,399
and what we currently use emails about

746
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,399
48 and this

747
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,679
and um we don't need to go from zero

748
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,320
percent to what one hundred percent

749
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,200
uh it would be good if you can at least

750
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,039
find a way that

751
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,200
as others said um

752
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,320
theory editorial stuff is clear clearly

753
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,039
separated from other changes so

754
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,000
they can be looked and tracked in groups

755
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,559
instead of a monolithical thing

756
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,600
thank you

757
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,720
uh ecker

758
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,360
yeah i mean i i was actually gotten cute

759
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,279
to say much what paul said um

760
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,480
you know

761
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,519
um just i mean operationally like i find

762
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,720
the two biggest challenges in this

763
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,960
process are um

764
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,480
one back parting all the material to

765
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,039
mark down because like i want when i

766
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,559
want to prepare abyss i want to have the

767
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,279
markdown look like the um

768
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,200
uh you know produce roughly the same

769
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,880
text as previously the case so i don't

770
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,080
think we do it again

771
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,799
um and that's like enormous challenge um

772
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,279
and then uh finding and as i say

773
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,880
disentangling all the different changes

774
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,919
um

775
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,600
uh you know in a traditional document

776
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,279
preparation process um you would have a

777
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,559
proofreading you're sorry i have a copy

778
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,840
editing phase which is done entirely on

779
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,919
this on the on the source text um with

780
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,440
no type setting at all and you have

781
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
proofreading phasers down on the on the

782
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
type setting on the typeset manuscript

783
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,240
um you know on the galley proofs and um

784
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,679
so we don't have that we have one phase

785
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,960
and and like really we need to separate

786
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,080
those in order to like actually have

787
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,480
things work out properly um

788
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,360
i understand there's a certain

789
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,720
reluctance to work in like multiple

790
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,760
circumstant formats um you know

791
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,120
my sense is

792
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,000
that

793
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,760
we could tolerate more than one but

794
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,760
probably not infinite um

795
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,120
uh so

796
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,080
um you know i think my put would be

797
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,640
like obviously smlv3 anything else which

798
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,159
has like a really large user base where

799
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,159
i think cram down is at this point um

800
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,600
and then you know if we're gonna do a

801
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,360
copy edit phase and people insist on

802
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,240
using something that was not one of

803
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,480
those things the copy edit can happen

804
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,559
simply by marking up the actual text

805
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,240
files as opposed to marking up the

806
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,679
source format and then people can

807
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,960
backport them into their own stuff and

808
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,399
you can proofread it out

809
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,360
um but i think like the i mean i guess

810
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,120
one thing i would say is that like in a

811
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,720
traditional document preparation format

812
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,080
the author is responsible for making the

813
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,600
copy edited changes the copy is

814
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,039
responsible for making the copy edit and

815
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,320
telling the officers about them and

816
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,760
we've inverted that process which puts

817
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,200
like a lot of burden on the authors to

818
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,360
like dope out what the changes were um

819
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,320
and tools can make that easier but like

820
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,480
um you know that that's probably that's

821
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,440
part of the source of the problem here

822
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,840
uh robert

823
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,880
yeah i'm going to go

824
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,399
risk going slightly out of scope um

825
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,120
i'll keep it short

826
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,840
i'd like to

827
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,919
ask people to think about a future that

828
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,440
looks quite a bit different than the one

829
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,679
that we are currently making consider

830
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,600
talking about making small changes to

831
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,640
and making a big change to the way that

832
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,360
we process our documents

833
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,519
and i'm all speak in terms of

834
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,480
implementation just to get through this

835
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,080
quickly

836
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,440
consider something like a state during

837
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,600
isg processing before iesg approval

838
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,080
where the isg was otherwise about to

839
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,399
send something the rsc editor queue

840
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,800
but then sent a period where the rsc

841
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,280
editor and the working group iterated on

842
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,440
substantive changes

843
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,599
and finished the iteration on

844
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,320
substantive changes in

845
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,359
without working on output format at all

846
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,159
just working on the content of the text

847
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,719
before the isg actually hit the approval

848
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,839
button

849
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,119
and then the number of

850
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,280
changes that people would be reviewing

851
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,320
in all 48 really would be more

852
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,320
publication kinds of changes rather than

853
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,599
clarity kind of changes

854
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,959

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,399
um so i think that really boils down to

856
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,879
the same suggestion that paul made that

857
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,640
you do the

858
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,960
the copy editing first

859
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,160
and and going back to my recent

860
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,560
experience with uh with h3 and before

861
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
that was quick

862
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,240
we made the changes in markdown we

863
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,040
produced a new output xml and sent that

864
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,960
back to the rfc editor

865
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,000
and then you had to do all your

866
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,839
formatting over again and i'm very sorry

867
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,960
about that

868
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,760
but

869
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,599
effectively it means that the formatting

870
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,079
happened at the end anyway like paul is

871
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,640
suggesting

872
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,960
and you also discovered something that

873
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,359
was in the document that i didn't even

874
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,320
realize the markdown could not produce

875
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,440
and

876
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,800
you fix it for me and it's still and

877
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,240
it's still not right in the repo because

878
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,078
i can't get the mark down to do that

879
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,839
sounds like um something an issue to

880
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,440
open up on markdown

881
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,119
um

882
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,240
jay

883
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,959
okay cool

884
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,000
um

885
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,960
so

886
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
uh sorry if i don't make that much sense

887
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,200
i'm currently i'm covered isolating but

888
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,400
um hopefully i'll get this right um

889
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,640
i think it's important to remember that

890
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,520
the um rpc is a professional publishing

891
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,240
function um that's a well-established

892
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,599
thing that we have

893
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,920
and that means that at some point

894
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,000
change control of the document will move

895
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
from the authors to the professional

896
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,240
publishing function and we've decided

897
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,480
that that's auth 48

898
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,280
and that means then that at that point

899
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,960
as well as them having change control

900
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,720
it's their processes

901
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,880
um that they do

902
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,720
that they think fit best with them for

903
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,640
them to be able to manage it

904
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,440
so

905
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,640
um

906
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,320
on that basis i think we need to

907
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,160
separate out two second thing two

908
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,599
separate things here

909
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,760
the first is the requirement for

910
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,160
being able to track and

911
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,640
categorize and understand the individual

912
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,040
changes made by the rpc

913
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,960
um i think that's

914
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,920
um

915
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,720
a straightforward requirement um but we

916
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,359
need to remember how the editors work as

917
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,079
gene explained they work as human beings

918
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,680
they don't go through and do right i'll

919
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,520
do one pass for this then one pass for

920
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,960
that then one pass for that then one

921
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,079
pass for that they go through the

922
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,240
document and whatever stands out for the

923
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,720
document is what they um they tackle

924
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,520
so

925
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,119
if we want to

926
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,680
fix that i think rather than expecting

927
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,400
the rpc to change their processes

928
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,920
we need to look at the technology to

929
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,359
understand how we can use the technology

930
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,040
to do that

931
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,599
now that change tracking is actually

932
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,320
quite separate from the other thing that

933
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,079
a number of people have raised here

934
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,119
which is tying that those changes back

935
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,880
to the original source format and

936
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,400
authoring process

937
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,520
um

938
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,240
that is actually a significantly harder

939
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,920
problem um i understand the this issue

940
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,240
but i'm not convinced that trying to fix

941
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
that for every id up front is

942
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,400
necessarily the best way forward and

943
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,160
again i think that we should perhaps

944
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,079
consider some technical solutions for

945
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,119
dealing with this particular issue um if

946
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,440
for example we had

947
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,359
perfect bi-directional translation

948
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,320
between markdown and xml

949
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
then that would resolve a lot of things

950
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,480
so i'd just like us to try to separate

951
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,079
those things out a little bit and see if

952
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,040
we can you know apply some technical

953
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,560
skills in order to fix these things

954
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,920
thank you

955
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,320
colin

956
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,240
so um i i wanted to it's actually oddly

957
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,440
this sort of speaks to some of jay's

958
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,599
points here i mean i i often hear sort

959
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,280
of arguments of like well if there's

960
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,800
this this professional group that does

961
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,480
things a certain way it doesn't and it

962
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,880
is a very professional group right but

963
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,480
because it is a group that we contract

964
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,640
and do contract with and it is a

965
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,920
professional group that does that full

966
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,880
times i mean you know we teach most new

967
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,079
authors to use xml or markdown or one of

968
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,280
those things in a matter of a couple of

969
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,040
hours github is another couple hours

970
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,000
like i definitely think that we should

971
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,839
take as part of the solution space for

972
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,320
this we should not re you know obviously

973
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,920
the rfc editor could learn how to do

974
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,680
documents in any one of these things in

975
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,520
a completely trivial amount of time

976
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,680
compared to the overall time we pay them

977
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,960
for every year

978
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,119
um so i do think that we need to figure

979
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,440
out a tool path and tool chain that that

980
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,160
works on this um i do

981
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
i agree very much with the the the

982
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,320
separation of the the two you know ideas

983
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,800
that people talk about here one of being

984
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,320
understanding the changes and why they

985
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,680
were made and a different one of the

986
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,920
back porting type issues

987
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,640
um but it doesn't really seem that

988
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,640
difficult to solve both of those and not

989
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,119
in in every way possible but you know

990
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,800
for some limited subset of the of the

991
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,720
major tools that we use

992
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,880
uh and look we're never the whole point

993
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,440
of using markdown it is grossly simpler

994
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,839
than xml so there will never be

995
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,680
bi-directional between the two the whole

996
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
point of markdown was not to have as

997
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,520
much accessibility not have all the

998
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,160
features the xml had right so we can't

999
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,760
look for a technical solution to map

1000
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,119
between those two because the design

1001
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,359
constraint of the markdown what makes it

1002
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,760
good to use is that it doesn't have that

1003
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,599
you can't do that so we have to stay out

1004
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,880
of trying to come up with some you know

1005
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,800
pixie magic to do this we should just

1006
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
look at the normal ways that everyone's

1007
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,400
working on the tools we have today and

1008
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,760
what's an efficient way to use them and

1009
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,359
it's pretty obvious what those answers

1010
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,160
are yet we don't seem to use them

1011
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,920
we use them in the working group

1012
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,680
yet we don't seem to use them between

1013
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,200
this this process we have these two sort

1014
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,880
of isolated you know the working group

1015
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
does it this way

1016
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,839
editor does it this way maybe both of

1017
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,200
those are fine but when they're trying

1018
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,720
to work together which they are in this

1019
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,079
late stage

1020
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,040
we have to find a way to do that and i i

1021
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,440
totally reject the idea that

1022
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,520
um you know the rci there's a black box

1023
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,960
and can't change the way it works i mean

1024
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,440
obviously again so thank you

1025
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,520
thank you

1026
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,079
uh paul

1027
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,400
um so a couple things on other things

1028
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,240
people have said um

1029
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,560
i think ecker was being too conservative

1030
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,160
when he said

1031
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,319
you know we can only work on like one or

1032
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,280
two

1033
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,160
uh for that that the rpc could only work

1034
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,800
on one or two formats given that it's

1035
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,079
all text

1036
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,800
then i would say in fact

1037
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,520
any editor at least in my experience

1038
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
with working with you know not only with

1039
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,520
the rpc but with a whole bunch of

1040
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,599
different book publishers and stuff

1041
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,760
can handle pretty much any kind of text

1042
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,560
format so it could be xml v2 v3

1043
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
markdown or because i know you guys

1044
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,800
still get plain old text

1045
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,160
it's not trivial to jump between those

1046
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,880
mentally but it's also not difficult if

1047
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,560
the first pass is the editorial and you

1048
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,119
know the editorial pass which again

1049
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,359
i've seen over the years i thought the

1050
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,480
rpc has done an excellent job of editing

1051
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
when it's editing and putting questions

1052
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,880
when it's not simple editing i mean

1053
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,920
that's been very very clear

1054
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,000
oftentimes if i was going to be critical

1055
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,079
i would say oh that's a silly question

1056
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,079
that's just an editorial question go

1057
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,520
ahead and do it

1058
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,440
but that's fine i mean i'm not saying

1059
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,560
undo that so i disagree with jay about

1060
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,400
you know oh

1061
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,319
a person goes through and we can't

1062
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,079
expect them to go through multiple times

1063
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,920
we don't need to expect to go through

1064
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,960
multiple times the output currently

1065
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
and certainly before we we started on

1066
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,720
the xml was just fine for

1067
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,040
i know it's editorial if it's just you

1068
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,440
know if i'm seeing a change bar and i

1069
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,200
know it's a question because they call

1070
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,680
it out as a question

1071
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,599
i think that that works

1072
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,079
you know very very well

1073
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,000
um

1074
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,720
i

1075
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,359
am intrigued by robert's proposal

1076
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,520
it has one big advantage that we haven't

1077
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,000
talked about here which is

1078
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,920
a non-trivial number of

1079
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,560
drafts before they become rfcs but after

1080
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,119
they've passed the ietf review get

1081
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,240
significant technical changes that the

1082
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,640
ietf doesn't get to review

1083
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,520
um

1084
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,960
where in in some cases the ad gets to

1085
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,000
review it but the isg does not

1086
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,160
um and quite frankly sometimes this has

1087
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,440
a pretty negative effect um certainly on

1088
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,720
the morale

1089
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,119
in the ietf when people go well wait a

1090
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,160
sec

1091
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,839
you guys reverse something that we had

1092
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,200
already talked about in the working

1093
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,800
group oh it was done in auth 48.

1094
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,359
so i like robert's idea of possibly

1095
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,599
doing some of this

1096
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,200
and having the isg sign off on

1097
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,119
something that is probably going to then

1098
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,359
mostly be formatted

1099
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,040
only um

1100
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,440
i suspect it won't work

1101
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,280
i suspect that

1102
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,119
that there will be too much clogging

1103
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,079
factor

1104
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,920
and it's going to make the isg's life

1105
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,560
much harder but i wouldn't mind seeing

1106
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,280
the experiment done because i do think

1107
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,040
that for the rare cases where it happens

1108
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,599
where you get technical changes it's

1109
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,119
pretty important

1110
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,160
um an alternative to at least to fix

1111
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,000
that problem is that

1112
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,800
everything that the rpc calls out as a

1113
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,760
question

1114
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,560
should be reviewed by the aed

1115
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,520
and

1116
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,839
in a perfect world should be reviewed by

1117
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
the working group if it's a working

1118
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,000
group document or by the iab if it's an

1119
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,240
iab stream document

1120
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,920
i don't think everyone needs to look at

1121
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,480
the grammar but since you guys are

1122
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,400
you guys meaning the rpc

1123
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,240
i'm sorry to misgender all of you i

1124
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,640
think um the um

1125
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,119
the rpc is already pulling out questions

1126
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,319
quite well

1127
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,240
and anybody in the working group who

1128
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,520
cares

1129
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,680
could look through those and look at the

1130
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,359
results i mean that's the nice thing we

1131
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,800
have now is

1132
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
that if there's a series of questions

1133
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,319
and the authors have come up with an

1134
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,119
answer you can look at the version

1135
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,800
before they came up with the answer and

1136
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,200
the version after and say yep that did

1137
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,160
not change anything technically

1138
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,440
just to interrupt really quick time

1139
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,720
check so i was deep yes

1140
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,599
i was just going to to mention that

1141
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,480
we've got 15 minutes

1142
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,150
and i also wanted to cut the the queue

1143
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,760
[Music]

1144
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,480
so

1145
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,319
julian

1146
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:29,440
okay i'll try to be quick

1147
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
and try not to

1148
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,400
misread what robert said earlier

1149
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,000
this time um

1150
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,480
i think if we have the case where a

1151
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,240
document has

1152
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,480
more than trivial changes between what

1153
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,680
was sent to the isg and

1154
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,839
what was set to the rfc editor we

1155
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,680
absolutely should

1156
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,079
just require a new internet drive to be

1157
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,319
published because that's the way the itf

1158
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,359
works

1159
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,200
and then people can just look at the

1160
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
diffs of the internet drafts and that's

1161
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,520
how it's supposed to work and if we have

1162
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,160
changes that are critical

1163
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,640
just saying the idea proved it and it's

1164
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,160
probably okay

1165
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,640
it's just not good enough i know that

1166
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,720
these are trying to avoid that but i

1167
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,359
think if we had a hard rule that if it's

1168
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,760
more than an editorial change we

1169
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
absolutely need a new draft that would

1170
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,240
be simplified these things a lot

1171
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,160
the other thing i wanted to mention is

1172
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,800
that many of us

1173
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,599
have quite complex two chains in the

1174
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,880
meantime for instance for the http specs

1175
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,400
we

1176
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,800
have a two chain that actually extracts

1177
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,880
the abnf checks the abnf um

1178
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,920
reformats the abn f inserts them as

1179
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,880
appendix we have auto generation of

1180
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,200
index tables and so on

1181
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,280
and that's

1182
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,480
obviously very hard if the

1183
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,280
production center wanted to

1184
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,440
use that to change that obviously would

1185
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,839
be very hard and we can't ask them to do

1186
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,040
that

1187
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,400
so um

1188
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,119
here's a thought experiment if um let's

1189
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,200
say a working group had the two chain

1190
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,040
implemented in a way that's

1191
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,000
it's a github action and that

1192
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,319
you submit a pr against the source

1193
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,480
document and then can see what comes out

1194
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,559
of that

1195
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,359
would it be uh i mean for the editing

1196
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,400
step

1197
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,599
a potential experiment to just say

1198
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,720
we'll send a pr with the editorial

1199
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,520
changes and to your source repository

1200
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,599
and see what happens

1201
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,319
instead of doing that on the

1202
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,280
converted xml file in edits in the edit

1203
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,119
phase that the authors can see

1204
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,880
so

1205
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,040
julian you're proposing the next

1206
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,800
experiment is

1207
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,440
[Music]

1208
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,960
i guess working in

1209
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,000
markdown or xml

1210
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,839
and then

1211
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,760
we do a

1212
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,280
pull request

1213
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,920
with all of our changes

1214
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,920
like

1215
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,359
submitting

1216
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,960
our

1217
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,640
auth 48

1218
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,240
xml file

1219
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,359
as the pull request or are you thinking

1220
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,839
that we make the edits

1221
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,040
um

1222
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,558
and and multiple

1223
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,599
sorry need some more details on on uh

1224
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,480
the experiment you're proposing yeah so

1225
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,200
i i think if we look at the pure copy

1226
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,480
editing phase so my assumption is and

1227
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,440
correct me if i'm wrong somebody in your

1228
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,160
group starts reading the document and

1229
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,119
either takes notes or starts to

1230
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,839
correct typos and editorial problems

1231
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,119
right away

1232
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,640
and um

1233
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,599
that may take one or two days or or more

1234
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,359
with a complex document

1235
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,640
and then this change sits in your edited

1236
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,160
documents

1237
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,800
until aust 48 when the authors get to

1238
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,440
see it right

1239
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,280
basically yes

1240
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,760
a couple of different editors um work on

1241
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,119
the document

1242
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,119
um and

1243
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,920
we are working in one document and then

1244
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,839
it is released in all 48.

1245
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,200
and my proposal would be to actually

1246
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,359
where technically possible and i'm not

1247
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,160
saying it needs to be cram down or xml

1248
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,880
because it's an experiment

1249
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,040
where it's possible i mean we could run

1250
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,680
this experiment for this small document

1251
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,960
first

1252
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,319
to actually instead of editing it in

1253
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,559
place in your

1254
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,599
office to actually submit

1255
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,559
one or several pull requests to the

1256
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,400
original

1257
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,440
well

1258
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,599
gets repository

1259
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,440
and let the authors merge that and then

1260
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,000
let them produce a new document from

1261
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,240
where you can then start the auth-48

1262
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,558
phrase

1263
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,079
something like that

1264
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,240
okay

1265
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,480
ecker

1266
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,760
yeah i just wanted to respond to a

1267
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
couple points jade made um

1268
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,440
i mean so

1269
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,440
like as much what colin said i agree

1270
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,200
with this is like professional function

1271
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,800
and but um you know it's not like

1272
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,720
virtual book publishing where you know

1273
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,319
if i do something addison wesley i must

1274
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,680
have take their process or leave it

1275
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,119
we're like the primary customer for the

1276
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,440
service and so that means like that you

1277
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,800
know within the bounds of reason we have

1278
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
a certified controller how it's executed

1279
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,680
um

1280
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,240
um in particular like you know as i said

1281
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,520
traditional publishing does have a

1282
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,720
multi-path structure so i don't think

1283
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,920
it's reasonable to ask for multi-pass

1284
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,119
structure here

1285
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,160
um

1286
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,440
um

1287
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,800
also in terms of change control switch

1288
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
is really quite nuanced right um it's

1289
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,079
sometimes the case that the publisher

1290
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,760
takes final control but i produce

1291
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,160
documents on a book in fact where i

1292
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,599
produce camera-ready copy everybody's

1293
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,599
pdf and they printed out the pdf like

1294
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,720
you know directly on their offset

1295
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,720
printers and so they never had to go to

1296
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,760
anything and they sent me marked up

1297
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,680
paper i'm not suggesting we did here but

1298
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,880
i mean the fact that these are

1299
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,319
mechanical tools that we're using the

1300
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,720
same rough tools to generate the output

1301
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,880
as um in the final publication stages we

1302
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,880
do ordinarily like means is a much more

1303
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,920
complicated demonstration than

1304
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,520
traditional book publishing or maybe

1305
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,960
they're they're you know maybe you're

1306
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,240
writing a word and they're printing in

1307
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,119
frame

1308
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,960
um and so like i heard earlier this

1309
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,800
session that like there should be a

1310
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,000
difference that a tool changes to

1311
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,079
produce the final documents than we used

1312
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,680
it at ours that would like be a huge

1313
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,599
regression um the fact that we already

1314
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,599
have this goofy situation where authors

1315
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,440
are writing one version sml e3 and it

1316
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,720
gets prepped out in some other version

1317
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,160
and published is like already a problem

1318
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,520
we should try to revert that not move

1319
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,680
forward

1320
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,960
thanks

1321
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,920
um

1322
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,720
so we're down to nine minutes rich

1323
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,800
really really quickly

1324
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,720
yeah very quickly i just want to

1325
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,760
add a gloss to paul's comments which is

1326
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,440
the area director is probably the wrong

1327
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,200
person to overload with feedback the

1328
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,359
working group chair is less loaded and

1329
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,000
more incentive to get documents out

1330
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,440
and more focused on what the working

1331
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,040
group content is and is probably in a

1332
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,720
better position

1333
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,640
to say oh this is a technical change it

1334
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,480
would affect that we should

1335
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,599
take a step back and re-review thanks

1336
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:14,400
okay

1337
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,520
thanks and uh julian sorry we had cut

1338
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,880
the cue

1339
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,680
so

1340
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,720
um

1341
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,440
very briefly uh i'll skip to the end of

1342
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,400
the slides but so we focused more on on

1343
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,480
benefits and features and we're

1344
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,720
discussing at a very high level

1345
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,200
uh what people

1346
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,319
the issues people had month 48 um and

1347
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,319
what they would like to see different

1348
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,359
so we did not touch on whether we should

1349
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,440
be using git or github or gitlab or

1350
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,440
google docs even

1351
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,000
uh we have not talked about well we did

1352
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,559
talk a little bit about should you know

1353
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,720
the editor participate in the author's

1354
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,839
repo

1355
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,960
uh julian had uh recommended that as an

1356
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,160
experiment

1357
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,040
um we did not get to the can we do this

1358
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,960
for everybody

1359
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,400
um

1360
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,400
and and this was down in the details

1361
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,760
like if we were talking about github um

1362
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,760
although i guess we did talk a bit about

1363
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,160
what these um the the diff should look

1364
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,240
like and people were

1365
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,599
um

1366
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,200
wanting to see

1367
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,319
uh

1368
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,359
perhaps multiple passes from uh the the

1369
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,799
rpc on their documents

1370
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,680
all right so uh word to the wrap up

1371
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,800
um

1372
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,280
so skimmed over what we did not talk

1373
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,800
about um

1374
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,760
and

1375
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,160
so what i was hearing

1376
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,680
from a

1377
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,359
um

1378
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,520
let me go through my notes on and

1379
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,960
summarize

1380
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,280
um

1381
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,559
people were

1382
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,319
although i said it was not scope people

1383
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,680
were talking about the the edit rfc

1384
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,640
pass

1385
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,599
rfc editor pass on the documents

1386
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:00,960
um

1387
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,119
we discussed

1388
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:03,510
um

1389
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,879
[Music]

1390
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,760
now we

1391
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,000
talked about a lot of stuff and i'm

1392
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,800
trying to figure out um what some of our

1393
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,760
next experiments might be julian did say

1394
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,960
let you know let's see if we can plan an

1395
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,720
author's repo

1396
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,400
um

1397
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,319
is there

1398
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,119
does anyone have

1399
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,760
other suggestions for a small experiment

1400
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,319
uh with some of the things discussed i

1401
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,960
see um ecker and paul are in the queue

1402
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,359
ecker

1403
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,319
just incompetence

1404
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,680
oh all right

1405
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,000
paul

1406
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:51,760
um

1407
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,839
i know it was my idea so i feel weird

1408
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,319
about suggesting it but it seemed like

1409
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,640
my idea resonated of

1410
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,079
um doing doing um an editorial pass

1411
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,079
first of some sort

1412
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,240
having have i'm seeing there's a bunch

1413
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,640
of thumbs up here um

1414
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,240
since you don't have your camera on but

1415
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:10,960
yeah

1416
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,160
there's a lot of fun

1417
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,920
uh that that's a reasonable experiment

1418
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,079
even if it it doesn't go all the way to

1419
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,680
where you went with the github

1420
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,040
experiment

1421
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,960
of doing that

1422
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,880
and then seeing how that affects your

1423
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,040
process

1424
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,640
you know it may turn out that that

1425
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,160
really sucks for your process and that

1426
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,680
would be good to know but if it doesn't

1427
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,359
suck i think that that would actually be

1428
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:33,200
a really good first step to

1429
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,400
other things

1430
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,200
um that you could then do later of and

1431
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,440
show it to the authors this way or

1432
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,359
include these people or whatever but

1433
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,839
just to see if flipping that over um

1434
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,520
actually works for you

1435
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,440
all right thank you cullen

1436
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,200
so i think you've i think what i'm

1437
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,599
proposing is is is doing more of what i

1438
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,799
think you've already done but i'm very

1439
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,960
confused about what has been done so the

1440
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,839
idea of forking a source repo or forming

1441
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,160
a new github you know for forking the

1442
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,480
source repo to have a

1443
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,040
uh a repo that is under control of the

1444
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,640
rfc editor and uh doing the changes in

1445
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,480
the source format be that xml or

1446
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,559
markdown um

1447
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,559
and and working with the collaboratively

1448
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,480
using the github series of tools to do

1449
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,000
that i i believe you've done that for

1450
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,559
both markdown and xml at this point

1451
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,160
i'm sort of worrying about like

1452
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,000
do more of that and plus one the

1453
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
editorial path separation for sure i

1454
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,079
mean is there is there a problem and

1455
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,280
i mean was there an outcome in that

1456
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,559
experiment that suggested we shouldn't

1457
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,160
be doing that or something i'm missing

1458
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:34,960
here

1459
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,440
no no not necessarily

1460
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,760
and

1461
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,760
so can we can do that we can um

1462
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,079
iterate on the the most recent

1463
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,599
experiment

1464
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,799
which was uh 9245

1465
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,240
if i've got the rfc number right

1466
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,079
right well i'm just sort of saying you

1467
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,760
know expand that and start using that to

1468
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,680
a broader set of people i mean can we

1469
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,040
have an outcome of that experiment if it

1470
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,960
was a success thumbs up combine it with

1471
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,280
the editorial separation and move

1472
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,400
forward and try some more of it i guess

1473
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,839
all right thank you

1474
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,280
ecker

1475
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,200
sorry i just lost the window i'll try to

1476
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,640
find it again

1477
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,720
okay

1478

all right well thank you very much
