said here or on the list or in the chat

32
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
or on github or any related to ietf is

33
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
considered an itf contribution and

34
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
triggers some legal responsibilities in

35
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,440
terms of disclosing patents for example

36
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,759
that you know about

37
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,560
i

38
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,759
generally don't think there are that

39
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,360
many patents when we're talking about

40
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,440

next slide

125
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,479
yeah so this is the boring part of the

126
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,759
meeting where we just give a couple of

127
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,919
updates so you know what we're doing um

128
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,000
we did manage to publish one rsc and

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
this one is actually important one it's

130
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,240
a new roc series um editor model it's

131
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
done it's implemented

132
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
where it's off our um plate so we're not

133
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,958
responsible anymore and like i provide

134
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,480
you more information

135
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
tomorrow in the plenary as well

136
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,560
um but then the documents we are

137
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
actually still responsible for

138
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
we have two workshop reports uh one is

139
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
in the rfc editor queue already and the

140
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,600
other one is in community feedback so

141
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,760
that's also done i guess feedback is

142
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,519
most um useful from people who actually

143
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
participated in the in the workshop but

144
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,480
anyway if you want to read it and

145
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
provide any comments um we're we are

146
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,959
grateful for that

147
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,360
um we have one technical document about

148
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,959
recommendations which we believe is

149
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,279
ready for community view um i don't

150
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,519
think the call went out yet but it will

151
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
very soon so so look out for that last

152
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,920
chance to comment on this document

153
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,560
um the ib thinks it's in good shape and

154
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
hopefully it's useful to the community

155
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
and

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,080
then we have one more document which is

157
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,560
under active discussion uh and we know

158
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
that this blockchain has provoked a lot

159
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,760
of discussion

160
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,640
um and and there will be more um time

161

is working group is to think about how

174
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,480
we can improve the process of making

175
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,279
protocols and documenting them

176
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,560
and we write documents aimed at

177
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,360
this

178
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,279
and we're focusing on one of those

179
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,880
documents which is uh draft ib protocol

180
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,240
maintenance

181
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,120
um which talks about

182
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,399
when

183
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,480
it might be a good idea to use the

184
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,640
robustness principle and when it might

185
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,200
not be and so we're having a

186
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,279
thursday morning meeting from 9 to 10

187
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
a.m

188
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,200
in the ib office on the floor below if

189
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,519
anyone is interested in that topic

190
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,680
please come and chat we had some really

191
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,839
good discussion on architecture discuss

192
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,200
and we're looking to publish this

193
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,640
document soon

194
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
so we're really encouraging folks to

195
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,320
come share opinions

196
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,200
um

197
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
thanks

198
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,120
yeah maybe one more comment so this is a

199
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
small room it's an open meeting

200
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,560
everybody is invited to join but like if

201
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,399
you if you're not actively participating

202
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,920
you might not fit right so it would be

203
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,880
nice to

204
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
to have those people in the room who

205
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,839
actually want to participate

206
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,320
okay and we have another technical

207
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
program which is the model t program or

208
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,600
the internet threat model program

209
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,839
and this we reported a couple of times

210
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,360
in the ib open meeting and the current

211
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
stages is that there was an interval

212
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,279
meeting um in april which discussed a

213
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,640
little bit about what are the next steps

214
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
for the program

215
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,560
um and since then there wasn't much

216
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,079
activity there was much discussion there

217
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,600
were like a few

218
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
small document updates

219
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
um but we're not sure what the way

220
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,920
forward is um and so we are actively

221
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,079
considering closing this program now and

222
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,279
that doesn't mean that like all the

223
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,880
problems are resolved or it doesn't mean

224
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,639
that the discussion is ending here but

225
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,240
it means that probably the program

226
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
doesn't provide the right venue for this

227
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,200
discussion anymore

228
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
so even if we close the program

229
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,440
discussion can go on on the architecture

230
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,000
discuss list or hopefully some of this

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,720
will actually find its way into the itf

232
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,320
or maybe there's also room in the irtf

233
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,480
but

234
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,920
the plan is to close the program so

235
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,000
we are we are still discussing this but

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,519
if you have any feedback you can provide

237
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,560
it to us

238
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
now i mean not now but you can send us

239
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,639
an email you can also provide it now but

240
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,480
i guess that's uh

241
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
that's yeah

242
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
okay

243
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,399
um then like uh again back to the more

244
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,920
less technical more

245
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,720
administrative side um

246
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
i just we just want to mention quickly

247
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,320
that we actually created two new groups

248
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
and this is really kind of for

249
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,639
um just our internal

250
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,519
um

251
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
support of our our functions so uh maybe

252
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,760
not that exciting for you but just like

253
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,920
for some transparency we have a new

254
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,120
group

255
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,839
for ietf and ieee coordination this is

256
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,680
actually not really a new group this uh

257
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,760
activity always existed we just like

258
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,839
home it now more officially on the data

259
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,120
tracker

260
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,399
so hopefully that provides more

261
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,639
visibility about the liaison work we're

262
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,000
doing there

263
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,040
um

264
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,600
and this is kind of it's uh

265
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
it's a it's a it's a closed mailing list

266
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,160
but it's like experts are invited on a

267
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,480
need basis so it's like a moving group

268
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,519
of people working on the coordination

269
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,279
and then the other new program is the

270
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,760
iab ice policy coordination

271
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,800
group

272
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,920
um and

273
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,519
this is really just to

274
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,440
intensify our relationship with ice hock

275
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,959
we have the liaison we talk to them

276
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,959
quite often and we thought that like

277
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,959
having having a group that can meet more

278
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,279
often and and can focus on topics and

279
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,560
make sure we don't miss anything

280
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
important will help us here so this is

281
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,360
brand new and and hopefully it will

282
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,199
improve our

283
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,639
relationship with isoc even more

284
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,279
okay um next is the ease on updates

285
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,120
since last time we added a slide on this

286
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
because we thought we want to

287
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,399
provide a little bit more

288
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,480
awareness about liaisons um to the

289
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,519
community

290
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,519
um not like a huge number of updates

291
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
this time but um at least there is uh

292
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,079
the rsac committee

293
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,920
which is in the process of of

294
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,079
rechartering so maybe that's information

295
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,079
that's interesting for some of you

296
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,399
and then we will have a longer update uh

297
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,839
from scott our laser manager to itu-t

298
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,279
this time

299
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,199
um to provide a more broader overview

300
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,639
what's happening in this organization so

301
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,079
that's also something new we're doing

302
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,480
right now and we go from like we start

303
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,399
with i2ut this time and then hopefully

304
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,240
the next time we we give you some more

305
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,399
updates about other organizations just

306
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,639
in general to provide more awareness and

307
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,839
coordination between the different

308
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,839
organizations

309
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,680
okay one more part here and that's the

310
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,839
more exciting part

311
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,639
workshops we are um just send out a call

312
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,399
for a workshop that we're organizing in

313
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,279
fall

314
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,800
and the workshop is on management

315
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,120
technics and encrypted networks

316
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,680
and we really want to discuss um how

317
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,760
management can be improved in encrypted

318
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
networks and also like how management

319
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,680
can be more

320
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,760
secure eventually and actually support

321
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,680
user privacy and security

322
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
so what we're looking for

323
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
is contributions about action

324
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
requirements um that are needed for

325
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,880
network management so things that like

326
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,800
are not only aspirational but like

327
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,079
actually can lead to changes um and

328
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,279
we're looking for people who are

329
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,720
interested in actually working on this

330
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,120
or provide solutions or just

331
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,560
explain solutions that maybe have been

332
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,480
provided already

333
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,720
so the call is out there please look at

334
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,959
the iab website if you there's more text

335
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,199
explaining more stuff

336
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,639
and then if you want to participate in

337
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,399
this workshop

338

342
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,440
but if you submit a position paper you

343
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,279
have good chances to get invited but we

344
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,480
really want to know

345
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,399
what your thoughts are in advance so we

346
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,600
can organize a nice workshop

347
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,800
and then this is a little bit of heads

348
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,000
up we are discussing another workshop uh

349
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,480
on ira mental environmental impacts of

350
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
internet applications and systems this

351
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
call isn't out yet

352
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
but it's coming very soon so the ib

353
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,079
already decided that we want to do this

354
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,880
the workshop will happen in december

355
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
likely so submission will be a little

356
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,880
bit later in october

357
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,160
and we're interested to actually

358
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,480
understand what the impact is what are

359
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,399
what are the right metrics to measure it

360
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,240
and what are the data that we have out

361
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,040
there

362
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,320
and like what

363
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,600
what do we understand if you put

364
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,680
everything together so watch out for

365
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,920
this as i said the call is not out yet

366
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,519
but we will send it out very soon

367
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,800
okay

368
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,719
any questions on these updates

369
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,079
ah sorry we actually yep

370
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,519
um so i wish it were a question

371
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
it's it's more uh input to the iab

372
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,959
i hope you don't close uh the model t

373
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,679
program instead i hope what the iab does

374
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,559
is inject a little energy into it um

375
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,640
ib has been a little passive about that

376
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,679
program

377
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,079
there are five drafts uh there is

378
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,240
community interest um

379
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,880
but what we seem to lack there is enough

380
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,919
energy

381
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,599
to keep the program

382
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,320
what the iab sees as a symptom

383
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,720
is something that i think the ieb could

384
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,360
solve by generating some of the energy

385
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,120
the community has contributed some

386
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,320
drafts but we like you mentioned we had

387
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,960
the one interim meeting uh that doesn't

388
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,799
seem like enough to me so my input to uh

389
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,880
my input to the iap on the model t

390
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,760
program is don't close it and if the

391
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
conversation takes place in the iab

392
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
about closing it

393
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,120
make sure that you have a place to go

394
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,440
for those documents right that you've

395
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,200
you've asked the community for input

396
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,919
you've got contributions

397
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,080
and you've closed the program please

398
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
make sure that you have a concrete plan

399
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,000
for what to do

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,360
with the contributions that you've

401
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,840
already got

402
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,400
thanks

403
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,200
so i i well understand um that desire

404
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,080
and i understand that it's very um

405
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
not satisfying if we just close the

406
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
program and there's no follow-up but

407
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,799
what we see is that the

408
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,960
purpose of this program or the purpose

409
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,039
of a lot of the iab activities that we

410
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,880
do is to kind of trigger

411
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,559
a conversation in the community to uh to

412
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,640
point the community at gaps or topics

413
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,000
that think we think we need further

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,080
discussion so that's when we created the

415
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,679
program what we wanted to achieve and we

416
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,760
don't see this goal achieved so we don't

417
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
know like if keeping the program around

418
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,360
will achieve this goal

419
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,960
there are documents which have

420
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
contributed to the discussion

421
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,480
but i think a lot of these documents

422
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,720
were not um

423
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
were not considered as being

424
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,039
publicate public published on the iab

425
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,799
stream from the beginning so this might

426
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,559
not be the right venue anyway for these

427
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,919
documents

428
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,880
um we had a discussion today that we

429
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,600
needed menu for these documents

430
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,039
um and i understand it's very

431
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,480
frustrating that i just like can't

432
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,840
create it for you but i don't think this

433
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,919
when you will be in the iab

434
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,160
and i i can only

435
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
act in the iab i can't act in the other

436
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
part of the organization so i think it's

437
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,520
actually on you

438
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
to bring these documents to keep the

439
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,880
discussion going and bring these

440
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,160
documents

441
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
into its right place and one place we

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
discussed for example is also there are

443
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
some research groups which have

444
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,520
a relationship here like um prg

445
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,360
or hrpc

446
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,559
so you might want to approach um

447
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,120
these uh chairs in these groups or you

448
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,039
also want to maybe go to the sec area

449
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,120
and keep the discussion going there

450
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,840
thanks maria um

451
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,640
so

452
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,400
we we see two people in the queue that

453
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,919
aren't in the virtual queue we'll allow

454
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,360
your questions now but please in the

455
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,039
future everyone join the virtual queue

456
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,559
we want to make sure we're fair with the

457
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,960
remote participants

458
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,760
and

459
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,919
yeah um

460
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,039
why

461
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,080
oh yeah yari since you're the chair do

462
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,480
you wanna uh of the model t group are

463
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,720
you responding to the previous point

464
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,760
i mean if you're responding to the

465
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,200
previous point i think pl you you're

466
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,960
welcome to jump the cue let the queue

467
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
drain first i'll

468
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,559
thank you sounds good go ahead and you

469
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,200
can keep your mask uh when talking just

470
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,720
keep the microphone close it works

471
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,400
really well okay thanks

472
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,960
um so just to support what mike said but

473
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,360
more importantly for model please state

474
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,400
your name for the minute oh sorry

475
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,799
dominique lizanski um i'm the author of

476
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,760
two

477
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,799
drafts for model t on threat models um

478
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,640
and and threats

479
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
uh just to say i think just to say i

480
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,120
support what mark said but also just to

481
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,280
say i think it's not on us particularly

482
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,760
but on us collectively with the iab as

483
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,080
well the threat model has changed and my

484
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,600
drafts actually show that and there's

485
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
quite a lot going on in this area and i

486
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,919
would agree with mark and his comment on

487
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,080
saying that i think it needs support and

488
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,720
input and sort of zest i would say from

489
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,640
the iab as well as from the community

490
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,320
and i haven't let my drafts expire

491
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,840
because there's quite a lot there that's

492
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,200
changed and that's going on at the

493
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,520
moment and uh i just wanted to to make

494
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,039
that interjection that i would really

495
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,120
support seeing this giving it another

496
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
chance and to make sure that we actually

497
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,960
have a place to discuss

498
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,720
these threats and these threat issues

499
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,240
that are coming up

500
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,320
and let's be honest it's not just about

501
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,159
you know private sector as well there's

502
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,760
a lot going on right now that we really

503
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,919
need to take a look at in terms of

504
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,840
threat bottles so

505
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,200
there's this exciting one we discussed

506
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,880
today it's it's important to have a

507
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
place to discuss this with community but

508
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,080
that is not what we're doing in the

509
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,520
program in the program we're a small

510
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,120
group of people discussing it and we are

511
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,840
failing to bring this to the community

512
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
so we need a different way to do it and

513
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,399
it might not be an iab program

514
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,280
uh rob wilson cisco so just a quick

515
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,120
comment on your workshop on the network

516
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
management which i think is great um but

517
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,559
when advertising that you might

518
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,640
emphasize network monitoring and

519
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,120
operations more than network management

520
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,880
in a sense because otherwise you may

521
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,799
find that network management itself

522
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,720
isn't affected by this and actually it's

523
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
monitoring the traffic so just be clear

524
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,919
when it's being advertised to to pull in

525
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:20,960
the right people and make sure people

526
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,360
understand what's coming

527
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,880
you had a workshop on environmental

528
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,080
impact

529
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,840
on

530
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,600
whatever we do

531
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,760
does this include energy management and

532
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,640
sustainability

533
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,120
yari behind you can answer this question

534
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,360
what the person behind you can answer

535
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,600
this question

536
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:58,720
um

537
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,600
yeah so so the the um the workshop on uh

538
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,320
environmental impacts uh

539
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,480
it's under preparation we expect that to

540
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,960
be a virtual workshop in in december and

541
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
so everybody should be easily able to

542
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,559
participate

543
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,559
uh you'll be needing to submit the

544
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,799
position paper and uh

545
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,080
you know

546
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,840
submissions that are interesting from

547
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,280
from the point of view of the program

548
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,679
chromatin will uh will be accepted and

549
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,720
we'll have a discussion

550
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,440
yes it does include energy management

551
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,840
and sustainability

552
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,600
all right and i'm gonna cut the cue

553
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,159
after yari here go ahead yari yes i just

554
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,400
wanted to come to the mic and and say a

555
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
few words about uh model t so

556
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,360
i i don't claim that i have all the

557
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,000
answers like i mean i share the pain

558
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,320
that was expressed on the mic previously

559
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,679
um but um i i i i probably would have

560
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,679
you slightly different words than media

561
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,480
did uh so it's not not necessarily that

562
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,159
we're gonna close this and go away type

563
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,000
of thing it's it's more that you know

564
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,480
that we see some opportunity for uh

565
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,200
moving some documents at least forward

566
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,880
um for instance some of them in in the

567
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,559
iab documents and

568
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,840
um continuing the discussion

569
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,919
architecture discuss lists so

570
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,880
it's um at least for some parts it can

571
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,480
be an opportunity for actually

572
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,640
completing the work rather than

573
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
you know telling people to go away but

574
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,320
there are other parts that that we don't

575
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,840
necessarily have an answer for so we

576
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,600
need to work on that and we will be

577
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,039
discussing one of the documents by the

578
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,200
way today later

579
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,000
yeah particularly um for documents that

580
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,679
we want to move forward in the iab

581
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,799
document we are looking for

582
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,480
recommendations for the community right

583
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,919
so this is the part

584
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,679
um that makes most sense on the iap

585
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,960
stream

586
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,720
scott i think you have to be very brief

587
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
because i will

588
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,360
yes i will be as brief as i possibly can

589
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,400
and still transfer some information so

590
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,559
greetings everyone i'm the scott

591
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,520
mansfield from erickson i am the itu-t

592
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,120
liaison

593
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,720
manager between the ietf and the itu-t

594
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,080
and also from the itu-t to the ietf so i

595
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,320
tend to write liaisons to myself quite a

596
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,600
lot

597
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,960
so what i've provided here and this is a

598
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
presentation that's up on the website so

599
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,799
i'm not going to read every word on this

600
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,400
slide people can read

601
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,320
i just want to point out a few things if

602
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,080
there's particular information that

603
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,760
you're looking for

604
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,520
and then i'm here all week so if you

605
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,480
need to

606
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
discuss anything in here

607
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,720
a little bit more in depth just contact

608
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,240
me send me an email it's

609
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,520
scott.mansfield.erickson.com very easy

610
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,039
so

611
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,039
there are many things that we deal with

612
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,360
when we're talking between the itu-t and

613
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,799
the ietf

614
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,640
and so there's technical impact things

615
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,320
there's policy impact things there's

616
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,640
geopolitical impact things

617
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,159
so depending on what you're really

618
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,440
interested in

619
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,039
take a look at those things and then

620
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,559
decide if there's anything that you

621
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,400
might want to uh want to talk to me

622
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,360
about

623
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,080
for instance the itu-t focus there's

624
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,240
some topics there they they tend the

625
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
itu-t if you don't know

626
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,159
part of the itu

627
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,320
part of the un they like to look at

628
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,640
things from the top down so they always

629
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,120
have whatever the latest buzzword is

630
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,720
there's going to be a quantum thing or a

631
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,640
digital twin thing or whatever but what

632
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,200
that means to the itu

633
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,559
is different than what that kind of

634
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,960
thing means to the ietf so it's

635
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,640
important to keep that in context so you

636
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,880
go to the next slide so when i but i

637
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,720
provided in here

638
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,400
and there's even more now there was even

639
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,320
a couple more liaisons that came in this

640
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,919
morning even after i sent you this

641
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,840
particular version of it but

642
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,320
go to the the liaison tracker

643
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,640
that the online thing and you can see

644
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
all of them you can sort and so there

645
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,039
are several uh liaisons that we've

646
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,640
received a lot of them are for

647
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,440
information some of them are for action

648
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,840
i chair a joint collaboration activity

649
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,159
on imt 2020

650
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,799
and that liaison just came in this

651
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,159
morning so

652
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,159
if there's any group that has work that

653
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,440
they're doing

654
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,320
associated with 5g or the transport of

655
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,440
5g

656
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,960
those are the types of things that we

657
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,880
would like you to send back to the itu

658
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,720
so we can keep a database of all the

659
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
work that's going on

660
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,080
mainly so that we can avoid duplication

661
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,200
of work if the itu-t knows that work is

662
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,960
going on in a particular area they don't

663
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
have to start it all over again right

664
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,200
so go to the next slide

665
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,960
just real quick so there's another

666
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,360
slider liaisons

667
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,120
there is uh actually this isn't the

668
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,399
newest well that's fine

669
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,559
so there's a whole bunch of drafts on

670
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,960
trust in quantum so if you like trust if

671
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,480
you like quantum

672
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,600
the itu-t study group 13 meeting just

673
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,919
happened the two the first two weeks of

674
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,039
july

675
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,720
they produced quite a bit of work these

676
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,399
are some recent drafts so the next slide

677
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,399
i'm going to do this and then so the

678
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,880
activities there are joint collaboration

679
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,799
activities and focus groups and

680
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,000
correspondence groups and road map style

681
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,440
work so if you don't know what those

682
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,960
things are you can come and talk to me

683
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,520
but the groups that are very active in

684
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,760
study group 13 right now are identity

685
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,880
management autonomous networks

686
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,080
machine

687
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,200
learning data sets this is a new

688
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,600
correspondence group that's been created

689
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,520
so that you can discuss

690
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,880
how to how to standardize the transfer

691
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,799
of data set information when you're

692
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,960
dealing with machine learning

693
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
next slide

694
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,919
whole slew of new workouts and i chart

695
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,720
this is just study group 13. there are

696
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,080
11 study groups in itu-t there's a lot

697
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,159
to look at this is the newest work in

698
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,919
study group 13.

699
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,880
study group 20 is going on this week in

700
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,960
a couple weeks study group 17 which is

701
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
security is going on and then study

702
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,120
group 15 which is transport related is

703
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,799
going on in september lots of stuff

704
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,720
going on you can see that

705
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,320
these are the joint collaboration

706
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,679
agreement

707
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,440
links if you're interested in any of

708

these you can click on them and see what

709
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,240
their latest work is next slide

710
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
this is the information about quantum

711
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,399
information technology for networks

712
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,080
these are the deliverables that they've

713
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,840
already sent out so if you're interested

714
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,120
in that you might want to take a look at

715
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,200
that next

716
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,840
now from a geopolitical standpoint and

717
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,679
from an organization standpoint from

718
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,399
itu-t there are some humongous meetings

719
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,799
that have been going on because of covid

720
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,399
these meetings were supposed to take

721
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,279
place in 2020 and 2021

722
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,000
and 2022 well the meeting that was

723
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,919
supposed to take place in 2020 happened

724
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,919
a couple weeks a couple months ago and

725
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,480
it was called wtsa this is the one that

726
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,240
organizes the work for the itu-t

727
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
and so there's some hot topics there

728
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
what happened and some of the stuff that

729
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,919
that occurred if you're interested in

730
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,840
the resolutions or opinions or any of

731
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,360
the proceedings you can click on and

732
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,399
look at it there go to the next slide

733
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,960
wtdc was supposed to take place last

734
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,000
year

735
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,559
these are the things that uh came were

736
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,279
the hottest topics of discussion and

737
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,320
debate during the wtdc wtdc is for

738
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,880
itu-d

739
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,679
it's the development sector it's to help

740
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,840
connectivity across the world so you can

741
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,640
see

742
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,240
what happened there go next

743
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,399
upcoming is the plenty potentiary

744
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,120
meeting sounds very heavyweight

745
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
actually what it is it's the one that

746
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,600
elects the new secretary general of the

747
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,120
itu

748
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,360
so this is a big deal this meeting

749
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,279
happens it's three weeks it's in

750
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,559
budapest

751
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,200
no bucharest sorry

752
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,320
and the topics of this are

753
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,399
internet governance is a huge topic if

754
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,320
you care about policy if you want to see

755
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,480
what some of the stuff going on

756
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,799
in the world you can look at that link

757
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,200
there's uh the aai is going to be a big

758
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,679
topic things about openran and open

759
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,600
standards and open

760
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,640
stuff

761
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,399
there'll be more discussions about that

762
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,840
in high level res

763
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,880
high level uh resolutions coming down

764
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,360
the important thing that may be lost on

765
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,600
some people is the plenty potentially is

766
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,440
a treaty binding

767
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,480
meeting

768
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,919
which means

769
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,760
laws can come out of this thing it's

770
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,360
something that matters to a member

771
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,559
states so if you go to the next

772
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,799
um upcoming meetings that i've already

773
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,080
said those that's it

774
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,159
yep

775
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,559
thank you yeah look at the slides if you

776
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,720
have any uh questions follow the link or

777
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,320
talk to scott i think that's the easiest

778
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
way

779
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
so we're going to have a talk from yari

780
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,360
about data

781
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,840
minimization uh given that we're running

782
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,440
a little bit behind on the schedule

783
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,279
we're going to ask you to take questions

784
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,440
on this talk to the list and we're not

785
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,600
going to do them live right now

786
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,679
and i'd like to remember folks to please

787
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,600
wear their masks properly over their

788
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,720
nose and mouth in the session except

789
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,200
here right literally not here like your

790
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,080
exception um thank you so i'll try to be

791
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,480
brief um there's more to discuss but uh

792
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,640
let's let's do that on the list so this

793
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,399
is one of the drafts that has been

794
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,399
inspired by the model t work by the way

795
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,000
and there's there's more but this this

796
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,159
is one that we're discussing today um

797
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,600
and i actually believe that this is you

798
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,679
know potentially useful for for the iat

799
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,000
to adopt us as an iep document

800
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
eventually in rfc

801
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,000
um and that's why it's sort of i'm

802
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,720
asking that iab to adapt it and

803
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,440
talking about it here next slide please

804
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,519
so the context for this is that um the

805
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,080
iab typically doesn't like deal with

806
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,919
detailed protocol

807
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,240
issues it deals with you know broader

808
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,000
topics like trends in the internet or

809
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
some high level guidance for instance

810
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,360
rfc 8546 which talks about protocol wire

811
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,880
images and how they

812
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,640
eventually get used if you have any

813
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,240
information that somebody will end up

814
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,919
using it

815
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:54,799
and

816
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,559
our question was in the model t if

817
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,919
there's any guidance to give with

818
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,799
respect to data we share about users and

819
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,120
of course increased encryption will make

820
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,960
less parties

821
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,360
uh uh private to the information about

822
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,480
users

823
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,799
because you you know you encrypt

824
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,120
information flows but but you still

825
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,480
provide a lot of information to various

826
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,360
servers and services and maybe that's

827
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,039
too much and these services can also

828
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,960
share the information further either by

829
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,640
accident or through commercial uh

830
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,559
reasons what can we say about this

831
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,919
it's a hard problem but maybe there are

832
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,799
some things to say next slide please

833
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,480
so we came up with this

834
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,159
simple thing it's just called the data

835
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,880
minimization principle and we're trying

836
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,960
to use the principle of least privilege

837
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,480
and sort of set it in the protocol

838
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,679
context

839
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,679
um just reading out allowed that

840
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,279
political participants should minimize

841
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,120
the information they share for instance

842
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,240
they should

843
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,080
provide only the information to each

844
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,159
other that is necessary for the function

845
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,840
that they expect

846
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,480
to be performed by the other party

847
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,559
um and if they if they say more

848
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,240
information than that then basically

849
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,880
this wire image thing applies that

850
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,720
you know information will get used even

851
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
at the servers even if you encrypted the

852
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,320
whole you know tcp flow or or quick flow

853
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
um so it's really simple but perhaps it

854
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,679
needs to be said given that we are

855
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,560
sharing so much data the next slide

856
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,800
so you may ask how does it actually get

857
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,679
translated to real technical works three

858
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,520
examples and there's probably more we

859
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,440
can think of new new places to apply

860
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,480
this

861
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,520
oblivious dns oblivious https

862
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,440
um basically about giving full

863
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,599
information to any single participant so

864
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,679
that that's the clue there

865
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,599
privacy preserving measurements the ppm

866
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,719
working group

867
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,040
avoid giving a single user's data to any

868
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,800
party but still be able to provide

869
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,199
aggregate statistics for instance and

870
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:45,918
then

871
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,679
end-to-end message encryption between

872
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,119
users

873
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,679
so that you may use some relays servers

874
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,440
that relay information but you don't

875
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,879
tell the servers

876
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,879
the content of the messages

877
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,880
um but that's the destination where they

878
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
won't want to be relayed so pretty

879
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
simple stuff but but actually important

880
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
because we are sharing way too much

881
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,520
information in the internet today

882
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,040
so that's it and we're out of time

883
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
awesome thank you so much gary uh and so

884
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,680
if anyone has comments or questions

885
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,839
please send them on architecture on the

886
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,359
architecture discuss mailing list

887
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,440
all right

888
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,280
dr cabral thanks so much for coming over

889
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,440
to give an invited talk the floor is

890
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,839
yours

891
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,359
yeah so we we invited um dr cabral

892
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,760
uh he is a professor of economics and

893
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,839
international business at the university

894
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,440
of new york so it was a short drive but

895
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,960
it was quite spontaneously so like

896
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,920
really

897
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,800
here

898
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,520
um and we invited you because of the eu

899
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,320
digital market act which was just uh

900
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,960
finished i think right very recently

901
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,160
and this already triggered some

902
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,640
discussion in the itf there was the mimi

903
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,040
barb off yesterday evening and there was

904
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,560
a lot of discussion there already and so

905
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,000
we are really happy to have you here as

906
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,160
an expert and i can just encourage

907
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,040
everybody to take the opportunity to ask

908
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,720
any questions they have now during the

909
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
session is i mean we have 25 minutes

910
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,160
left so let's see how far we get but

911
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,359
also after the session you will be

912
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,000
around for a little bit longer so yeah

913
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,920
thanks thank you for having me and and

914
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,720
i'll try to be brief so again i was next

915
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,560
slide if you could move i was going to

916
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,000
just very briefly introduce myself

917
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,960
because i i'm not by any means an expert

918
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
in internet infrastructure so to be very

919
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,359
clear my area of expertise is the study

920
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,599
of competition policy

921
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,079
and there's a lot of it on over the

922
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,520
internet and so there are a lot of

923
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,720
things that may be relevant for you

924
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,800
that's the reason primarily i'm here in

925
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,920
particular i uh co-wrote a report to the

926
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,839
european union in preparation of the

927
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,800
digital markets act which was approved

928
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
monday of last week so this is all very

929
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,680
fresh

930
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,079
so next slide please

931
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,079
i'm sorry if i'm starting from the zero

932
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,320
but basically as i said i i don't know

933
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,839
anything about infrastructure and i'm

934
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,839
primarily talking about

935
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,240
commerce over the internet so issues of

936
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,480
ip of competition and so forth those are

937
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,400
the issues that i deal with and those

938
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
are the issues that the digital markets

939
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
act and also the digital services act

940
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,640
which is the next one that's coming up

941
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,200
address and which i think are relevant

942
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,560
also for people dealing with

943
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,119
infrastructure so next slide please

944
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,760
um now being so ignorant of issues of

945
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,920
instruction i decided it might not be a

946
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,760
bad idea for me

947
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,079
not to assume any knowledge on your part

948
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,400
on issues of competition policies so i

949
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,800
apologize if i'm stating the obvious to

950
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,480
some of you but i'm going to start with

951
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,200
you know antitrust 101 uh what is this

952
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,520
all about um by the way if you're not in

953
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,200
north america this is usually known as

954
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
competition policy but it's essentially

955
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,320
the same thing see you know a set of uh

956
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,119
institutions and laws that govern the

957
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,000
way

958
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,119
um commerce is done not just on internet

959
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,240
but more generally okay um

960
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
some key players might be the antitrust

961
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,000
division of the u.s department of

962
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,480
justice or in europe dg comp the

963
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,400
directorate of competition which is

964
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,320
probably the most powerful directorate

965
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
in the european union and then there's a

966
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
whole set of of laws

967
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,599
one thing that's a bit peculiar of

968
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,000
competition policy and this may sound a

969
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,760
little strange to you

970
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,280
and if it does it is because it's

971
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,000
strange it's jurisdiction

972
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,440
so um

973
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,640
strictly speak in practice i should say

974
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,200
every competition authority in any

975
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,440
country in the world has jurisdiction

976
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,880
over pretty much every firm in the world

977
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,520
it sounds a little strange but it's true

978
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,440
so just a few months ago the united

979
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,119
kingdom blocked the acquisition

980
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,920
of giphy by meta so we have an

981
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,160
acquisition of two american firms and

982
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,400
that acquisition was blocked by a united

983
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
kingdom regulator

984
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,079
how come how did he find that

985
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,160
jurisdiction well to the extent that

986
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,160
meta and gif you want to do business in

987
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,520
the uk

988
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,800
they have to follow their rules they

989
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,960
decide you cannot do that acquisition

990
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,320
and they cannot afford not to do

991
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,240
business in the united kingdom

992
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,800
then they have to follow

993
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,880
whatever is imposed on them so this is

994
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,960
so much it's very different from refined

995
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,320
in these meetings and

996
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,400
because it's not so much about

997
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,040
uh global cooperation it's it's a very

998
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,560
fragmented

999
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,720
next slide please

1000
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,040
um just again

1001
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,320
three minutes for those of you are not

1002
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,400
aware of um competition policy has

1003
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,160
evolved a lot in the past 30 years in

1004
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,599
particular one thing that we've noticed

1005
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,400
is what uh my uh colleague thomas bond

1006
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,480
refers to as the great reversal it used

1007
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,599
to be primarily a u.s based tradition of

1008
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,839
being very tough on how firms compete

1009
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,839
and so forth whereas europe did not have

1010
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,599
a lot of that and in past 30 years there

1011
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,760
was a complete reversal between the two

1012
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,599
sides of the of the atlantic and now

1013
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,040
it's the european union that's been

1014
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,760
really the leader in trying to enforce

1015
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,599
rules for a level play field in in

1016
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,280
commerce in general and in particular on

1017
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,359
internet and and i think this is

1018
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,800
particularly important when it comes to

1019
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,280
digital markets and that survey when i

1020
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,839
finally i'm coming to next slide please

1021
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,359
my point uh which is the digital markets

1022
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,240
act

1023
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,160
this is all very fresh as i said it was

1024
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,200
approved on monday of last week so

1025
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,760
we're just living through it right now

1026
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,920
and and

1027
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,280
the goal is to restore some level of

1028
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,640
competition

1029
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,359
in uh digital markets and what i mean by

1030
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,359
that is you know the usual suspects

1031
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,040
google and apple and amazon microsoft

1032
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,240
meta

1033
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
and then maybe other smaller platforms

1034
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,319
which are referred to in dma as the

1035
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,839
gatekeepers

1036
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,119
and i think

1037
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,880
if i had to divide the structure of the

1038
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,720
dma i would say there are three parts

1039
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,319
that are important to it one is defining

1040
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,000
who are these gatekeepers because we are

1041
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,680
first to say who are they we're going to

1042
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,880
be regulated second the list of do's and

1043
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,800
don'ts and i want to talk a little bit

1044
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,040
about that and finally how does this

1045
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,800
work in practice how do you implement

1046
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
this uh one thing is to have a law in

1047
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,160
theory the other thing is how this is

1048
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,920
going to work in practice so what i want

1049
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,240
to do in the next uh three slides or so

1050
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,200
is to go over uh these uh uh different

1051
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,880
parts in greater detail

1052
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,160
so gatekeepers um

1053
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,599
there's a bunch of articles that you

1054
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,240
find that um and i'm just giving you

1055
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,920
just a little bit of the tip of the

1056
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,560
iceberg it's basically you know it's

1057
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,680
basically

1058
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,920
as i said the usual suspects and

1059
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,520
basically come up with rules that would

1060
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,000
essentially include them so you have to

1061
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,040
be large you have to be uh

1062
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,440
entrenched power you mean in other words

1063
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,599
have dominated the market for quite some

1064
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,480
time

1065
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,119
um and you have to have a a core

1066
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,240
platform service so it could be a the

1067
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,040
google search engine could be uh um

1068
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,240
uh social uh networks on facebook and so

1069
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,839
forth um

1070
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,520
and there's an article article 15 one

1071
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,800
that says that the commissioned european

1072
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,040
commission will

1073
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,880
conduct market investigation to decide

1074
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,359
whether a certain corporation should be

1075
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,359
or should not be included as a

1076
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,920
gatekeeper and therefore subject to the

1077
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,280
regulations in the dma next slide please

1078
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
and the core of the dma and this is

1079
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,440
probably what you should uh probably pay

1080
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,839
attention to um

1081
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,079
everyone should be is chapter three

1082
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,960
which is the list of do's and don'ts

1083
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,079
um

1084
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,599
let me just say that i mean if you ask

1085
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,440
me does this have the potential for

1086
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,119
being a big deal

1087
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,200
and my answer is no this is the

1088
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,599
potential being a humongous deal i mean

1089
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,760
this really could be a watershed moment

1090
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,200
in the history of the internet maybe i'm

1091
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,960
exaggerating and perhaps of course you

1092
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,319
guys have a different perspective which

1093
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,640
is infrastructure but in terms of the

1094
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,440
history of how google and microsoft and

1095
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
and facebook and so forth

1096
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,359
have been doing business i i feel i

1097
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,760
think could change radically in the next

1098
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,000
few years if this is really implemented

1099
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,040
okay so uh it's articles five and six

1100
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,480
there's a typewriter in there they

1101
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,839
basically have

1102
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,359
if i were to summarize article five

1103
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,800
things that you really have to do or

1104
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,960
cannot do and then things that

1105
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,359
maybe upon further investigation we may

1106
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,680
tell you not to do and and let me know

1107
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,520
in the next slide please give you some

1108
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,280
examples of what those things might be

1109
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,079
just to give an idea how

1110
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,280
revolutionary this could be if this is

1111
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,760
actually implemented

1112
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,000
no self-preferencing in ranking and in

1113
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,119
indexing

1114
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,760
so for example i mean of course

1115
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,920
there's allegations we don't know that

1116
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,640
amazon would favor its own products in

1117
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,560
listing them on on the page

1118
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,800
or that google there is some

1119
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,960
evidence of that would

1120
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,280
bring some of the

1121
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,839
affiliated services up on the organic

1122
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,000
search pages and so forth

1123
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,880
that's

1124
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,119
in the blacklist

1125
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,880
okay

1126
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,680
second huge this one friend which is the

1127
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,800
idea a legal term for um

1128
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,680
fair

1129
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,599
and non-discriminatory

1130
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,200
uh fair and non-discriminatory access to

1131
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,640
click and query data this is huge

1132
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,480
basically saying that google has has to

1133
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,040
provide click and query data or amazon

1134
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,880
whatever to third parties at a

1135
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,720
reasonable price of course what does

1136
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,160
reasonable mean you know i don't know

1137
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,800
this for lawyers to decide largely but i

1138
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,599
mean

1139
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,280
never like this is an important very

1140
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,160
important step

1141
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,280
interoperability there's

1142
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,880
a lot of instances where things will be

1143
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,560
important one of them that's dealt with

1144
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,760
in dma is for for example for messaging

1145
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,119
services

1146
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,000
so i may if i have a new the cabral

1147
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,119
messenger i may ask facebook to allow me

1148
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,280
to uh

1149
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,599
integrate it with their own messenger

1150
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,800
now of course the devil is going to be

1151
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,160
in the details how that's going to be

1152
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,319
done but at least the idea is is that

1153
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,160
that is this should be uh

1154
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,920
important same thing for app stores

1155
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,640
which are basically a huge monopoly by

1156
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,280
apple and google right now

1157
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
uh no restrictions on transactions off

1158
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,640
the platform this is getting a little

1159
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,040
technical but for example amazon does

1160
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,119
not allow uh sellers who sell through

1161
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,640
amazon uh to set a lower price elsewhere

1162
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,560
sounds a little crazy it is crazy but

1163
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,400
but it is true it's one thing that they

1164
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,000
ask um

1165
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,560
and then data portability if i create

1166
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,760
now a cabral uh selling network i can

1167
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,119
tell um

1168
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,000
um

1169
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,319
amazon that if if amir for example she

1170
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,480
had an account on amazon

1171
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,119
i want amazon to give me that data of

1172
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,520
her past purchases so that she can have

1173
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
all of that you know recommendations

1174
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,400
that uh uh she had on amazon i can have

1175
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,280
on my own cabral platform again

1176
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,319
um

1177
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,240
no precedence of of

1178
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,520
regulations of of this strength uh i i

1179
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,640
don't think in the history of the

1180
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,400
internet and that's what the dma is

1181
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,440
asking for

1182
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,680
um and finally uh notification

1183
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,440
acquisitions since 2000 uh gatham the

1184
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,640
five top firms have made close to 1 000

1185
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,960
acquisitions and only one was blocked

1186
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,280
that was last year and it was giphy the

1187
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,760
acquisition of giphy by mata so these

1188
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,400
are just some of the items that are

1189
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,480
covered in the lists of do's and don'ts

1190
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,119
that just went into effect on monday of

1191
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,839
last week and as i said i mean if this

1192
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,960
is applied this is really a what a shed

1193
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,520
in the history of of of the internet as

1194
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,400
far as i can tell next slide please

1195
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,680
so um

1196
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,839
non-compliance again this is huge the

1197
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,960
commission has the rights of uh article

1198
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,560
21.1 of conduct on-site inspections i

1199
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,599
mean i think it's pretty draconic but

1200
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,280
it's written today i i still don't know

1201
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,040
exactly how to interpret that but i i'm

1202
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,720
interpreting the way it's in there that

1203
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,960
i can just walk in here affirmative and

1204
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,800
and ask you for the data for your emails

1205
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,000
for everything

1206
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,200
um

1207
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,040
and basically you know this basically

1208
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,520
just implementation in a decade finds up

1209
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,680
to 10 of turnover this may not seem like

1210
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,800
a lot but

1211
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,119
it is a lot

1212
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,520
i mean it could be i don't know into

1213
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,000
tens of billions of dollars of fines

1214
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,280
so that potentially this could be it

1215
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,240
could be big next slide please

1216
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,760
and so it's on as of last week

1217
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,920
okay um

1218
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,440
i think this has a potential of being

1219
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,720
huge

1220
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,000
but of course the devil is in the

1221
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,040
details

1222
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,559
how's this going to work

1223
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,400
and i think one very important

1224
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,760
difference in respect to the past in the

1225
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,000
past competition policy has been left to

1226
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,119
lawyers

1227
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,280
and some economists

1228
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,520
and i think one of the reasons why this

1229
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,359
is very revolutionary this is going to

1230
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,920
create an enormous demand for people

1231
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,280
like you

1232
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,440
because i mean how on earth can the

1233
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,079
european commission know that amazon uh

1234
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,200
is giving preferences no i need to uh

1235
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,520
have ways of of um

1236
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,200
i don't know finding out whether they

1237
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,960
are

1238
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,440
giving access

1239
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,599
interoperability whether they are

1240
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,680
actually sharing the right data

1241
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,520
and so forth i mean there are so many

1242
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,119
ways of of not following the rules and

1243
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,720
this is not something that a lawyer can

1244
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,559
figure out this is something that will

1245
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,760
require a lot of expertise and and this

1246
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,200
to me is the biggest problem the

1247
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,520
commission has very limited staff and in

1248
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,640
particular very limited technical staff

1249
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,319
and i think this will be the biggest

1250
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,680
challenge to see whether they can

1251
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,079
actually face up to the big giants and

1252
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,960
and force them to to uh to to

1253
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,480
apply the rules that are being defined

1254
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,200
by the dma so we'll see in the next few

1255
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,720
years and let me just say that in

1256
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,720
addition to dma another big thing that's

1257
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,440
coming out is the digital services act

1258
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,760
and that covers issues like liability

1259
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,480
free speech uh and things of that sort

1260
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,319
so non-technical issues but nevertheless

1261
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,400
very important issues by large digital

1262
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,520
corporations and i think like i said

1263
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,200
um

1264
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,319
i think it's great that the european

1265
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,319
union is taking the lead on that uh

1266
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,079
traditionally the u.s was really the

1267
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,040
country where competition rules were

1268
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,880
more enforced and more likely enforced

1269
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,319
but in the past few years things have

1270
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,480
kind of been reversed uh regulators in

1271
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,440
us

1272
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,200
have essentially been asleep when it

1273
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,920
comes to antitrust and so it's probably

1274
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,440
a good thing that european union is

1275
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,119
taking on that role

1276
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,240
so uh thank you and i'll be happy either

1277
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,160
now or later on perhaps uh can stay here

1278
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,000
for a little longer and answer answer

1279
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,319
questions you might have about the dma

1280
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,400
again thanks for having me

1281
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,040
thank you so much can we no actually we

1282
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,640
have questions so stay here don't run

1283
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,880
away

1284
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,839
so

1285
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,400
let's see wes kick us off

1286
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
thank you very much very interesting uh

1287
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,760
talk

1288
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,440
and i hope you know that it actually

1289
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,040
comes true to some extent that it

1290
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,319
promotes interoperability at layers uh

1291
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,920
higher than we we typically see in the

1292
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,760
ietf these days you know everybody wants

1293
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,000
wild guard and log lock-ins and you know

1294
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,640
they use base http and tcp and the

1295
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,559
layers that we know about and then it

1296
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:55,839
sort of stops because they're trying to

1297
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,160
get vendor lock in what i worry about

1298
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,720
and what i'm curious about is

1299
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,559
does the document which i have not read

1300
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,839
i apologize

1301
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,760
uh figure out a way to avoid some of the

1302
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,760
legal loopholes right so you talk about

1303
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,359
you know they want to mandate instant

1304
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,040
messaging right i could very quickly see

1305
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,480
the companies going okay we're no longer

1306
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,079
doing instant messaging we're now doing

1307
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,280
something different

1308
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,559
right so they're always trying to keep

1309
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,880
one step ahead and get you know sort of

1310
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,760
more lock-in uh is there any sort of

1311
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,839
protections of you know that the list is

1312
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,920
not this fixed list that you know will

1313
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,359
is going to be out of date in three

1314
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,280
years so i think you're asking the right

1315
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,119
question and i i i don't have an answer

1316
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,880
i mean the answer is no it doesn't have

1317
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,920
it here

1318
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,280
and there are a lot of loopholes i mean

1319
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,640
one is for example encryption you can

1320
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,480
say that well i'm what's up and you know

1321
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,480
i'm i have this technology for

1322
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,079
encryption and and if you don't have

1323
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,480
that i'm not going to allow you to to

1324
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,480
interoperate with what i'm just giving

1325
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,119
you as a possible example they're

1326
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,960
they're mirrored ways and of course the

1327
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,280
large corporations have a lot more

1328
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,599
technical people who can who can who can

1329
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,160
do those sort of tricks yes i think the

1330
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,319
reason why i i say that the devil is in

1331
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,000
the details whether the commission will

1332
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,160
be able to actually

1333
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,920
implement this in a way that it's

1334
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,079
practical and that prevents all sorts of

1335
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,480
loopholes and and and tricks that the

1336
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,720
large corporations may implement to do

1337
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,160
with that and one of the problems that

1338
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,200
you also point out which i think is

1339
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,160
important

1340
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,599
i mean one possible downside of this

1341
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,200
is that they will just stop offering a

1342
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,720
lot of services i mean if that's how you

1343
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,200
want to do it then i'll stop doing it

1344
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,160
i

1345
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,680
don't think so

1346
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,599
but a lot of people of course i mean the

1347
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:30,880
large corporations are already saying

1348
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,880
that it was part of the lobby by the

1349
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,240
large corporate well if you're going to

1350
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,839
start regulating us like this we're

1351
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,920
going to stop offering search

1352
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,800
on google well come on

1353
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,720
or it's like so i i don't think it's a

1354
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,319
credible thread i'd just like to know

1355
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,440
you really scared me when you said

1356
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,720
companies going to start implementing

1357
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,480
their own encryption algorithms again to

1358
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,160
get around the interoperability problem

1359
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,280
i i'm now quaking

1360
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,480
hey stephen farrell thanks for having

1361
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,040
the talk that was good um so a related

1362
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,680
question is uh

1363
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,400
my related question is how

1364
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,319
so the defining interoperability is

1365
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,559
obviously going to take a while um from

1366
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,720
the kind of regulatory side of it how

1367
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,960
would how how would you see that process

1368
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,359
happening and how long might it take or

1369
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,040
is it just nobody knows yet

1370
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,720
so one thing that i did not mention is

1371
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,280
that the dma does uh include the

1372
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,880
possibility in fact

1373
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,480
suggests that there will be a dialogue

1374
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,079
with the corporations that are

1375
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,760
considered gatekeepers

1376
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,440
so as to implement that i mean i think

1377
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,720
the commission understands that they

1378
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,400
don't understand things and so uh the

1379
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,160
idea is that there will be some sort of

1380
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,040
a dialogue uh

1381
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,880
with the gatekeepers and perhaps some

1382
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,040
interested third parties i mean

1383
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,800
duckduckgo for example they've been

1384
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,440
clamoring for for ages that they want

1385
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,400
access to

1386
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,200
uh indexing and so forth so my guess is

1387
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,280
that the commission will uh call google

1388
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,119
listen we we need to do something about

1389
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,119
this and then it will call duckduckgo as

1390
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,800
well to tell you know you guys are the

1391
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,319
experts tell us exactly what you need

1392
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,359
and and then negotiate that with them so

1393
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,800
dma does not have in detail exactly what

1394
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,440
this means just creates a platform as it

1395
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,920
were for this to be implemented okay

1396
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,760
largely by means of dialogue great

1397
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,119
thanks and as a follow-up i guess i

1398
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,319
presume there's no mention of things

1399
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,800
like the ietf so far in in that in those

1400
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,520
documents um

1401
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,280
you know i don't know it's a good

1402
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,960
question um

1403
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,559
i think there's a mention of third

1404
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,119
parties who will be uh relevant i don't

1405
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,839
know that there's ieipf is mentioned

1406
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,760
specifically

1407
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,520
it should be because a lot of these

1408
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,240
things are going to amount to um

1409
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,680
technical

1410
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,960
interoperability details

1411
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,440
hi phil handbaker great talk i

1412
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,839
you know i appreciate the informed

1413
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,119
discussion of

1414
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,160
this stuff

1415
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,040
uh

1416
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,520
i want to ask about switching costs

1417
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,880
see the thing is at the moment we're

1418
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,000
talking about competition policy and

1419
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,480
company a can fairly compete with

1420
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,920
company b

1421
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,160
i don't care about the companies

1422
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,880
i

1423
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,359
care about alice and bob

1424
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,839
and alice in one world garden can talk

1425
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:08,880
to bob

1426
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,160
in another walk garden is an improvement

1427
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,400
but the real thing for me is

1428
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,800
alice who is in one wall garden

1429
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,520
can get up any time she chooses and move

1430
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,920
to another wall garden of a choice

1431
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,160
without losing all her friends losing

1432
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,280
all the contacts losing etc so is there

1433
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,480
any sign of that sort of movement uh

1434
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,400
coming on to the agenda yet

1435
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,400
so i think that's the right the right

1436
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,920
question and i think that's one of the

1437
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,559
areas where the dma is very specific now

1438
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,240
what they can get it is a different

1439
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,200
story

1440
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,079
but i mentioned the example of

1441
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,559
i have my amazon account and and suppose

1442
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,440
there's another platform that has

1443
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,160
amazon is obliged to provide the third

1444
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,119
party

1445
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,960
all of the search information that he

1446
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,880
used of me all the information they have

1447
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,720
about me that would allow the third

1448
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,400
party to provide exactly the same

1449
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,760
quality of service in terms of

1450
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,520
recommender systems

1451
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,359
that's the law

1452
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,799
again the devil's in the details i mean

1453
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,400
i i can think of a hundred ways that

1454
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,799
amazon could could could uh um you know

1455
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,040
screw things up for the third party uh

1456
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,040
and that's where i believe

1457
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,640
technical support is going to be so so

1458
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,160
important you know lawyers are not going

1459
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,760
to be able to do this

1460
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,040
or economists for that matter

1461
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,079
alyssa cooper thank you for this talk

1462
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,440
it's very helpful

1463
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,520
um i have two questions my first

1464
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,359
question is

1465
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,240
about interoperability so there's

1466
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,920
obviously like many different ways that

1467
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,760
you can achieve interoperability and

1468
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,720
standards are just one of those um

1469
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,440
and so i'm curious whether

1470
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,119
there's a sense

1471
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,880
that you have from your perspective

1472
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,400
about whether the european commission

1473
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,240
has preferences about how this

1474
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,480
interoperability is achieved obviously

1475
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,680
in this venue we like standards a lot

1476
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,440
and we like to do things on an internet

1477
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,480
scale

1478
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,920
so a sort of

1479
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,920
one-to-one dialogue you know with each

1480
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,680
gatekeeper where they negotiate

1481
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,119
bilaterally how they're going to achieve

1482
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,760
this interoperability is sub-optimal

1483
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,440
from our perspective

1484
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,799
and you list it out i mean there's a

1485
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,040
number of areas where interoperability

1486
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,119
appears to be a goal it's very explicit

1487
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,480
with respect to messaging voice and

1488
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,000
video but there's lots of other ones in

1489
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,680
there around the data sharing and the

1490
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,319
ads ecosystem and search and all of that

1491
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,720
so i'm just curious if uh if you if you

1492
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,640
can glean whether they actually would

1493
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,480
prefer to see standardized solutions to

1494
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,680
some of these things or whether they're

1495
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,200
kind of indifferent

1496
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,680
um and then the sort of flip side of

1497
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,680
that second question is

1498
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,799
there's

1499
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,440
my understanding of other pieces of um

1500
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,040
european union legislation where they're

1501
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,400
much more explicit about the

1502
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,000
standardization requirements where they

1503
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,400
actually you know detail them and then

1504
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,799
um and then you know delegate them to

1505
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,359
the european um standards organizations

1506
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,000
or for like in the the data act where

1507
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,559
they talk in cloud switching about um

1508
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,119
the need for standards or interfaces and

1509
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,880
it's much more explicit at least in my

1510
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,119
reading than it is in the dma and so i'm

1511
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,720
wondering if that's meaningful like the

1512
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,720
fact that there is no explicit language

1513
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,240
in there about standardization whether

1514
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,920
we should read something into that as

1515
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,400
far as um you know whether it was put to

1516
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,599
the side

1517
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,680
because it was not viewed as a viable

1518
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,760
option um or if that was just part of

1519
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,400
the political process right uh two very

1520
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,400
good questions i mean i'm probably going

1521
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,480
to read myself a little bit in here but

1522
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,000
the dma

1523
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,280
was

1524
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,440
created by a bunch of politicians

1525
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,920
lawyers and economists who know nothing

1526
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,160
about technical details it was largely

1527
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,400
an exercise in reverse engineering say

1528
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,240
here are some problems that we have

1529
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,599
we have to deal with apple we have to

1530
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,440
deal with google we have

1531
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,440
what is the law that would

1532
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,079
kind of relate to that and so um in

1533
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,200
answer to your question i don't think

1534
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,640
there are any preferences because they

1535
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,480
have no idea

1536
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,520
pardon

1537
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,640
my

1538
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,040
sincerity now you're on the record i

1539
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,160
have no idea how to do it and honestly i

1540
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,839
i i i really think that this is an error

1541
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,359
where you could make an enormous

1542
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,960
contribution because

1543
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,839
um

1544
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,240
it's the the dma it's a that's a part i

1545
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,839
don't like is a bit of a patchwork of

1546
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,240
things which is clearly guided by the

1547
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,880
problems that people have not by a

1548
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,880
general theory of how it could be but

1549
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,799
ultimately is as one of the previous

1550
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,559
questions said i think the goal is to

1551
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,799
end with closed systems

1552
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,680
the internet right now is a series of

1553
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,599
enclosed gardens

1554
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,079
enclosed systems that do not allow for

1555
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,280
competition

1556
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,799
app stores

1557
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,119
search protocol and so forth and so the

1558
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,520
idea is to to the best that we can try

1559
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,160
to end that

1560
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,760
what's the best technical way of doing

1561
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,079
that i don't know and i think honestly i

1562
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,920
think that the european commission would

1563
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,599
be delighted

1564
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,359
to have iepf or uh ib contributions in

1565
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:58,720
that direction

1566
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,559
and but i also think that probably

1567
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:01,920
depends on

1568
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,359
what type of problem you're talking

1569
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,119
about because you know an app store is

1570
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,799
very different from search which is very

1571
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:07,920
different from

1572
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,040
algorithm

1573
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:09,839
uh

1574
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,359
i mean there are different types of

1575
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,200
problems on the commercial part of the

1576
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,359
internet i don't think there's one size

1577
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,839
fits all in terms of

1578
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,960
regulations thank you thank you

1579
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,079
we have christian next remotely and we

1580
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:25,920
are close to time so christian and

1581
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,079
mallory can you please keep it short and

1582
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,440
i'm cutting the queue after mallory

1583
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,079
thank you for the talk it was very

1584
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,440
interesting and it's interesting to see

1585
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,720
that people are trying to address

1586
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,720
competition issues

1587
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,680
i am a bit scared by

1588
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,680
what you have mentioned about sharing

1589
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,359
data

1590
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,200
i mean you mentioned competition as

1591
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,119
being a big issue in the internet and it

1592
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,400
is

1593
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,000
but there is another big issue which is

1594
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,839
surveillance

1595
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,799
which is the fact that companies are

1596
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,200
acquiring data about you

1597
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,319
to

1598
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,720
either sell products or

1599
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,680
even

1600
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,480
steer you towards particular

1601
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,880
goals behaviors and all that and when

1602
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,400
you say okay

1603
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,200
now

1604
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,680
everybody can negotiate with google or

1605
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,799
amazon

1606
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:24,640
and get all the clicks of their users

1607
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,599
that seems to me like a

1608
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,480
liberalization of surveillance

1609
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,040
in the old days only amazon and google

1610
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,079
and a couple of big guys could do that

1611
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,640
but in this brave new world

1612
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,720
anybody can get all the data all the

1613
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:46,160
time and that doesn't that seems scary

1614
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,599
um

1615
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:48,319
i

1616
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,960
my answer is i agree i i have to agree

1617
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,359
uh i think much of what you're talking

1618
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,760
about right now will probably fall under

1619
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,160
the digital services act which is the uh

1620
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,559
the next uh act as it were that the

1621
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,480
commission is putting which includes

1622
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,480
issues of surveillance issues of

1623
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,200
monitoring free speech issues of

1624
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,720
you know basically uh um

1625
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,839
liability for users actions and and and

1626
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,680
responsibility for the user users

1627
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,000
privacy

1628
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,799
i

1629
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,400
don't know much about the digital

1630
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,960
services act

1631
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,200
but as i said i i think your question

1632
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,200
probably refers more and more to that i

1633
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,119
mean regarding the example that i gave

1634
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,520
of of amazon search data

1635
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,520
you can think of that as

1636
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,200
in the old days of telecommunications

1637
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,799
number portability i mean there's kind

1638
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,960
of similar idea i need to have a system

1639
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,119
whereby it's very easy for me if i want

1640
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,640
to go from a phone company to another

1641
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,319
company i can do it tomorrow at a very

1642
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,839
low cost

1643
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,119
it's the same thing when it comes you

1644
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,480
know if you switch a different browser

1645
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,920
you would like to have a way that all of

1646
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,680
your bookmarks could be transferred very

1647
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,040
easily

1648
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,880
that's the kind of thing that the dma is

1649
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,720
asking for in here is making it easier

1650
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,839
for the user to switch from one system

1651
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,559
to another system and to

1652
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:06,000
impose the obligation on the platform to

1653
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,160
provide that data so this is not a

1654
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,240
violation of privacy this is data that i

1655
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,160
know that amazon has about me and in

1656
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,920
fact i'm glad that amazon has about me

1657
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,960
because they make very good

1658
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,440
recommendations but i'm sick of amazon i

1659
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,799
want to move to

1660
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:21,839
um cabral platform

1661
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,920
and and i want amazon to give the cabral

1662
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,520
platform all of that data so that i can

1663
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,920
have a seamless transfer of of of

1664
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,760
services from one platform to the other

1665
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,599
so i don't think

1666
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,119
here it's so much

1667
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,799
i don't think it's an issue of privacy

1668
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,359
per se it's an issue of

1669
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:38,960
not allowing

1670
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,160
the firms to have

1671
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:48,200
proprietary rights over user level data

1672
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,400
hi everybody uh mallory nodal at the

1673
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,480
center for democracy and technology um

1674
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,559
thanks um professor cabral for coming on

1675
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,319
such short notice it's really good to

1676
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:59,760
have um this discussion here um about

1677
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,839
the impacts um i guess my question is

1678
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:03,839
really straightforward so it's short but

1679
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,240
you know we we've seen the global data

1680
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,720
protection regulation for example gdpr

1681
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,680
um kind of play out for a few years now

1682
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,760
and i think a lot of people would say

1683
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,920
there could be some changes we've got

1684
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,119
notes

1685
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,039
for those regulators and i wonder then

1686
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,079
about the dma as well i suspect that

1687
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,520
because we're already sort of

1688
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,440
anticipating problems that some of those

1689
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,200
problems will play out so what are the

1690
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,400
mechanisms to revise this how long will

1691
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,720
it take does it have to be in the courts

1692
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,880
would the ec be more flexible and

1693
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,039
actually changing this because i believe

1694
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,440
it's a directive not a regulation or

1695
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,920
maybe you could clarify on that and um

1696
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,880
you know what kinds of evidence or

1697
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,760
advocacy would be useful in bringing um

1698
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,720
you know really big red flags to uh the

1699
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,720
commission if it does happen to play out

1700
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,720
in ways that we think it might but

1701
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,880
actually then do correct i mean another

1702
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,359
great question uh yes you're quite right

1703
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,200
in fact the dma does have provisions for

1704
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,280
it to be revised in the next few years i

1705
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,559
mean my guess it'll take probably a

1706
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,920
decade before the dust settles on it um

1707
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,799
and and i mean any interested party can

1708
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:14,160
can can contribute to it uh so so uh i

1709
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,599
mean in that regards i mean i i think

1710
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:16,880
it's a good attitude that european

1711
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
commission have which is one of

1712
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,480
willingness to learn and willingness to

1713
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,720
adapt as time goes by

1714
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,000
i have to say that data point that he

1715
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,359
raised which i think is a very important

1716
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,599
point is

1717
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:28,960
i mean there are risks there are

1718
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,799
enormous risks the egdpr one risk was

1719
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,240
and there's some evidence already that

1720
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,760
economists have been studying that this

1721
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,839
had a very negative impact on small

1722
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:42,640
startups because uh you know if um

1723
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,240
cookies i mean information about

1724
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,280
consumer data is what what made many of

1725
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,240
these startups survive and thrive and if

1726
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,160
all of a sudden you cannot do that it

1727
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,920
creates an enormous bear to enter for

1728
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,760
new startups so

1729
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,039
clearly there are risks i mean for

1730
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,640
example in the u.s i don't know if

1731
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,000
you're aware of that but one of the

1732
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,640
proposals uh senator warren and other

1733
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,640
people have been posing is to have a

1734
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,000
complete

1735
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,440
moratorium or complete uh

1736
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,240
prohibition of acquisitions of startups

1737
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,480
by large corporations like i said it's

1738
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,200
been about a thousand since 2000

1739
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,440
i think that would be disastrous if you

1740
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,280
ask me because it's an entire ecosystem

1741
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,000
that would disappear overnight

1742
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,079
so

1743
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,680
it's important to take into account the

1744
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,799
risks that such draconian policies have

1745
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,240
and i think that's one of the reasons

1746
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,119
why this is not set in stone i mean i

1747
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:37,200
was probably dramatizing it a little too

1748
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,920
much the document was approved last

1749
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,599
i think it was an important moment

1750
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:44,240
monday of last week but this is by no

1751
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,160
means the end of the story it will take

1752
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,079
probably a decade until things settle

1753
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:49,680
down and there will be a lot of dialogue

1754
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,359
with all the interested parties and a

1755
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,280
lot of adjustment in india various

1756
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,119
articles of the dma but it's a good

1757
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,799
start i think it's an important start

1758
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:02,000
all right thank you so much we're sorry

1759
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,680
for running a little bit over time can i

1760
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,359
ask everyone to join me in a round of

1761
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:06,980
applause for dr cabral

great talk because i've been hearing

1765
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,200
about this so many times and now i feel

1766
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,880
like i understand a little bit more and

1767
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,039
i'm terrified

1768
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,000
um all right this is a wrap of the ib

1769
