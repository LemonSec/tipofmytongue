working group chairs forum i'd like to

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,799

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,000
ought to be discussing

26
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,680

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,560
notewell for the ietf this is an

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,159
official ietf meeting and the notewell

29
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,799
does apply

30
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,680
a few other reminders

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
since we're having lunch

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
you know when you finish eating put your

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,280
masks back on

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,919
but i guess in this particular session

35
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,920
uh masks will need to be off for a

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,399
little while

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,640
we are also going to use the queue we do

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,040
have some remote participants so

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,879
please

40
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,840
please do that

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,239
so this is our agenda for today we have

42
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,040
uh an update from our ombuds team an

43
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
update from our tools team and an update

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,480
on some of the work that has been

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,000
ongoing to help improve some of the

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,480
chairs training and materials uh we will

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,720
have an open mic at the end we do need

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
to end promptly at 12 45 and then we

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,560
will need to quickly clean up and exit

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
the room because other meetings come in

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
after us

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
so with that uh pete

53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
karen this is spencer could i ask you a

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,280
question real quick i think i just

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,319
signed into emo durr with that

56
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,360

57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,440

and we're still working out how we want

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,280
the tooling to work for the various

61
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,080
activities under there

62
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,560

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
through a mask

64
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,959

82
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,439
invited by one ad to

83
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,360
come to speak to a particular working

84
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,280
group that was having some

85
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
uh issues with people sniping at each

86
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,840
other and and you know we're glad to

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,120
even do that in a sort of non-official

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,880
capacity but we wanted to remind you

89
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
more importantly of the division of

90
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,479
labor here

91
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,600
um we are not the behavior police you'll

92
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,000
notice that the way that our

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,360
rfc is written we do everything

94
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,759
behind closed doors

95
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,840
lots of confidentiality

96
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,040
we are not here to

97
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
get up at the mic and say stop doing

98
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,160
that that's not our purpose

99
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,880
shares have the ultimate

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,680
uh responsibility and authority

101
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
in rfc 2418 and bcp 25 generally if you

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,639
haven't read it please do

103
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,000
um to address disruptions in working

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,080
groups you have the ability to

105
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
disallow someone from going to the mic

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
you have the ability in different

107
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,520
circumstances and with different

108
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
mechanisms to stop people from posting

109
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,280
to mailing lists

110
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,400
it is your job to stop behavior that is

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,240
being disruptive to the work of the

112
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,840
working group that's not an ombuds team

113
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,199
responsibility like i said we are

114
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,520
absolutely happy to advise you on how to

115
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
do that

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
and and work you through the process if

117
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,680
you need that help we're all old hands

118
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
at the ietf

119
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
processes

120
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,160
but please do not expect that the answer

121
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,880
to

122
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,199
this person's being a jerk

123
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,360
is oh go talk to the ombuds team about

124
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,479
that

125
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,720
this is something that you all as chairs

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,680
really have to take on

127
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
when it comes to things like harassment

128
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,759
and and by that i mean

129
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,919
you know something more interpersonal

130
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,280
and direct

131
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,680
someone making disparaging comments

132
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,280
about groups

133
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,240
someone doing something off list

134
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
harassing someone behind the scenes that

135
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,680
is something that we want to hear about

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
and please do bring those kinds of

137
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,199
issues to us

138
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,000
but overall if it's happening on the

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
mailing list

140
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
and it's disrupting the working group we

141
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
expect you to take up

142
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
dealing with that

143
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,080
uh if it's something that is more

144
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,360
problematic

145
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
and certainly illegal um come talk to us

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
about that

147
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,840
uh finally please do feel free to reach

148
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,639
out by email to either the ombuds team

149
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,759
address directly or to either any one of

150
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,440
the three of us

151
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,280
um directly

152
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,080
uh the way we generally handle things is

153
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,479
if it comes to the ombuds team address

154
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,160
we'll assign one of the three of us to

155
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,599
deal with it

156
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,240
um so that only one person especially if

157
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
it becomes a true ombuds team issue

158
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
so only one person is dealing with the

159
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,800
confidential information

160
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
and with that i'd just like to open up

161
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
the mic if anybody has any questions or

162
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,120
problems they've encountered glad to

163
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,080
talk about them here

164
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,520
any questions or comments

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,240
somebody dashing to the mic without

166
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,919
putting himself in the queue but that's

167
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,280

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,759
reminding us that

174
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,280
and to the topic of this group i still

175
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,039
don't feel we've done some work in the

176
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,199
past but i don't still feel don't chairs

177
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,960
don't have the training and experience

178
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,240
to deal with problem

179
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
and um i took a training course

180
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,759
sometime during the pandemic it's all

181
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,639
vague

182
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,720
um uh on street harassment called from i

183
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,240
hauler back

184
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
i highly recommend it to everybody it

185
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,080
does have things that apply to what you

186
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,319
just said disruptive it was more about

187
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,599
cat calling in the streets and what

188
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,960
people can do

189
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,479
that's the kind of training that i'm

190
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,520
after

191
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,840
okay because it puts us in gives us

192
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,120
specific tools even words and sentences

193
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
that we can use in those contexts when

194
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,560
we see them as opposed to oh something

195
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,360
bad's happening what do i do now right

196
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,200
so that's a specific thing that that i

197
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,360
really think we need and i will be happy

198
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,599
to send messages to whoever it is i

199
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,880
guess

200
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,399
emu der's chair

201
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
about how to do this

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,360
and uh yeah start in that direction and

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,519
uh the ombuds team is happy to help out

204
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,200
with that training and and find

205
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,399
resources

206
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,480
um but yeah folks are interested in that

207
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,040
and i think it's a good idea um to give

208
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,200
you all some tools and maybe come up

209
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
with some specific ideas about

210
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
you know for ietf context how best to

211
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
handle that stuff right good

212
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
i i think greg uh greg wood will be

213
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,880
giving us a little bit of an update on

214
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,800
the working group chairs training that's

215
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,399
planned for this year

216
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,000
that might touch on some of that but if

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,279
you have specific other additional

218
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,839
specific session uh

219
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,519
suggestions please feel free to send it

220
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,959
to the emo door mailing list

221
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,640
the mailing list for this particular

222
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
form remains working group chairs though

223
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,360
so feel free to send it there as well

224
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,680
uh hank

225
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,240
hi this is hank um so what i heard over

226
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
the course of the past days is about the

227
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,279
encouragement of

228
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,640
enticing people to become new blood

229
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,760
chairs

230
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,000
new influx of pool of cherish and i love

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,800
the

232
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,959
uh notion that if you're afraid of being

233
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,720
a chair so to speak

234
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,560
try shepherding first

235
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
so that but something i would actually

236
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,399
actively do in all

237
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
chat working groups i will talk about

238
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,240
the uh quickly talk about the uh

239
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
possibility to be a chair but if you are

240
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
not used to that we'll boil down to the

241
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
become a shepherd we have a lot of

242
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
documents and any chapters and then they

243
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,920
learn all the processes we'll be there

244
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,839
for you as the chairs

245
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,680
and happy with that and i think that's

246
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,480
an excellent way a segway into the uh

247
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
actual share duty and and i love the

248
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,279
idea and therefore yeah i'm an absolute

249
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,480
in favor of promoting that thank you and

250
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,200
to you know be more directly on this

251
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,839
topic if you do bring in shepherds which

252
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,360
i think is great

253
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,480
um

254
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,079
remember that your shepherd does not

255
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,440
have the same

256
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,079
uh authority that you have as chair so

257
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,079
please do uh

258
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,000
hold hands of shepherds and make sure

259
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,160
that if they are shepherding and someone

260
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,959
is getting out of hand that you are the

261
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,000
one to you know say to the person to the

262
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,360
other person

263
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
you're interfering with the progress of

264
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,200
this working group by misbehaving please

265
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
don't abuse the shepherd etc and so

266
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
forth so

267
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,839

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,600
uh hopefully you've noticed there have

282
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,639
been

283
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,720
rather large changes to the look and

284
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,360
feel of the data tracker um since the

285
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,279
last ietf meeting

286
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,040
and i expect the velocity of those

287
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,800
changes to

288
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,279
continue

289
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,399
we've moved all of our source control

290
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,680
and issue tracking into github under an

291
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,000
organization called ietf hyphen tools

292
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,639
if you've not been there yet please go

293
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,839
visit it

294
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,160
if you have issues to report with any of

295
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,920
the tools but particularly the data

296
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,760
tracker

297
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,680
use please use

298
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
github to report those issues that for

299
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,920
some reason you can't or if you think a

300
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,839
bigger discussion is needed before you

301
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,600
can really identify a specific issue

302
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,480
use the tools discuss list

303
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,120
so email to tools discuss is always

304

we are keeping our um

317
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,480
notes in minutes in the notes.itf

318
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
site and in the slide deck that i sent a

319
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,560
link to to the chairs list yesterday

320
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,638
i pointed to one of the recent

321
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,839
set of notes and from there you there's

322
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,480
a doubly linked list that will take you

323
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,040
back through past meetings notes as well

324
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,680
um

325
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,399
you can look in that slide deck for some

326
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,519
of the updates on specific tools

327
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,360
the things that i wanted to call out

328
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
during this meeting was to remind

329
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,440
everyone that we're very near the end of

330
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,279
the

331
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,040
tools.ietf.org transition

332
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,519
you're expecting to start redirecting

333
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,000
tools.ietf.org completely the week after

334
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,160
this meeting

335
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,279
um

336
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,000
and i fully expect that when we start

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,560
that redirection some new and unexpected

338
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,880
things are going to break

339
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,639
please use tools discussed to to

340
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,880
help us identify those

341
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
if and when you run into them

342
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,360
so that we can address them going

343
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
forward

344
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,240
one of the

345
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,279
last things that we've been working on

346
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,639
with the transition from tools is the

347
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,880
replacement for the bibxml service at

348
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,519
xmlrc.tools.itf.org it's currently

349
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,000
running at bib.ietf.org

350
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,000
those of you that have been

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
doing

352
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
a lot of draft work have probably

353
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,720
run into issues if you've had references

354
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,810
using cram down in particular or v2 to

355
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,120
[Music]

356
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
anything in the oidc section um sorry

357
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,600
not all adc um the

358
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,920
um oid

359
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,680
section

360
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,480
um

361
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,279
that's being resolved now hopefully we

362
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,040
will be resolved before we get into the

363
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,959
redirection when we when we get um

364
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,959
when we start the redirection next week

365
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,119
so

366
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
i guess one last reminder you run into

367
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,079
issues um

368
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,560
reporting things at github is great

369
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,880
mail to tools discuss is great if

370
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,440
there's something urgent like you're at

371
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,279
this meeting and you can't log into the

372
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,519
data tracker for some reason

373
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,600
support ietf.org

374
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,240
is always your best

375
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,800
channel to use for something needs to

376
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,920
get fixed right now

377
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,079
all right with that i'm going to stop

378
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,359
and take any questions

379
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,360
hi

380
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,959
sorry this is hank again

381
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,360
um that's actually not a question but

382
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,320
something um when i was preparing for

383
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,639
a working group came up um

384
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,399
it's a feature request and it will issue

385
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,560
something but i want to

386
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,040
maybe communicate it here right now

387
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,920
every

388
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,959
year we are sorry every measure every

389
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,360
session meeting session where we are

390
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,160
going to uh do the diff of

391
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,399
how the state of the data tracker of our

392
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,040
working group with respect to the id

393
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,920
state changed to the last meeting

394
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,360
so what we're doing is we're going

395
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,680
through all the ids checking what has

396
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
changed we should we should know but but

397
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,000
you know you're the meeting and then in

398
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,119
a diff tool like from last meeting to

399
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,559
this meeting

400
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,679
what was the state change of all

401
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,439
adopted ids

402
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,839
that would be nice i know we should all

403
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,919
know this from the top of our head but

404
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,959
sometimes we don't so so um and

405
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,880
and when we were doing the the the chair

406
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,959
slides where i was realizing what would

407
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,039
be probably easy to implement maybe i

408
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,919
don't know

409
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,400
um would be like um uh what's the diff

410
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,720
to the last meeting

411
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
so one quick question

412
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,960
with what you've manually prepared is

413
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
the most interesting thing

414
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,440
just the end points the state of the

415
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,799
last meeting in the state at this

416
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,919
meeting

417
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,240
or do you need the transition

418
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,320
transitional states in between

419
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,160
no no transitional states in between

420
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,880
just just the end points

421
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,120
just that you crazy that would be a

422
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,799
super chair comfy thing you know

423
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,640
and i think it might be very easy to

424
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,080
implement yeah

425
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,440
got it

426
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
okay

427
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,360
and happy that you look so well

428
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,440
thank you

429
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,679
hi uh lou burger sorry i didn't get into

430
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,000
queue but uh wasn't fast enough on that

431
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,160
phone um chris hopps wrote a tool that

432
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,960
does that it's in uh you can just do pip

433
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,440
i think it's um working group stats wg

434
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
stats and you can just install it

435
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,840
and

436
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,039
uh i don't think he's in the room but

437
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,799
maybe i'll send it to the list

438
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,720
but i use it all the time for preparing

439
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
my slides

440
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,760
pl please do send the link to the list

441
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,039
dave theater so i hadn't thought about

442
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,640
this but i think hank is exactly right i

443
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
think there's actually two different

444
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,960
things

445
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
um i'm not sure which one hank is

446
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,840
thinking about but i'm guessing it's the

447
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,280
first one which is

448
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
uh the draft status like the data

449
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,799
tracker for a working group says here's

450
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,320
all the working drafts and here's the

451
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,480
status and so on and so that would be

452
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,080
like the mature slides there's also a

453
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,919
similar thing that i do when i present a

454
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,919
particular draft to a meeting is i want

455
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,280
to know

456
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,039
the draft diffs

457
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,799
between a particular meeting and another

458
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,480
meeting right so right now there's a

459
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
bunch of work to say which version of

460
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,679
the draft was it that was the past

461
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,880
meeting

462
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
right because your diff one and diff two

463
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
links are the current draft against the

464
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,760
previous version right but the last

465
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,120
meeting could have been four versions

466
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,919
back

467
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,200
try to figure out which is the version

468
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
as of the last meeting and then generate

469
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
the diff url between that one and this

470
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,559
one that's actually what i do when i'm

471
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,039
preparing slides for a presentation okay

472
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,480
and that's actually not easy to do with

473
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,679
a bunch of clicks right now there's a

474
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,360
lot of manual work right now i think

475
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,960
that's the other point that i think is

476
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,400
as a

477
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,799
draft presenter to say is there an easy

478
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,240
way to get a diff between the current

479
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,120
version

480
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,200
and the version that was presented last

481
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
meeting and again only the end points

482
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,320
right

483
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,480
which would be the same thing as as the

484
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,360
the

485
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,120
the diffing utility right now is great

486
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
once you get the right url right it's

487
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,799
just getting what's the url that says

488
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,200
this version to that version is a bunch

489
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,000
of extra manual effort right now

490
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,480
all right thank you

491
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
any other questions or comments for

492
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,200
robert

493
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,559
oh

494
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,080
running back

495
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,840
at the expense of uh suggesting an

496
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,400
implementation if you could enter a date

497
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,240
to say show me the diffs between this

498
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,200
date

499
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,640
and today

500
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
that might be a way of implementing it

501
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
because you can look up what which draft

502
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
was posted most recently before that

503
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,440
date so being able to enter a date

504
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,960
because then you don't have to know what

505
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,080
meeting it was or whether it was an

506
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,120
interim meeting or a design team call or

507
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,039
whatever just enter a date generate me

508
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,960
the diffs

509
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,840
you can do that from the history

510
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,320
yeah yeah as as um don pointed out there

511
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
are links down in the history but you

512
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,080
have to manually compute when the

513
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,240
meeting was and go find it and i think

514
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,320
that we could make that um a little

515
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,240
uh

516
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,640
faster and more intuitive so that you

517
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,400
don't have to do the middle calculations

518
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,200
all right thank you for your time and i

519
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,559
hope to see you all soon all right

520
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,200
thanks robert uh i see greg's making his

521
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
way forward so the next subject is

522
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,000
information updates

523
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,039
uh yeah hi uh greg wood ietf llc staff

524
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,559
i've been working on a number of things

525
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,280
related to chairs so i'm really pleased

526
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
to be able to um

527
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,320
give a quick update on the three of them

528
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,640
uh which i don't have in my head but i

529
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,240
think i'll cover them all

530
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,159
so uh first on working group chairs

531
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,120
training

532
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,760
uh as you probably saw we uh had

533
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,360
training last year if you were around

534
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,159
then

535
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,919
and uh it was pretty well received and

536
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,799
we learned a lot and so we're uh after

537
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,799
um some discussion in the emoji group

538
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,080
we're going to be

539
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,159
doing a version of it this year it's

540
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,760
going to take what we learned and um

541
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,400
build on that so we're um the format's

542
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
gonna be slightly different uh we've

543
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,720
also assembled a

544
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
group as we had last year to give us

545
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,600
advice on

546
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,039
uh how to best structure the training um

547
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,720
or the content of the training and we

548
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,360
have engaged the same

549
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,159
experts training experts to help develop

550
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,280
the content and deliver the training so

551
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,880
expect some more news about that in the

552
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,039
next couple of months

553
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,600
we'll have both live

554
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,760
interactive sessions

555
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,880
and also sort of on-demand modules and i

556
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,720
heard the suggestion about a

557
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,919
possible

558
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,039
content

559
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,159
so feel free to send me email about that

560
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,159
and those those are expected to be

561
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,360
delivered in

562
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,280
october november as we as we had last

563
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,360
year so happy to take questions on that

564
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,200
um the second thing that we were talking

565
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
about uh is the chairs at itf.org again

566
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,440
um just just to remind folks that based

567
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,159
on input we had we've combined

568
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,880
content from

569
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,799
the

570
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,000
www.itf.org site that was focused on

571
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,080
chairs and also the content

572
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,120
on the old chairs wiki enrolled it into

573
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,799
a new wiki style platform um

574
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,640
at chairs.itf.org

575
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,799
so now there's a single source

576
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,840
for all the information that you

577
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,880
might want as chairs always open to

578
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,480
suggestions about how

579
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,240
best to organize

580
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
that and

581
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,679
content that

582
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,279
we might want to add to that so feel

583
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,080
free again to send suggestions along and

584
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,440
one of the areas that we're working on

585
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,960
there right now is to

586
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,120
uh make figure out a way to make sure

587
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,200
that that content on a regular basis

588
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,120
gets updated and stays

589
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,480
relevant so

590
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,840
uh what we found with the old chairs

591
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,039
wiki is that a lot of the content there

592
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,039
just had not been updated so we we want

593
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,200
a single source of information

594
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
uh that is always uh up to date and so

595
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,559
that's what we're working towards there

596
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,840
um

597
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,400
then finally uh and related to chairs

598
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
that it.org and also uh chairs in

599
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,400
general uh

600
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,039
we have um

601
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,279
stood up a new wiki uh itf wide wiki at

602
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,200
wiki.etf.org

603
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,799
um and this

604
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,440
past saturday we held a what we call the

605
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,120
content sprint

606
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,760
and the idea there is to figure out

607
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,440
all the details that we need to figure

608
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,559
out to get

609
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,480
content from the

610
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,520
old

611
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,880
track wiki

612
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
which will be going away

613
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,039
uh relatively shortly

614
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,919
um

615
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,600
so that we can get content from there

616
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,200
onto the new wiki.js platform so the the

617
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,520
content spent went really well actually

618
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,200
exceeded um expectations i think and um

619
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,880
we'll write up a summary of that and

620
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,360
provide a further update uh about what

621
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,240
that means for chairs of research and uh

622
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,440
working groups uh as part of the con

623
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,039
as part of the

624
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,000
sprint we actually moved over a number

625
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,159
of working group chair i'm sorry working

626
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,960
group

627
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
um

628
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,360
uh wikis from from track to wiki.edf.org

629
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,720
and um

630
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,559
yeah so that was that was really great

631
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,600
um so again that is going to continue

632
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,120
and the

633
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
goal that we've penciled in is to have

634
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,760
content

635
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,679
uh sufficiently moved over and dealt

636
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,480
with

637
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,039
so that um we can shut down the track

638
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,559
wikis somewhere around or after the next

639
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,120
itf meeting so

640
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,200
uh yeah and with that i'm happy to take

641
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,760
any questions

642
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,320
i see charles oh they see charles in

643
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,480
person and on mitako q which is

644
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,039
fantastic

645
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,679
okay yeah uh charles eckel thanks for

646
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,520
that update um

647
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,760
so for the the hackathon we make

648
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,080
extensive use of the wiki as well and um

649
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,480
i'm wondering if uh you know the format

650
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,000
of that's going to be different probably

651
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,919
than what each working i haven't looked

652
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,000
so much at the working group once but do

653
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,760
you think the strategy you're looking at

654
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,480
would also be able to bring that over we

655
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,600
have

656
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,440
a different wiki actually for each

657
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,200
hackathon we've had so there's a lot of

658
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,279
them

659
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,799
and like the meeting wiki i'm just

660
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,880
wondering like like how deep do you plan

661
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,120
to go in terms of

662
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,200
migrating data over

663
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,120
yeah so um

664
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,080
that's a great question so uh all the

665
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
wiki content on various

666
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,960
track instances is expected to move

667
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,559
either move to

668
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,400
the new wiki platform which is sort of

669
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,080
what we'd like to do for all active

670
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,039
content

671
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,720
uh which we will do for all active

672
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,960
content um so that includes the

673
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,360
hackathon wiki uh which obviously we'd

674
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,200
work with you and

675
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,159
barry and other folks on moving over and

676
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,480
also things like the meeting wiki so

677
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,159
the itf each ietf meeting has a wiki

678
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,760
and we uh

679
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,120
one of the things we did is sort of set

680
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,600
up the test version for 115

681
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,559
but

682
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,919
yeah just to answer your question all

683
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,039
the track

684
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,799
all the content that's now on a track

685
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,679
wiki uh needs to move to um wikijs or

686
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,240
if it in the case that it hasn't been

687
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,640
you know touched for eight years or nine

688
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,760
years

689
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,240
archived in some way okay and then you

690
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,399
you touched on my second question for

691
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,399
ietf 115

692
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,960
the meeting wiki and therefore probably

693
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,720
the hackathon would be should we plan on

694
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,039
that being in track or

695
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,039
uh is there a plan to kind of switch the

696
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,960
meeting wiki over uh for 115 you know

697
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,200
yeah ideally we'd have the all the

698
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,480
wiki's related to events in november on

699
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
the new wiki platform

700
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,840
and would want to work with you on the

701
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,760
hackathon obviously but the meeting wiki

702
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,640
is expected to be on uh

703
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,039
wiki.atf.org okay cool

704
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,000
yeah

705
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,240
cool

706
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,799
spencer dawkins and i

707
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,200
want to try to say quickly two nice

708
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,240
things

709
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
um

710
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,440
greg

711
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,360
i have really

712
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,559
been

713
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,279
impressed every time i've talked to you

714
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,200
in the past couple of years

715
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,399
about how helpful you have been knowing

716
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,960
things about the way things work

717
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,600
uh and especially the best way to get

718
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,840
things in front of the community

719
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,080
uh like when we were doing when we

720
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
started back up with the

721
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,240
hot rc talks that were

722
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,399
meet echo only

723
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,240
and things like that

724
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,399
i'd just like to

725
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,559
encourage other people to

726
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,360
seek you out because

727
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,080
you're a wealth of information

728
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,960
uh the other the related thing there

729
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,720
probably is that i wonder if there's uh

730
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,440
a good way to get you

731
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,200
doing a report like this in front of a

732
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,760
larger uh audience when that's when

733
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,000
that's appropriate uh just because you

734
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,240
know like the work you've done getting

735
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,200
youtube organized for us

736
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,440
i had no idea until you know i said

737
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,039
something stupid on a mailing list and

738
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,399
you said but spencer you know

739
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,159
it now works this way

740
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,320
so uh you know you do you actually do

741
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,559
things that are very valuable

742
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,480
just to think about the best way that

743
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,960
the broader community could

744
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,760
know about those things before

745
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,200
we already needed to know that

746
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,039
thank you again

747
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,440
well thanks spencer i was expecting the

748
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,279
two nice things and then maybe one

749
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,080
suggestion for improvement but

750
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,480
i'm also happy to talk to anybody so

751
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,159
thank you for um

752
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,600
making a point of that and uh

753
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
suggestions for improvement are always

754
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,679
welcome as well uh

755
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,840
yeah so we want this

756
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,640
um

757
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,919
all these things to work well for the

758
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,799
community and to uh and like emodure

759
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,520
just make the ietf work um

760
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,520
easier and better for for everybody

761
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,480
robert

762
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,039
so i wanted to call um attention to some

763
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,520
words that charles used in his question

764
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,039
that i think greg um

765
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,679
reshaped but i want to um

766
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,679
reiterate the reshaping

767
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,679
charles you asked

768
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,120
greg

769
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,320
how deep he planned to go

770
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,480
or the team that he was running planned

771
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,360
to go on content migration

772
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,559
and the answer is that he and his

773
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,760
direct team

774
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,559
have no plans

775
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,120
that line what is active has got to come

776
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,720
from the

777
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,640
subject matter experts for each group

778
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
for the things that are being moved

779
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,360
so

780
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,600
the the answer to the the question as

781
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,000
you stated literally is is that that

782
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,519
that's your

783
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,279
you need to figure that out and find

784
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,080
people to help greg in the migration

785
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,279
to uh to figure out where that line is

786
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,240
and what content is is actually

787
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,000
um

788
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,880
still active versus what is archival

789
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,840
yeah thank you

790
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,039
definitely need help

791
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,120
any other questions or comments

792
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,480
nope okay thank you very much

793
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,399
um

794
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,919
so we whipped right through those three

795
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,640
topics at this point we are in uh open

796
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,880
mic does anybody have anything they want

797
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,559
to raise to the working group chairs in

798
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,919
general

799
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:58,840
go

800
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,559
ahead

801
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,399
put yourself in the queue or stand at

802
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,559
the queue if that's

803
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,120
you can go ahead to the microphone

804
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,158
since you waved at me

805
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,880
thanks

806
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,120
jeff has so

807
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,519
this is intended to be a introduction to

808
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,440
a topic i suspect we'll want to talk

809
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,200
about this more detail

810
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,799
either on list or maybe special forum

811
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,320
so one of the interesting headaches

812
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,240
we're dealing with in idr and this is

813
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,600
something we've seen in other working

814
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,960
groups as well

815
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,120
is you know what happens when you have a

816
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,039
contentious topic

817
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,000
that

818
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
you sort of let the process move along

819
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,880
and

820
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,320
rather than converging on a single

821
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,679
solution

822
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,480
you can converge on more than one

823
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,320
and you know this is really not a thing

824
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,000
that's unique to idea you know i think

825
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,760
we've seen this in other working groups

826
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,600
such as spring and other places as well

827
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,760
so i'm not going to go into any specific

828
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,159
details about the headaches and just

829
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,600
talk about the more general details and

830
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,399
see what people think about it

831
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,320
the issue that we tend to have in terms

832
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,799
of our processes is we want to have

833
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,240
technical discussion

834
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,919
move and ideally we converge on a single

835
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,080
solution because the majority of time

836
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
it's a healthier thing for you know the

837
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
industry and the people using the stuff

838
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,720
that we produce

839
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,880
the challenge that we have is that uh

840
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,559
sometimes you know the there's multiple

841
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,240
incentives for us to not converge on a

842
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,360
single solution and eventually

843
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,440
if things are left alone for long enough

844
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,720
you know the divergence into multiple

845
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,480
solutions gets the multiple deployments

846
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,399
and there's really not a chance to do

847
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,720
that convergence that's that's just

848
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,480
basically the way things work

849
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,080
and sometimes that's the healthiest way

850
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,240
for things to go

851
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,120
the proposal i want to throw out

852
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
and get feedback from the other chairs

853
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,559
here is

854
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,120
in these sorts of circumstances

855
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,600
what might make sense as a

856
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,279
process

857
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,279
is that when we start seeing that these

858
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,039
you know things are starting to happen

859
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,480
and usually you can

860
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,000
get a feel for this in the working group

861
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,919
based on level of interest

862
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,200
the participants and you know how

863
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,480
they're sort of separating themselves at

864
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,880
the various camps rather than letting

865
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,600
the

866
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,079
various camps go off into their own and

867
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,440
diverge and potentially never reconverge

868
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
it may make sense in some circumstances

869
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,599
to simply have the working group

870
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,480
force adoption of the topic

871
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,320
and allow the work to you know basically

872
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,000
happen in the context of the working

873
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,320
group and if you want your solution to

874
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,359
move forward

875
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,719
you have to cooperate with all the

876
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,000
participants

877
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,520
basically force the thing that sometimes

878
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,440
happens at the tail end of the rfc

879
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,960
process

880
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
and clearly there's especially when

881
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,399
there's a strong disagreement with how

882
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,320
things could go this may delay things

883
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,079
going forward at all

884
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,520
and depending on

885
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,280
your protocol and what your code point

886
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,199
allocation strategies look like

887
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,879
you know the

888
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,280
itf allocation processes they allow

889
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,440
people to simply move off into their own

890
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,679
stuff anyway

891
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,760
so the topic i started about a q is what

892
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,240
do people think about this idea that

893
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,800
as a mechanism to try to sort of head

894
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,040
off this sort of disagreement

895
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,720
let's you know sort of encourage people

896
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,040
to have this discussion at upfront

897
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,880
maybe discourage allocation of code

898
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,400
points you know that allow these things

899
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,480
to happen

900
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,640
okay so um

901
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,160
i'm guessing the next two people in

902
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,400
queue are not on this subject so is

903
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,839
there anybody that wants to comment on

904
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,560
this specific subject

905
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,760
with apologies to the two people behind

906
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,839
them in line in the queue

907
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,160
so apologies i'm the other one of the

908
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,760
other idr chairs let me put a bit of

909
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,800
weight on that uh we've spent the last

910
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,599
month and a half trying to work on it

911
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,200
our email is what

912
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,920
oh it doesn't work that way okay sorry

913
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,040
you got a lot more work if you don't

914
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,680
take that approach we found it was

915
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,160
lots of work and apparently i'm not

916
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,560
really good talking through a mic so

917
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,480
any other thoughts on this topic

918
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,440
i think it would be useful i don't i

919
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,119
don't remember exactly who suggested the

920
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,040
link to the external training for

921
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,560
conflict resolution i think that might

922
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,640
be helpful and i also think the training

923
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,880
that greg is giving is is going to

924
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,240
address that topic

925
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,359
so

926
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,800
at least parts of that topic it won't

927
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,320
address specifically what you're talking

928
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,040
about jeff but

929
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,400
maybe we should have some follow-up

930
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,960
offline conversation on it

931
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,400
um

932
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
i think charles you

933
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,280
charles go ahead

934
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,480
okay and uh if i can share my screen too

935
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,079
i think it might be a little more

936
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,079
helpful

937
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,640
um because i wanted to ask this charles

938
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,160
eccle i wanted to

939
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,800
point to uh or call out

940
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
just one of the many cool features that

941
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,320
have been added to the the data tracker

942
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
and um i don't know how many of you are

943
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,000
familiar with it i mentioned it in the

944
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,839
hackathon and i have a couple slides

945
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,599
that that i can send to the list if we

946
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,079
don't get them up here but

947
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,359
um

948
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,160
under in github you can

949
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,839
um sorry in the data tracker

950
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,440
you can

951
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,839
uh

952
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,839
just a second while i try to share my

953
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,280
slides here

954
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,640
okay great

955
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,720
i'll make it

956
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,960
so in the data tracker there's this

957
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,560
field it's kind of a little small there

958
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,800
but additional resources

959
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
and if you click on it one of the things

960
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,280
you can do is

961
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,800
you can add

962
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,040
related implementations

963
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,440
and just to give you an idea this again

964
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,960
is small it should go forward

965
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,200
hasn't advanced yet up there but

966
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,599
um you know in addition to attaching a

967
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,119
github repo

968
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,640
you can also

969
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,520
attach a related implementation

970
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,200
huh that's weird that it's not working

971
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,720
sorry about that

972
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,920
um

973
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,079
so we try to use this in the hackathon

974
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,599
and encourage people hey if you're

975
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,119
working on some code related to a

976
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,200
working group draft or an rfc or an

977
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,640
individual draft

978
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,800
um please go ahead and

979
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,240
and add it

980
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,320
uh using this related implementation so

981
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,880
people are able to find it and but one

982
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,800
of the challenges is if it's not an

983
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,960
individual draft they actually can't do

984
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,119
it themselves they have to go to their

985
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,200
working group chair and then you can do

986
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,359
it for them and i think for some people

987
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,280
just that one extra step

988
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,359
they either you know that keeps them

989
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,440
from doing it so

990
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,200
i don't know how much that's happening

991
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,680
but in any case as a working group chair

992
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,760
if you can encourage people to use this

993
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,000
functionality maybe when someone

994
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
brings a draft in an individual draft or

995
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,960
something when it gets added to your um

996
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,200
your working groups list of things if

997
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,119
you can ask them hey is there any code

998
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,440
associated with this and if so help them

999
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,280
to get this field set up

1000
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,720
uh i think it'd be great and so just uh

1001
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,959
thanks

1002
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,200
spencer dawkins

1003
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,040
i got up to say something else but i'd

1004
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,440
like to agree with what charles just

1005
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,280
said and and say

1006
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,240
i'm seeing

1007
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,640
now you know now that we're meeting uh

1008
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,359
in in person in hybrid meetings i'm i'm

1009
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,280
more aware of new participants who are

1010
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,400
bringing

1011
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,359
concrete proposals to the ietf with code

1012
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,640
behind them

1013
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,240
i can imagine for a new participant

1014
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,160
the idea of

1015
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,680
asking working group chairs to do

1016
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,200
anything might be kind of intimidating

1017
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,599
uh they will be less intimidated soon

1018
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,200
but

1019
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,440
just like i say just adding that is a

1020
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,720
another reason for uh

1021
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
charles to say you know have the working

1022
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,400
group chairs encouraging people to do

1023
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,319
that

1024
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,720
the thing i actually got up to say was

1025
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,160
now with two

1026
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,720
itf's hybrid ietf meetings behind us

1027
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,960
i'm wondering if there are

1028
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,040
if there's any additional guidance that

1029
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,960
we can give to

1030
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,000
people who are doing buff meetings

1031
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,760
especially working group forming boff

1032
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,599
meetings

1033
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,800
in

1034
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,960
a

1035
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,040
in a hybrid meeting environment

1036
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,839
um one of the conversations i was having

1037
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,359
in

1038
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,880
jabber with

1039
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,200
the people from mock was

1040
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,880
you know can you ask who in the room

1041
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,640
agrees with this and we get up and say

1042
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,480
roughly the same thing

1043
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,720
so that they're not having to chase plus

1044
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,880
ones all over the place but

1045
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,400
you know just to ask a question like

1046
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,280
that i don't know if that's good advice

1047
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,800
but it seems like

1048
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,400
it would be good for

1049
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,240
people who are smart about sharing

1050
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,079
meetings and things like that who have

1051
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,000
good ideas like

1052
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,240
the working group chairs to uh be

1053
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,480
thinking about that between now and

1054
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,599
november thank you

1055
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,720
wes hertika uscisi and one of the guides

1056
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,599
leads

1057
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,200
spencer i want to follow your note with

1058
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,520
another one saying you know it's really

1059
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,200
important that working group chairs

1060
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,960
figure out how to help newcomers get

1061
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,000
involved

1062
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,079
but but even to a bigger area one of the

1063
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,359
things i realized especially for the

1064
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,280
buff i ran yesterday is a lot of times

1065
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,280
we have newcomers coming to the ietf to

1066
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,680
bring their work and their ideas

1067
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,520
and we have this notion in the ietf

1068
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,599
sometimes of well that's an area that we

1069
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,880
don't work in

1070
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,800
well how does the ietf expand if we

1071
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,640
don't figure out how to add new topics

1072
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,400
in new areas it may not be things that

1073
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,920
we work in but we have sort of the

1074
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,880
expertise to help them bring that in

1075
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,359
right and that this happens a lot for

1076
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,240
for

1077
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,160
especially new boss that come in that

1078
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,319
that are entirely new areas of work and

1079
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,319
then we should figure out

1080
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,640
how do we help them integrate even if it

1081
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,560
may be a new topic in a new area for

1082
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,040
ourselves

1083
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,000
paul valkos uh emodia reviewer

1084
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,160
apparently so uh this quick question um

1085
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,000
i'm not sure what an emoji reviewer is i

1086
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,760
guess it's an artifact of being part of

1087
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,560
the emu i can't hear you

1088
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,800
that's secretary sorry um i just noticed

1089
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,040
that it says emudia reviewer behind my

1090
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,520
name and west's name and so i'm assuming

1091
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,160
that it's just being part of the uh emo

1092
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,319
director because we don't do reviewing

1093
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:01,040
right

1094
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,319
right it's

1095
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,920
it's one of the things where the emoji

1096
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,440
directorate is called the directorate

1097
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,560
but it doesn't look like other

1098
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,480
directorates and so

1099
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,280
it

1100
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,480
that okay that's sort of there's some

1101
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,000
issues there i mean it's the same reason

1102
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,160
why this meeting fell under emodure

1103
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,240
because of the way yeah okay so i mean

1104
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,400
we need to work on that but sure sure i

1105
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,599
know that that's not why i was coming to

1106
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,280
the microphone um i was actually i

1107
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,319
wanted to talk a little bit about the

1108
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,480
previous topic of the uh implementation

1109
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,680
section um we do have an implementation

1110
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,880
status

1111
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,200
section in the draft it would be nice if

1112
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,119
the data tracker could either

1113
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,000
warn via the idnit's tool to say that

1114
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,760
there are implementations listed in the

1115
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,359
data tracker but you did not specify

1116
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,720
them in a draft

1117
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,240
or even better

1118
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,359
to maybe generate the code for

1119
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,280
the implementation section draft when

1120
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,960
it's based on the data in the data

1121
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,359
tracker

1122
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,480
okay thank you

1123
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,040
yeah i want to talk about

1124
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,240
um

1125
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,160
issues besides meetings that we have

1126
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,760
this week so

1127
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,200
um

1128
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
outside meetings we're trying to be

1129
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,960
remote friendly and it's really

1130
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,480
challenging so

1131
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,160
i don't know if this is the right forum

1132
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,560
to discuss this or talk about this

1133
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,200
but i was wondering if there's a way to

1134
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,720
kind of help us

1135
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,560
kind of enable that

1136
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,599
meeting to be remote friendly not asking

1137
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,760
for full support from me deco but

1138
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,720
somehow to allow us to

1139
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,040
easily allow remote participation

1140
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,640
because it was really kind of

1141
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,920
challenging

1142
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,160
this week

1143
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,439
uh durov

1144
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,839
i i do think to

1145
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,520
the issue of side meetings and open

1146
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,680
participation inside meetings is

1147
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,800
something that could probably use

1148
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,520
further discussion i didn't

1149
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,040
i'm just not sure what the answer is at

1150
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,800
this point

1151
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,760
durov did you want to join

1152
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,160
sorry i think that's my mistake

1153
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,839
oh his mistake okay

1154
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,400
all right any other questions or

1155
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,240
comments for this forum

1156
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,200
all right uh with that

1157
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,760
oh wait i see

1158
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,079
i guess

1159
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,119
so i'm not clear on

1160
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,200
how to proceed from here like what what

1161
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,880
do i need to do to

1162
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,200
kind of have is that a discussion or

1163
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,079
some

1164
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,359
some way to get help with that so

1165
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,079
what is the right course of action here

1166
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,079
um

1167
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,240
i i'm not and i mean it

1168
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,040
it's

1169
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,720
to a certain extent it's a resourcing

1170
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,760
issue

1171
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,040
uh so i i don't know how

1172
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,839
um

1173
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,079
i

1174
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,000
i'm pausing i see somebody slowly

1175
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,040
walking up behind you

1176
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,560
alexa thank you

1177
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,800
we'll see if we have the same answer uh

1178
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,599
this is alexa my um closer understanding

1179
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,839
is that it is an isg decision and so

1180
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,359
this is this needs to be taken up with

1181
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,280
the isg who's been they've been pretty

1182
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,160
clear

1183
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,280
they don't want to provide a lot of

1184
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,960
support for side meetings uh formal

1185
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,800
support but it's something that should

1186
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,480
be raised with the isg

1187
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,920
okay thank you

1188
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
uh pete are you going to the queue barry

1189
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,880
levi

1190
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,720
i can say something that lars told me

1191
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,960
the other day okay that they're working

1192
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,119
on getting a different skin

1193
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,440
on the

1194
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,280
on meat echo that would make it clear

1195
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,040
that this is a side meeting and not an

1196
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,160
ietf

1197
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,200
meeting

1198
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,440
and that that might be the way forward

1199
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,040
with this so that they could then

1200
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,520
provide meat echo for that but that's

1201
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,760
early stages right now so it's it's in

1202
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,839
their queue

1203
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,119
this is pete par part of the issue is

1204
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,520
that the more side meetings

1205
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,440
get official uh recognition by the ietf

1206
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,040
lots of other

1207
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,160
uh procedural things start to kick in so

1208
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:28,880
the

1209
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,880
iasg has always been of the mind that

1210
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,960
you want to keep these things very

1211
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,359
separate the initial idea was we're

1212
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,000
providing room space only because it was

1213
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,680
available anyway and so that would be

1214
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,160
convenient but if you start doing well

1215
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,040
we want the ietf tools available in the

1216
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,440
room with audio support with remote

1217
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,839
participation it starts to become an

1218
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,200
officially sanctioned thing and

1219
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,119
that's the concern of the isg so the

1220
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,480
more we can provide but make it clear

1221
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,559
that it's separate

1222
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,119
that that's a possibility

1223
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,480
just one more point um

1224
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,160
about that is

1225
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,240
it's you know

1226
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,720
i think we can hear that uh you know

1227
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,240
please we would like some help with side

1228
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,960
meetings um what would be a lot more

1229
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,079
helpful than that is uh specifics about

1230
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,040
exactly what kind of help would be

1231
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,200
most helpful like what what exactly are

1232
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,559
the pain points

1233
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,559
and then you know maybe as pete said

1234
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,000
they can be addressed or maybe they

1235
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,920
can't be um and you can you know talk in

1236
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,000
the mic or put any email to iesg at or

1237
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,960
whatever works for you

1238
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,839
go ahead go

1239
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,599
i just wanted to um say plus one to what

1240
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,920
john said about that one of the things

1241
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,160
that we're trying to train people to do

1242
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,520
in the hot rc talks is to be very clear

1243
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,240
about what kind of help you're asking

1244
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,040
for

1245
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,640
you know do you do you want somebody

1246
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,400
with a certain kind of expertise do you

1247
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,359
want collaborators do you want implement

1248
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,079
or something like that i think that

1249
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,359
trying to

1250
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,680
uh have that same mindset for side

1251
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,720
meetings

1252
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,200
may be very helpful also you know is

1253
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
this a is this a general knowledge

1254
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,400
sharing thing

1255
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,559
is this uh you know we want to work on a

1256
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,800
charter together whatever but just to

1257
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,040
say what what's the ask

1258
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,480
for people who come to the meeting

1259
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,760
sorry

1260
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,079
the ask is

1261
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,040
the ask is a i want to be able to

1262
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,359
allow remote participation i'm not

1263
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,440
asking for full support for miteiko

1264
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,160
maybe that the idea of a light miko meat

1265
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,040
echo is is the right answer but i

1266
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,200
instead of me dealing with the audio not

1267
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,240
working

1268
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,480
mute this unmute that

1269
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,000
took 10 15 minutes just to figure it out

1270
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,319
if we can have that setup at least no

1271
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,720
again not asking for full support maybe

1272
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,400
that that the me take a light is the

1273
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,000
right answer i don't know

1274
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,960
but

1275
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,079
if i schedule a meeting or or a webex or

1276
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,000
whatever i want to be able to allow

1277
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,400
those remote participation right that's

1278
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,839
all i'm asking right

1279
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,598
okay

1280
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,599
i think we've heard that this is

1281
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,599
something the isg is looking at and so

1282
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,960
but we can probably expect some

1283
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,839
additional information at some point in

1284
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,599
time are there any more topics for open

1285
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,839
mic

1286
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,400
okay with that i'd like to go ahead and

1287
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,359
adjourn this meeting

1288
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,000
please be sure to take your garbage

1289
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,119

1290
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,319
