this is the agenda that we posted um

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,600
several uh

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,798
i don't believe this is the agenda

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,960
i think that we're missing

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,200
yes that looks more like the agenda that

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,479
we posted yeah

42
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,318
did we include a second slide

43
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,319
oh that's a status light

44
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,640
yes they're right sorry

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,760
this is just to say uh the documents

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,840
that had reached some uh

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,160
milestone and remind people that uh

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,360
error handling closes today in terms of

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,920
its last call i had not seen

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
any comments on the list this week

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,519
but we were hoping to

52
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,160
deal with any uh comments that came out

53
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,760
during the

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,480
session today that there were

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,760
and uh

56
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,519
on the last one the

57
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,480
the

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
oob document we had said

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
when the next one's updated we will

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,760
start uh working group last call we're

61
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
still waiting to see that document

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,720
so that's nudge

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,200
next i let the notes say that john

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
raised the thumb

65
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,239
yeah this is chris um

66
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,400
there was some comments from paul that i

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,519
think

68
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,360
i included that in my slides to talk

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
about okay

70
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,680
so okay thank you

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,840
been a little uh distracted from my

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,239
emails

73
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,800
one comment here i think the uh version

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,159
numbers have all updated since we made

75
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,400
this slide at least the first two no the

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,120
first two have

77
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,360
next

78
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,519
and this is the agenda the one that was

79
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
posted um

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,799
a couple weeks ago

81
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,159
any agenda bashing

82
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,480
then let's proceed with this

83
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
yeah you close it

84
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,879
and this is

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
okay

86
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,840
yay okay so um

87
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,640
as noted uh there's 19 which was

88
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
recently released

89
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
um i believe mostly editorial but i'm

90
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,719
not going to go to the next slide

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,279
as i just said

92
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,600
most of the changes

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,680
between 17 and 19

94
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,320
have been mostly editorial and discussed

95
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,880
on the list

96
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,520
between meetings

97
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,639
uh

98
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
do appreciate all the editorial cleanup

99
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,000
that happened especially

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
in the abstract and intro there's it's

101
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
been the document's been obviously

102
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,759
changing

103
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,280
uh for a while now and um mostly there

104
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,759
were changes to bring things up to date

105
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,240
with some of the changes

106
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,680
um

107
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,080
and i added some examples and some other

108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,360
things like that

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
there was one normative language change

110
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,840
uh that was actually i think

111
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,919
ben's comment uh

112
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,800
i changed a must to a should in the

113
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,520
security considerations section

114
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,360
and i have the exact quote down there um

115
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,240
ben you have a comment

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,600
i was

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,639
just going to say i think my comment was

118
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,240
about the normativity not necessarily

119
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
the must versus being must versus being

120
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,479
should it was along the lines of trying

121
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
to make normative requirements on the

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,680
ecosystem

123
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,720
um

124
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,199
and kind of dodgy to me but i don't have

125
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,240
a strong feeling they won't wear the

126
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,600
other so

127
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
i don't know why are you saying that

128
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,600
even with should as being a normative

129
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,639
thing

130
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,720
you know i guess i'm okay with should

131
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,720
it's still normative but uh

132
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
i guess i i just my intention is to make

133
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,800
it i don't hate it enough to push

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,319
another revision unless another reason

135
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,080
to

136
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,759
any comments about that i mean i guess

137
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,199
i think the statement we want to

138
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,560
make sure people are thinking about

139
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,440
appropriate policies uh along with this

140
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
but um and i think that was sort of the

141
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
spirit that

142
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,600
those normative comments were

143
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,440
implied but

144
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,800
i'm i'm okay either way

145
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,080
i don't see anybody

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,719
objecting so

147
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,520
john peterson so i mean look the part of

148
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
it is that we're not going to

149
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
bless any such entity right or a set of

150
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,080
policies here in the itf right i mean i

151
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
can imagine use cases for an rcd

152
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,199
passport

153
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,759
that you know are much more informal

154
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,319
outside of shaken like contexts

155
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
and so i don't think an itf

156
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,000
specification should

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,759
you know stipulate anything too strongly

158
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,400
there

159
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
i agree the wording here is kind of

160
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,919
tortuous right it's got

161
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,479
the varsity passport lowercase must

162
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,639
follow some form of vetting in which and

163
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,160
then should follow and it's like a

164
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,080
policy of an ecosystem

165
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,000
um i just i don't think we want to

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,319
require that an ecosystem have such an

167
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,080
applicable policy that's really what it

168
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,639
comes down to

169
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,000
everything

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,240
we have remote we have remote people

171
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,360
please

172
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,240
no mister linux

173
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,680
i mean i guess and technically we should

174
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,039
be using the cube but yeah sorry go

175
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,319
ahead i guess everything follows you

176
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,160
know follows the null policies trivially

177
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,759
but i guess maybe that's

178
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,440
you know not interesting to say also

179
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,479
there's something wrong grammatically

180
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,440
with that sentence

181
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,319
yeah i'll admit i missed the first must

182
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
no no it's more whether it's identity

183
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,400
but what are what is the is

184
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,800
is that meant to be id apostrophe s or

185
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
there's also a list with no and i'm

186
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
confused by the grammar of that sentence

187
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,878
but anyway

188
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,039
okay

189
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
there there will be hopefully before

190
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
even the artist rc editor is left with

191
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
the daunting task of like turning this

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
into english we probably should do like

193
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,120
an englishing pass at some point

194
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,240
well there will be a 20 no matter what

195
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,080
but i guess the question is does that

196
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,440
happen before

197
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
working goose last call or not

198
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,320
we're in working through last call

199
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,599
or

200
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,679
getting out of working with nascar sorry

201
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,399
i apologize

202
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
so the question to me is whether you

203
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,000
want a 20 that gets sent to the area

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,640
director or you want to send 19 to the

205
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,959
area directory

206
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,519
i mean i i would be okay sending 19 to

207
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,680
an area director making it their problem

208
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
i'm sure there will be some editorial

209
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
feedback that will come back in addition

210
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,839
everything else

211
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,480
this is rich shockey i agree with

212
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,760
jonathan

213
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,640
with mr peterson

214
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,640
i would certainly support sending my

215
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,279
team forward as soon as practically

216
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,279
possible there is a queue of

217
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,320
implementers ready to use this

218
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,120
uh

219
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,839
sooner rather than

220
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,680
i fully agree with that

221
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,160
so what i

222
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,600
heard is we're going to leave this

223
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,360
grammatical error in there to see if the

224
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,820
ad notices okay

225
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,190
[Laughter]

226
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,000
i will comment then again uh

227
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
the clearer it is the quicker it will

228
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,800
get through the initial ada review

229
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,440
um i don't think this is necessary a

230
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,600
clarity problem but

231
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,360
just something to keep in mind

232
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,399
all right

233
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,680
all right we're going to send it today

234
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,399
you already have the

235
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,000
all right i think the next page is did

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
that jump too far no it's good

237
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,040
so can the authors please send me a

238
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,160
statement about the ipr so that i'm not

239
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
waiting on that when i do the write-up

240
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,200
yes

241
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,320
okay

242
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,560
thank you

243
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,079
okay close that i think i do have

244
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,800
already started

245
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,760
next is

246
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,480
what's next for the agenda i don't want

247
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
the agenda okay

248
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,719
next is message okay

249
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,040
welcome to reality this is billy in

250
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,959
reality it's not

251
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,399
just online

252
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,959
um although many are on

253
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,320
next slide please we're about to talk

254
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
about messaging and i'm going to try to

255
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,760
talk through a mask because i think it's

256
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,440
the first time i've ever given a talk

257
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,079
through a mask we'll see how it goes

258
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,680
um so as you can see at the top of the

259
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,839
slide there was a draft itf stir

260
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,640
messaging zero three and i immediately

261
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
replaced it with a zero four uh like

262
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,000
yesterday which i'm sure no one in here

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,399
has read but for those that have not

264
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,959
been following this work just you know

265
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,600
like a page turner novel um what this

266
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,320
draft basically is suggesting is that

267
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
the systems we built for stir especially

268
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,079
the certification systems that are now

269
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,680
widely deployed and are being more

270
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
worldly widely deployed worldwide

271
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,000
you know probably could be repurposed to

272
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
handle text and multimedia messaging

273
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,160
instead of just setting up telephone

274
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,200
calls

275
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
and of course the systems we have set up

276
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,880
for this in certification are limited to

277
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,800
telephone numbers so we're not talking

278
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
about you know messaging that has

279
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,760
nothing to do with telephone numbers and

280
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,880
there's a ton of that and it's super

281
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,800
interesting messaging but for the moment

282
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,240
the restriction of the scope of this

283
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,399
draft is to that i will remind people

284
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,920
however that is not a restriction

285
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,040
inherent to passports or to their

286
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,920
transmission in stir just to

287
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,279
the

288
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,040
certification systems we have specified

289
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,360
here in the itf so far

290
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
why are we doing this well you know

291
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,839
robocalling is like super annoying but

292
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,160
message bam is becoming a problem that's

293
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,639
equally annoying in a lot of places

294
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,560
and so you know you can kind of you have

295
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,839
some different tools you can bring to

296
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,240
bear on trying to prevent spam and

297
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,360
messaging

298
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,279
but especially as encrypted messaging

299
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,120
rises these kind of bayesian tools we

300
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,959
use for email analysis to figure out is

301
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,120
this about some sort of pharmaceutical

302
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,959
that perhaps is being widely advertised

303
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,639
or something like that can't really do

304
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,200
that for encrypted messaging so

305
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
uh we think this could help next slide

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
we had a working group last call much

307
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,040
like with rcd a shorter one um we did

308
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
get in a bunch of comments some of which

309
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,120
i addressed in zero three but a lot of

310
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
which i did not address in zero three

311
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,880
and so we are trying to clean all that

312
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,760
up thank you to christopher russ ben

313
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,839
brian rosen jack for reviewing that

314
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,399
next slide

315
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
i don't think there's like a ton more to

316
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,480
talk about about this

317
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
um you know there's a couple of topics

318
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,240
that i think we can go through that

319
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,000
maybe are still open issues we were just

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,680
talking about on the list

321
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,839
one for example would be allowing the

322
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,639
message i parameter in other passport

323
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,279
types than the message passport type

324
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,680
what is message i this is basically like

325
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
a hash that's over the content of the

326
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,760
message in particular the mind body so

327
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
whether that is you know multimedia it

328
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
could be multi-part it could have text

329
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,040
and all this other stuff but just take

330
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,079
the entire mind scope put hash over it

331
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,600
that's what gets embedded into the

332
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,199
passport itself

333
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,360
the question naturally arose

334
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
could there be other passports than

335
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,480
message in which we'd want to include

336
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,600
message on

337
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,120
following the great tradition where for

338
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,279
example we allow

339
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,360
rcd which is just an element that

340
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,440
appears in the passport to also appear

341
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
like in a shaky passport if people want

342
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,600
to do that are there similar cases or it

343
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
might make sense to have this like

344
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,360
message integrity parameter in some

345
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,440
other passport type

346
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,839
my argument is i don't think so

347
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,199
and like i think the opportunity for

348
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,240
confusion around this is too great

349
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,800
and that moreover um getting into this

350
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,279
polymorphism as we discussed on the list

351
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,320
where

352
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,760
how do you mix and match between these

353
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,120
different passport types this is like

354
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
all this aggravation and complexity and

355
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,720
household i see there

356
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,160
so i'm not super psyched about that but

357
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,839
i thought i'd give an opportunity if

358
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,920
anybody here would like to talk about

359
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
go to bat for the notion there could be

360
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
other passport types where message i

361
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,719
could appear

362
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
anybody care so i'm in the queue and

363
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,760
i'll say first for the record i did not

364
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,040
propose

365
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,000
polymorphism yes i just kind of wish

366
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
sometimes we headed but i'm glad we

367
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,480
don't

368
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
um

369
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,199
my main thoughts here was

370
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,199
not to make it hard for someone else in

371
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,800
the future who wants to specify another

372
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,160
use for this

373
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,199
and

374
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,920
you know if we say must not then any

375
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,519
if if we come up with another kind of

376
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,040
message passport in the future this is

377
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,639
where the polymorphism came in maybe

378
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,800
some kind of combination of rcd with

379
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,240
message eye or you know just throwing

380
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
something off we have to come back and

381
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,079
update this draft to allow something

382
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,199
else to do it

383
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,800
uh but that's i'm willing to pay

384
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,880
personally okay and that's

385
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,399
you know if if everyone else is okay

386
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,560
with that i'm okay with that too

387
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,639
it's a low cost it's a low bar you need

388
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,079
to have a spec anyway and you're just

389
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,800
adding like updates rfc this

390
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,880
uh whatever that spec is right

391
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,079
low cost

392
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,600
and it looks like we've got robert thank

393
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,360
you mr sparks what's up man

394
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,199
i'm not trying not to waste too much

395
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
time on this but

396
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,639
you're

397
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,120
really

398
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,199
how quiet now

399
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,279
a little better

400
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,720
so

401
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,759
part of

402
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,880
the reticence i think to just letting

403
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,600
other passport types pick this up

404
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
is based on confusion and i think that

405
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,279
we should spend

406
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,240
just a few seconds wondering if

407
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,399
our nice little short name

408
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,480
um msgi

409
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,440
the msg part in particular

410
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,199
is really going to be future proof

411
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,800
enough for us given how generic a name

412
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,120
it is and how easy it is to confuse what

413
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,160
you might mean by message

414
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,639
if the context isn't just dead freaking

415
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,320
obvious that you're talking about an

416
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,839
instant message kind of thing

417
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,839
i am going to i'm willing to entertain

418
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,839
and contemplate that for a moment

419
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,359
um we called the draft stir from

420
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,880
messaging we're using message pretty

421
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,400
generically we have a pretty generic

422
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
definition of message in the sense it's

423
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,400
not limited merely textual messages but

424
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,199
also incorporates multimedia messaging

425
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,280
i mean i guess i look at it

426
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,880
like you know we define two streams for

427
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,400
these things that could effectively

428
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
appear in the message by should say

429
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,359
three things could appear in the message

430
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,760
method things that could be negotiated

431
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,880
as part of a session by set like msrp or

432
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,520
whatever and then finally out of

433
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
to agree on how to ban

434
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,679
message can be taken pretty broadly when

435
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,120
you're no longer talking about like sith

436
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,640
is a transport

437
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,799
so

438
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,400
i don't know

439
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,919
i think message has enough of a kind of

440
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,200
stable

441
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,280
understanding i think people understand

442
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,679
that a message isn't an email

443
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,559
right

444
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,879
um

445
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,720
you can say email message it's true

446
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,440
um and then again i mean frankly a lot

447
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
of like smpp and protocols that are used

448
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,760
to transport these things like are often

449
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,160
smtp adjacent and

450
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,000
mms as well um

451
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,039
i don't know i think it's okay

452
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,360
i mean we could call it like a mime

453
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,600
thing like but then you lose the session

454
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,440
part it's like what else do you call it

455
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,160
i don't know yeah i know a better one

456
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,880
naming is one of the three hard computer

457
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,400
science problems

458
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,480
and i'm willing to leave it alone i just

459
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
wanted to kick it around for a minute so

460
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,039
you know the the kind of potential

461
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,160
confusion i can see at an implementer's

462
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
layer

463
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
especially if your implementers aren't

464
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,280
um native english speakers is is this

465
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,840
thing some sort of you know integrity

466
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,160
check over at the datagram that the

467
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,120
passport appears in kind of thing

468
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,000
so

469
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,960
you know

470
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,440
um but i'm i'm perfectly willing to

471
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,039
leave it alone

472
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,400
and i don't think it's any worse than

473
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,320
rcd and rcdi like what is rcd

474
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,200
right

475
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,280
and like that's also pretty open-ended

476
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
and pretty pretty gnarly really

477
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,799
jack what do you think man

478
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,490
i'm

479
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,360
[Music]

480
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,000
i kind of don't care from a message

481
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,080
point of view but the i'm slightly more

482
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,799
worried about the fact that

483
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,280
it's not

484
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,160
like

485
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
this could end up with some slightly odd

486
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,640
side effects like verifiers that

487
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,039
understand this message spec will

488
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,039
mark these as invalid but those that

489
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,360
don't will treat it as valid because

490
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,520
they'll just ignore the message i and

491
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,160
assuming it's not like a ppt like

492
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,480
sorry if there's a passport that's not a

493
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
message possible with a message eye on

494
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,520
it

495
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,039
so it could just have slightly weird

496
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,880
side effects that

497
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
i'm kind of slightly nervous about

498
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,480
yeah i mean that's that's why i don't

499
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,840
want to allow it right i said this on

500
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,600
the list like i'm totally worried about

501
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
those side effects i i want this to be

502
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
scoped to message passports for that

503
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,039
reason but i think robert was like

504
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,720
poking at something else like is is

505
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
message really the best description for

506
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,559
this or is there a crisper thing that is

507
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,480
closer to capturing like what we mean

508
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
other thoughts chairs can run the queue

509
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,200
i can barely see the queue over there uh

510
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,640
jack and what's the

511
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,559
beer

512
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,840
i was just gonna say i feel like you

513
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,720
kind of

514
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
missed the point of what i was trying to

515
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,440
say

516
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,960
which was

517
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,520
that like

518
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,720
you can't if you like there's a question

519
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,919
of enforcement on the verifier side

520
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,200
like a verifier that enforces this

521
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,280
will look very different to one that

522
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,840
doesn't

523
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,000
and that might cause problems like

524
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,559
admittedly like

525
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,919
designer should have never done this in

526
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,440
the first place the air should have

527
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,840
never done this but like from a vs

528
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,440
that's just

529
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,880
accepting random things from the

530
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,640
internet like you kind of have to worry

531
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
about that

532
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,120
i am not following you it's true

533
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,200
who does what be more be

534
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,559
elaborate a little bit because i'm not

535
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,039
getting you

536
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,158
um if a

537
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,200
future or weird

538
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,039
uh a s

539
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,520
creates a passport

540
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,360
with a message eye on it

541
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,440
that's not a not that that's not a

542
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
that's like ppt chicken or rcd or

543
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,840
whatever

544
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,320
a verifier that does not implement this

545
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,679
bag

546
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,720
will

547
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,039
carry on just fine

548
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,799
we'll go yeah everything's fine there's

549
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,400
this there's this weird message i but i

550
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,520
don't understand it so i'm going to

551
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,120
ignore it and ppt rcd lets me do that

552
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,480
right but a mirrorfile that does

553
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
understand this will go ha that's

554
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,320
message eye that's not meant to appear

555
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,520
on rcds

556
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,080
and then drop it

557
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,559
yeah

558
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,240
and that that

559
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,960
feels like odd behavior

560
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,080
where

561
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,799
someone who doesn't understand this will

562
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,240
verify call

563
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,320
like we'll just mark this figures

564
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,799
verified but one that doesn't

565
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,159
won't

566
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,760
but what is it going to do with an rcd

567
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,360
passport as a message eye in it what's

568
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,640
the message

569
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,720
well that doesn't matter

570
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,320
like oh i think it does i think it's

571
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,439
very similar to the question

572
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,600
it oh yeah the ais has done something

573
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,760
really funky here but like

574
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,919
from the vs's point of view like which

575
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,520
it's disallowed from doing if it's

576
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,200
compliant with the special oh yeah yeah

577
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,919
yeah

578
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,360
but like this is the internet we're

579
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,559
talking about

580
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,919
yeah the

581
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,600
so like

582
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,360
yeah i'm not i'm not convinced this is

583
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,880
definitely a problem but it just seems

584
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,080
very strange to me that

585
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
verifiers will

586
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
verify these passports correctly or

587
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
incorrectly depending on

588
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
whether or not

589
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,000
they implement this

590
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,039
spec

591
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,960
so i'd be willing to trade the language

592
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,840
for as may not include in pbts that are

593
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,480
non-message and vs's must ignore if in

594
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,720
ppts that are known message

595
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,760
that help

596
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,840
that would make me much more comfortable

597
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,360
okay i can do that

598
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,039
wait what's that last part

599
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,520
so it was a s's are disallowed from

600
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,440
including message eye in non-message

601
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,480
passwords and vs's that receive

602
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,720
message i and non-message passports

603
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,440
should it must ignore

604
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,520
it just i mean it's kind of what's

605
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,080
implied but it's not stipulated directly

606
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,760
by the text that's there now

607
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,400
i can do that

608
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
severe

609
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
okay thanks uh

610
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,279
so john i think that first blood point

611
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,039
um sorry i need to review the document

612
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,440
you must confess that but when you

613
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,480
mention that in other ppts right uh for

614
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,640
example we define other dvds for example

615
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
rph right

616
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,720
yeah we defined right so do we need to

617
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
do anything for those ppts or

618
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
yeah are you suggesting that's uh

619
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,000
because none of those ppts stipulate

620
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
using message i at this point right like

621
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,799
rph rph is already in rfc it doesn't say

622
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,960
anything about using messaging right so

623
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
this is this is basically again it's a

624
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,720
way to prevent there's a particular

625
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
confusion that is like the inverse of

626
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
what jack was just discussing that i'm

627
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,960
worried about okay which is a case where

628
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,320
somebody intends to be saying there's a

629
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,240
message i want integrity over they send

630
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,559
it in a non-message passport type and

631
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,080
the semantics of the fact that suppose

632
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,919
we had a message are lost if the

633
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,919
verification service doesn't recognize

634
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,279
message eye at all

635
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,360
and so a passport was intended to be

636
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,760
securing a message could be viewed as

637
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,679
being valid for like a telephone call

638
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,520
right and i'm concerned that there's

639
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,159
like a little bit of security weakness

640
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,720
in that if we don't clamp this down

641
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,559
the language i was discussing with jack

642
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,880
i mean it's a you know it's a much

643
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,960
crisper and you know more specific

644
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,000
version of the language it's in the

645
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,880
draft today i think that gets at what

646
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
i'm trying to prevent okay so i think

647
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,320
key is the

648
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,559
non-passport types right

649
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,120
that's non-message not a message yes

650
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,360
okay i just don't want again it's gonna

651
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,320
be really wonky and polymorphic in ways

652
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,360
i don't want

653
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,240
okay thanks thank god

654
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,559
chris

655
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,400
yeah i um

656
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,080
for me i i wasn't sure where we were

657
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,799
going but where we landed i i like so

658
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,840
thumbs up

659
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,000
okay

660
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
the other thing that really came up if

661
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,360
there's nothing more than this is

662
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,919
anybody else in queue on this no okay

663
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,200
the only other thing that came up that i

664
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,600
thought was like worth mentioning from

665
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,279
last call is really what we're opening

666
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,480
the door to

667
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,640
without a band for this

668
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,320
and just to make sure you know we all

669
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,760
here understand and are comfortable with

670
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,360
the notion that

671
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,000
much like with stir out of band you know

672
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,919
what we mean by out of band is non-sip

673
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,279
we mean that

674
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,559
you know there's something like an http

675
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,720
service that like is carrying these

676
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,880
passports and it's adjacent

677
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,520
to the telephone call in some fashion

678
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,600
the way it's stipulated in 8816 there's

679
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,760
a call placement service this is a web

680
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
service due to upload passports in which

681
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,360
they can be accessed by verification

682
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,960
services

683
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,159
like you know this could apply to

684
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,279
basically any kind of messaging right

685
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,279
um that you could build a web service to

686
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,320
be adjacent to from vanilla sms to very

687
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,440
complex you could do this for like

688
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,600
facebook messages right there i mean

689
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
that would be in scope of this um i

690
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,720
guess they don't use telephone numbers

691
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,480
so probably not we use it for whatsapp

692
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,279
let's say whatsapp

693
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,240
yeah yeah

694
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,600
so like i just want to make sure people

695
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,840
get it that there's nobody who's present

696
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,480
at this meeting that really feels like

697
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
this is too broad a scope to allow what

698
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,880
that will be for doing message i think

699
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,240
it's fine i think it's potentially

700
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,080
useful i think we get some actual like

701
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,360
leverage out of it

702
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,640
ben thoughts

703
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,279
um i i would like to keep it

704
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,400
um

705
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,480
one thing one thought i do have and now

706
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,600
i'm trying to remember what the text

707
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,120
actually says

708
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,480
is that

709
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,000
we the

710
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,400
draft contemplates that other messaging

711
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,159
types might use oob but it doesn't

712
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,679
specify

713
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,279
you know a particular binding to any

714
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,520
particular kind of messaging i mean it

715
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,720
alludes to like smpp right so it might

716
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,080
be worth

717
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,559
having some disclaimer language saying

718
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,240
but someone else has to go specify how

719
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,600
to do that

720
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,840
this that problem is not solved by this

721
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,320
draft it's merely hinting at a uh at a

722
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,240
uh solution direction that someone might

723
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,039
take

724
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,919
but in general the idea that uh

725
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,559
we could conceivably use this

726
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,320
for

727
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,399
messaging types that do not have some

728
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,799
way to carry a passport in band i think

729
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,640
is like is a road that we should not

730
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,919
close yet

731
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,960
yeah i mean again pointing to 8816 it's

732
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,840
not like out of band

733
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,600
says you know

734
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,440
and he puts any stipulations like that

735
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,880
right i mean it's very much just like

736
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,399
hey whatever communication system is

737
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,760
you're using it doesn't happen to be

738
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,640
safe

739
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,799
like you know cps can help you out with

740
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,080
that and i think we're saying the same

741
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,240
thing here and i i don't really know

742
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,279
that we need uh any additional kind of

743
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,799
hazard tape around that to get that

744
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,240
across

745
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,159
uh john max i mean the one concern i'd

746
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,120
raise is that once you know

747
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,480
since you're doing a cryptographic hash

748
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,320
over the message you better make sure

749
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,600
that whatever you're doing

750
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,679
is a 100 percent unambiguous way of

751
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,360
concluding itself as a mind

752
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,919
body and not you know

753
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,360
anything like you know oh hey we did

754
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,880
unicode normalization or something weird

755
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,240
like that so

756
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,080
yeah i mean it's a requirement in the

757
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,640
draft now that you know whatever it is

758
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
turn this into mime and like that times

759
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,760
we're signing over and has to be

760
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,919
unambiguous but like yeah i mean just it

761
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,320
seems to be harder for oob when it's not

762
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,200
when

763
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,559
you have to translate it out of mind and

764
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,399
then back in so but that's not your

765
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,840
problem here i guess

766
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,639
i hope it's not

767
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,320
all right i just want to make sure we

768
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,240
aired those two issues other than that i

769
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,440
don't think there's much by way of open

770
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,279
issues remaining here

771
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,200
i think we got it and i think we should

772
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,399
uh

773
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,960
declare working last call has occurred

774
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,799
and that we did this and we should ship

775
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,760
it unless does anybody here think this

776
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,279
requires more before we ship it

777
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,000
hearing no

778
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,360
sentiments i will leave that matter to

779
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,840
the chairs to result and you know

780
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,080
did anyone put anything in chat

781
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,799
no no not a few seconds okay just making

782
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,159
sure

783
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,080
so john just one question this version

784
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,559
is the one you think is ready to go

785
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,000
uh zero four yes right so uh it's just a

786
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,760
matter of i'll be the shepherd on this

787
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,120
one so it's a matter of me getting the

788
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,640
proto right up done and then we'll ship

789
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,000
it

790
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,600
i heard i heard an agreement to add a

791
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,039
little bit of text that you probably

792
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,120
don't want to add

793
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,960
i did just agree to that and i'm totally

794
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,520
going back on it well like so jack would

795
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,919
you be cool if we did that insertion

796
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,880
after itf last call

797
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,240
that would be a typical way to resolve

798
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,360
this we just make sure we won't lose

799
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,520
that

800
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,559
it's

801
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,799
what a 10 minute cycle to add that

802
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,720
[Music]

803
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,240
just as long as it's close to the top of

804
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,960
your new stuff cue

805
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,760
and next is error handling

806
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,559
we're not done

807
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,159
no he said the comments came in

808
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,799
yes i've included

809
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,760
so next slide

810
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,159
uh just to go over the changes from the

811
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,480
last version

812
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,080
i did

813
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,840
change ppt to ppi

814
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,080
which maybe is better like passport

815
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,720
identifier

816
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,559
and i did miss uh adding a request for

817
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,799
that um parameter name so i added that

818
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,000
as well

819
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,559
and then probably the most substantive

820
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,320
thing that i have here is that

821
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,200
i made the compact form the recommended

822
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,399
form

823
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,559
uh given the security issues that have

824
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,399
all been brought up and i think we sort

825
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,360
of

826
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,760
discussed that at the last meeting and

827
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,200
i think had

828
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,919
talent of agreement on that um i have

829
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,360
not removed support for full form

830
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,440
but you know have all the caveats in the

831
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,519
document for

832
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,120
potential uh

833
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,039
you know giving up of information if it

834
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,720
goes past the

835
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,559
you know for diversion

836
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,559
uh use cases where

837
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,200
the full passport could go upstream from

838
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,159
the

839
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,320
authentication service that

840
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,519
created that passport

841
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,200
next slide

842
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
so um

843
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,600
there there have been some um list

844
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,000
discussions that i wanted to highlight

845
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,080
uh paul's came in

846
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,279
um

847
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,600
very recently um but i think are

848
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,919
relevant to talk about

849
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,159
christopher did have a comment

850
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,840
um from a little while ago

851
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,320
that i was trying to figure out that he

852
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,600
asked about

853
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,679
announcing support for the reason header

854
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,480
specific to the specification or the

855
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,279
stirrer protocol

856
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,279
i'm not really aware of a precedent for

857
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,679
doing that

858
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,000
so i was hesitant to

859
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,760
include that but

860
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,399
certainly up for discussion whether

861
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,679
and there's any

862
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,279
thoughts that this might be a good idea

863
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,039
i see roberts in queue robert

864
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,399
i'm sorry i put myself into anticipating

865
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,399
moving on to the next point so i'll

866
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,320
remove myself and add myself again in a

867
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,440
moment

868
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,320
okay yeah i was just going to say i mean

869
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,000
and correct me this is a good rubber

870
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,919
question and then question and other sit

871
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,399
mafia people here there's no like

872
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,279
supported required whatever for a reason

873
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,240
is there in any i i went glanced back at

874
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,919
whatever that is 33 28 or wherever we

875
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,440
specified reason i didn't see anything

876
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,080
like that so

877
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,919
so this is robert the

878
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,840
you're very quiet again remember

879
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,399
um it's it's been a

880
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,600
constant churn though on the maps of

881
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,399
having this implied support signaling

882
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,360
thing and had it did come up the last

883
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,799
time we were

884
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,080
seriously punching through reason um and

885
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,399
kind of remembering it coming in through

886
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,960
history info and every time we've driven

887
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,799
our way through the conversation in the

888
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,079
past we've ended up on that that kind of

889
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,079
implicit signaling is not helpful and

890
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,040
that we wouldn't do it

891
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,639
okay

892
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,119
i mean we do re a lot of the purpose of

893
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,719
this draft was to align some of the

894
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,399
things we did in

895
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:29,040
1074. um we had we did not put that in

896
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,280
there that's not necessarily

897
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,760
a good or bad reason to to not do it but

898
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,639
i'd certainly prefer

899
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,719
the path forward to not

900
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,598
have to define that

901
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,560
jonathan the next does anything go wrong

902
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,239
you just blindly insert it i mean if

903
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,760
somebody ignores it okay they don't know

904
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,639
why

905
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,918
you didn't know what went wrong but they

906
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,520
wouldn't have done it wrong or wrong if

907
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,040
you didn't insert it in the first place

908
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,560
so

909
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,000
yeah i agree yeah

910
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,640
like if you don't understand stir

911
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,680
um reason headers then stir protocol

912
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,200
reason hitters then you just ignore them

913
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,880
well this is rich shocking there are

914
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,320
obviously presidents here which is 608

915
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,440
you know 608 reason codes 607

916
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,520
and the soon to be

917
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,720
finalized 603 reason code

918
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,839
for

919
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,359
blocking

920
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,759
of

921
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,400
blocking of calls in the network which

922
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,599
is

923
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,280
shall we say

924
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,839
aggravated certain

925
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,400
elements of

926
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,640
industry

927
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,960
so i mean there is ample president for

928
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,680
reasons reason codes

929
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,680
yeah reason hitters in general it's just

930
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,440
announcing

931
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,359
specifically when

932
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,640
when you

933
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,720
send the invite that

934
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,640
you're you're

935
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
you support that and whether or not the

936
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,119
far side should put in a reason center

937
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,040
so i think slightly different topic but

938
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,800
um

939
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,040
so technical apology here i've just lost

940
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,480
a network connection

941
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,640
and i'm the one who's running the slides

942
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,480
so oh it's coming back let's see if i

943
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,119
can get it back up there

944
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,839
nope

945
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,200
okay here we go

946
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,480
yes

947
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,440
thank you

948
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,320
um okay next comment uh this is from

949
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,920
paul

950
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,330
um

951
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,160
[Music]

952
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,480
and i guess robert's probably the most

953
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,079
relevant person to talk about this

954
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,000
whether or not we should

955
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,520
uh finish

956
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,440
multiple reasons or i think paul

957
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,839
specifically was saying have it at least

958
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,720
get to working group last call before we

959
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,880
move on with this uh going to working

960
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,200
group groups well yeah this is robert i

961
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,800
think that's silly

962
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,000
um

963
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,320
i wish paul were here

964
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,280
um

965
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,119
we've already got mechanisms for

966
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,680
normative dependencies um

967
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,359
making the right thing happen before

968
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,359
things moved to rfc and i don't think

969
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,040
this is going to be a high controversy

970
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,280
thing that would cause this particular

971
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,599
draft to have to change

972
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,359
um as that one is is moving through if

973
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,440
it turns out to not be true you know

974
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
things going to be part waiting for it

975
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,520
anyhow so you know it can always be a

976
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,560
yank

977
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,320
so i think we should just go ahead and

978
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,359
let the um

979
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,480
process

980
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,680
move forward for this draft while the

981
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,119
the other one proceeds now i'll

982
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,920
apologize on multiple reasons i missed

983
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,079
brian's call for

984
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,079
the zip core working group zero zero at

985
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,599
the beginning of june i didn't see it

986
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,079
until i was preparing for this minute um

987
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,079
that's in now i'll have a zero one in

988
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,320
shortly that actually addresses all the

989
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,000
feedback so far

990
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,720
and i fully expect that we'll um i'll be

991
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,880
pushing subcore to working group last

992
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,760
call

993
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,480
multiple reasons um

994
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,119
before august is over so this it's not

995
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,200
like this is going to be a

996
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
big blocking thing that we have to wait

997
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,000
for

998
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,960
a long time on

999
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,320
okay yeah this is richard i just want to

1000
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,040
add and chris i don't know

1001
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,560
whether you want to incorporate it or

1002
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,000
not but remember reason codes may or may

1003
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,680
not have privacy implications

1004
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,200
and i've already seen this in 607 608

1005
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,880
and 603

1006
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,000
is whether or not you want to add

1007
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,560
there may well be some considerations

1008
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,800
here or just skip it but

1009
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,000
these do these kinds of issues do come

1010
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,960
up

1011
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,079
with

1012
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,960
verbose explanations of why you're doing

1013
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,480
a particular activity

1014
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,040
yeah i think the identified privacy

1015
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,920
issue was that we included the full

1016
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,720
passport that had you know

1017
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:02,980
uh

1018
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,240
[Music]

1019
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,920
you know the call the originating number

1020
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,079
and destination number

1021
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,280
um we've addressed that by recommending

1022
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,800
compact form

1023
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,359
so i think that's the only thing that

1024
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,760
could potentially be an issue there

1025
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,640
or at least that's come up as an issue

1026
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,480
so i think we're okay

1027
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,960
with that one

1028
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,079
uh next one is

1029
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,079
being more explicit about the use case

1030
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,280
for multiple errors or maybe even having

1031
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,680
an explicit constraint on

1032
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,839
only having a single cause code for each

1033
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,320
ppi

1034
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,400
um

1035
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,359
i think

1036
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,760
the rules for that

1037
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,680
and the guidance in 8224 is to only

1038
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,640
really there can only be one cause code

1039
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,720
for an error from an identity header so

1040
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,800
i guess the question is

1041
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,359
would there ever be a case

1042
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,230
that there is multiple cause codes

1043
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,359
[Music]

1044
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,160
or or if there is do we want to restrict

1045
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,480
that in the future

1046
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,640
yeah i mean this john peterson sorry and

1047
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,079
i'm not using the q thing at all i

1048
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,839
should be better

1049
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,720
um

1050
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,880
yeah i mean the the constraint that's in

1051
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,880
rfc 224 really we intended that cause

1052
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,960
codes sip cause codes sent in backwards

1053
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,079
direction

1054
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,319
hopefully indicate repairable conditions

1055
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,839
right it's giving you information you

1056
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,599
could use to reoriginate this request

1057
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,440
and this time use a trust anchor that's

1058
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,520
supported by the other side or you know

1059
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,119
fix whatever your syntactical problem is

1060
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,640
or something like that

1061
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:38,900
um

1062
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,000
[Music]

1063
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
i mean prima facie there could be a ton

1064
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,960
of things that are wrong with any given

1065
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,720
like you know passport and invite that

1066
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,960
you get that would you know potentially

1067
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,200
necessitate multiple such

1068
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,440
cause codes being applicable

1069
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,359
i i guess i viewed it like you would do

1070
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,000
it onesie twozy but

1071
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,920
you know

1072
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,760
so i mean i mean i would be fine because

1073
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,160
this is the decision we made in 824 was

1074
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,760
effectively you know you're gonna have a

1075
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,720
single

1076
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,280
um expression of something that's wrong

1077
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,040
that needs to be fixed that you're

1078
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,240
sending back that's a reason for

1079
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,480
rejecting it it's also important to note

1080
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,319
there can be like cascading conditions

1081
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,760
like okay this is what i thought was

1082
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,079
wrong and so i rejected it at this vs

1083
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,920
for this reason then you send it through

1084
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,599
and it's going to go to some further

1085
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,280
element that will have some different

1086
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,480
problem with it that'll result in a

1087
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,240
different cause code being sent so i'm

1088
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,400
not even sure that it's possible to try

1089
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,160
to consolidate what all the multiple

1090
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,760
potential errors are associated with

1091
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,839
these things simply because it's an

1092
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,200
orchestrated service right yeah um so

1093
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,040
i'd be fine with with having that

1094
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,680
constraint but i also think it would it

1095
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,880
would probably be okay if you want to

1096
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,720
have multiple ones if you are aware of

1097
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
multiple ones there's no

1098
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,040
you know there's no no particular reason

1099
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,760
not to communicate all them

1100
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,240
so like yeah i was sort of taking the

1101
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,400
tact of like it's sort of already

1102
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,319
constrained based on the cause codes

1103
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,520
that i already defined but um

1104
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,599
so no change is necessary and we don't

1105
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,560
know what's going to happen in the

1106
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,640
future to your point of

1107
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,480
cascading things or other things like

1108
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,200
that

1109
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,440
orchestrated services so i i mean i

1110
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,800
guess for the sake of simplicity which

1111
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,040
is usually the right decision to make i

1112
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,759
would do single

1113
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,560
so make that change

1114
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,720
is what you're suggesting

1115
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,880
okay i mean like i said if this one can

1116
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,720
go either way if you'd rather not change

1117
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,640
it i'm i'm just saying like that's this

1118
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,920
is what we made in issue 24.

1119
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,680
okay

1120
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,960
yeah i can make that change

1121
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,319
um next one should we not remove the

1122
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,000
reason header but only remove ppi

1123
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,319
um

1124
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,240
and this is only for the case of full

1125
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,560
form

1126
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,760
so at

1127
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,800
um

1128
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,600
i understand the request

1129
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,940
[Music]

1130
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,599
it allows for full form i guess maybe

1131
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,880
that gets back to the question of

1132
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,960
whether or not we think full form

1133
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,079
will or should be used

1134
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,480
i guess i'm curious about precedent for

1135
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
this one as well

1136
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,240
i'm removing a parameter versus

1137
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,720
a header and this is this is on the

1138
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,880
backwards direction from the ais to just

1139
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,119
to be clear

1140
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,319
well i mean again it makes sense to

1141
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,720
remove it for

1142
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,959
uh

1143
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,119
ppi and only for full form not for

1144
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,440
compact form right so

1145
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,119
ppi is the

1146
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,200
parameter that holds the yeah the

1147
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,480
passport

1148
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,280
so

1149
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,520
i think what paul is saying is instead

1150
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,839
of removing the entire reason header

1151
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,359
let the reason header with the cause

1152
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,040
code go

1153
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,440
but remove the identifying information

1154
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,040
if it's fulfilled only if it's full form

1155
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,920
yeah that makes sense

1156
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,720
i don't mind putting that guidance in

1157
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,200
especially if i'm making changes uh jack

1158
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,640
um

1159
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,960
i guess my question is why what's the

1160
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
benefit of only removing ppi and only

1161
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,119
for full form is there any harmon just

1162
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,480
removing the whole thing all the time

1163
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,800
i mean the the point is just you can get

1164
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,319
away with it for compact form because

1165
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,680
you're not licking the information but

1166
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,640
you are liking it in full form

1167
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,240
i

1168
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,000
i i would have the same question you

1169
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,119
know

1170
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,920
is it useful information for upstream

1171
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,800
from the as that signed it

1172
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,839
to know that there was an error that

1173
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:04,880
happened

1174
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,200
you know

1175
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,680
without the identifying information but

1176
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,160
like i guess that could be

1177
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,960
if you if we want to

1178
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,119
flush out the logic of that you know do

1179
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,720
we need to describe

1180
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,720
why that happened and and all that good

1181
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,720
stuff so there are other dialogue

1182
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,160
matching indicators and a safe

1183
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,599
transaction then

1184
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,680
presence of the password but

1185
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,520
yeah

1186
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,599
now roman seems to be in queue what's up

1187
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,640
herman

1188
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,640
i'm just thinking probably better to

1189
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,319
remove it because

1190
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,160
that way if you have a feature

1191
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,319
implemented somewhere down the line from

1192
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,359
like some device like there is a there

1193
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,280
is something which is signing and then

1194
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,280
it's getting back to reason to move the

1195
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,160
reason passes this thing through and

1196
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,680
essentially whatever is the device

1197
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,680
upstream is not going to see

1198
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,359
any of the

1199
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,599
store reasons or any of the new features

1200
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,680
so it's kind of like makes it nice and

1201
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,839
contained

1202
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,119
to the device which actually is

1203
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,800
implementing store versus we're just

1204
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,680
passing some reasons with the new

1205
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,160
uh reason pro with a new reason protocol

1206
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,160
somewhere upstream to a device which

1207
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,720
otherwise had uh doesn't know and you

1208
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,119
care about any of that

1209
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,520
so that's why my reason for removing it

1210
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,079
completely versus just removing the ppi

1211
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,920
yeah yeah i think that's actually a

1212
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,160
really good point like you know if you

1213
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,319
get the reason header with stir and you

1214
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,240
don't have a ppi you don't know what to

1215
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,400
do so i guess back to my comment of like

1216
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,079
um

1217
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,400
do we do we is that even a use case that

1218
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,640
we care about and want to give the

1219
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,440
details of um i i sort of

1220
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,920
yeah maybe might have a stronger opinion

1221
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,520
about just removing the reason matter i

1222
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,560
mean the whole point of compact

1223
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,680
performance you can always match that

1224
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,880
against the original passport you

1225
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,319
generated right

1226
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,440
so that's always

1227
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,760
but theoretically that you know if you

1228
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,680
remove it at the as that generated the

1229
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,000
passport

1230
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,760
the upstream

1231
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,079
as that might interpret the reason

1232
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,119
header

1233
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,880
won't even know about that

1234
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,319
leg of the call

1235
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,040
well yeah okay again if in orchestration

1236
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,800
you have multiple layers of vases and

1237
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,640
like one prior removes it and then you

1238
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,400
leave the recent header in that doesn't

1239
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,720
make sense but like i assume yeah i

1240
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,920
assume you should remove the entire

1241
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,200
reason header if you're the a.s that's

1242
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,319
consuming it right i think i think right

1243
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,800
that's that's i think that's

1244
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,400
complementary with what

1245
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,280
roman said um you can come back on if

1246
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,520
not but uh

1247
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,200
i certainly agree with that point any

1248
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,319
other comments there

1249
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,319
are we okay with where we landed

1250
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,839
okay um

1251
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,480
last one

1252
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,839
uh should we be more specific to only

1253
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,240
allow stir specific cause codes and not

1254
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,240
other sip

1255
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,559
and the parenthetical is my

1256
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,200
statement i think yes

1257
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,400
um

1258
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
what about future proofing for nuster

1259
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,119
cause codes

1260
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,319
is 603 a stir specific cause code

1261
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,200
well i mean maybe it is now but it's

1262
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,040
certainly in rc30 g61 right

1263
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,000
um

1264
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,599
[Music]

1265
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,319
and so 607 and 608 i think we agree or

1266
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,319
we formally think what are the cause

1267
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,359
codes

1268
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:47,279
well six or three divine right

1269
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,920
and now it sucks up like plus well yeah

1270
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,920
well but well like

1271
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,240
you're asked a little bit shockey yeah

1272
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,800
you're asking about extensibility here

1273
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,559
uh in terms of cause codes and

1274
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,119
sure i mean that's what we always do and

1275
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,000
you know

1276
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,240
608 and that abomination 607.

1277
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,119
i'll go we don't need to go there but

1278
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,240
uh

1279
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,760
yeah sure

1280
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,640
maybe

1281
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,480
how extensive and

1282
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,800
how extensive do you want

1283
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,359
extensibility yeah

1284
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,160
well i think for 603 plus that's defined

1285
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:29,119
as either sip or q850

1286
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,960
so i think

1287
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,680
that doesn't isn't applicable here as

1288
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,079
long as that's you know it doesn't

1289
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,280
change

1290
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,720
so i think for stir going forward

1291
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,920
um

1292
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,240
you know any future start we we want it

1293
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,119
to continue to

1294
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,839
uh support those new stir cause codes if

1295
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,720
they get created right

1296
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,160
and hopefully they'll have this as a

1297
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,760
reference to make sure that there's no

1298
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,680
issues i guess i would enumerate the

1299
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,920
cost codes we mean so i assume you mean

1300
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,000
by stir specific cause codes are the

1301
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,400
ones identified the h24

1302
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,160
plus ones that are identified in

1303
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,559
subsequent specifications that are

1304
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,480
aligned with stir yeah plus 603

1305
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,300
maybe plus 403

1306
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,960
[Music]

1307
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,040
i think what i have in there and i would

1308
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,880
need to verify that but i believe i do

1309
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,599
reference 8224 as the

1310
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,480
and i think i do say in future

1311
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,280
stir related

1312
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:30,720
um

1313
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,240
hopefully i'm saying that correctly

1314
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,400
but i think for sip

1315
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,480
that should just follow

1316
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,280
sip

1317
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,440
and q850

1318
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,599
rules of the specification so i think

1319
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,559
that's a different context

1320
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,880
i mean i know it's related to things you

1321
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,520
know

1322
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,680
does that mean that if a new response

1323
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,079
code is defined that it thinks it should

1324
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,520
be easter related it should say hey i'm

1325
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,800
still related so i apply here

1326
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,640
that says in that future specification

1327
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,559
well i don't know maybe this

1328
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,040
specification is establishing that i

1329
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,319
mean it establishes stir as a protocol

1330
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,440
i just mean that

1331
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,440
if a future response code wants to be in

1332
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,520
this category it can specify when it's

1333
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,520
defined because yes i'm also in this

1334
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,880
category so it's the same thing as all

1335
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,319
the other ones that's what i'm playing

1336
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,319
here

1337
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,359
does that make sense

1338
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,920
for everyone

1339
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,839
yeah that would be good

1340
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,559
um well john's reading that so i think

1341
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,319
what the action item is

1342
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,319
um

1343
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,319
yeah so on bullet uh three

1344
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:01,359
um

1345
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,359
being explicit about only allowing a

1346
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,319
single cause code

1347
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,200
and

1348
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,000
for bullet four

1349
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,960
no change i guess right we decided to

1350
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,839
keep

1351
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:16,839
reason

1352
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,558
header removal

1353
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,359
yes i mean this john again the way i

1354
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,760
read section four i would i think we're

1355
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,079
gonna need to name at least a couple

1356
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,640
like other status codes that are in the

1357
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,000
scope of this like 603.

1358
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,480
but do we want them to use

1359
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,559
switch to stir as a protocol i don't

1360
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,800
think so

1361
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,119
yeah i mean i see i think i see what the

1362
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,280
use case is for it

1363
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,599
but um i mean again i mean

1364
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,839
because effectively the use case is i

1365
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,040
know that this number is supposed to be

1366
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,359
signed and this number is not signed

1367
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,359
how do i know it it's a metascope way

1368
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,480
right

1369
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,559
is is another way to think about it and

1370
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,960
maybe clarification that

1371
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,559
these are reason headers that are

1372
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,280
intended for consumption by the

1373
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,880
authentication service specifically

1374
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,839
uh yeah yeah i think i think that would

1375
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,839
probably work

1376
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:22,960
again with

1377
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,280
that that are both consumable by and

1378
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,599
presumably repairable by or at least the

1379
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,040
only thing the only thing that would

1380
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,800
help is if the authentication service

1381
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,880
repaired it right right that's the kind

1382
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,839
of things we're trying to express yes

1383
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,640
i can clarify that

1384
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,960
um

1385
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,920
i can make some fairly quick changes for

1386
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,720
those

1387
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,160
items

1388
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,160
and maybe we can discuss on the list i

1389
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,680
guess

1390
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,760
just to make sure we get

1391
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,880
good feedback on those items

1392
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,599
i forget what i had on the last slide i

1393
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,040
think it was just uh generic

1394
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,240
yeah i was figuring i was figuring we'd

1395
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,240
need another round but i but again i

1396
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,240
could i could do that fairly quickly

1397
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,760
you'll at least want another round and

1398
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,359
then we can give people a chance to see

1399
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:38,000
it there right comment the results yeah

1400
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,599
think it can be settled on the list

1401
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,079
hopefully

1402
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,640
i think we had general agreement in the

1403
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,839
room here at least so

1404
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,040
thank you

1405
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,280
okay

1406
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,000
ocsp

1407
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,559
we are totally going to finish early

1408
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,040
today which is awesome we can go we

1409
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,400
asked for two hours for like the first

1410
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,680
time in

1411
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,200
several meetings and we kept running

1412
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,160
over and now we're not going to make it

1413
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,359
this is different

1414
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,119
entirely laziness

1415
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,040
part and chris's part for not upping

1416
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,480
other specs that should have been up for

1417
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,520
this

1418
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,720
um

1419
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,440
oh yeah let's talk about ocsp wow this

1420
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,040
is so exciting

1421
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,359
and this goes back to the heavy days of

1422
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,319
the development of rfc 8226 the place

1423
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,640
where you defined how to do certificates

1424
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,760
firster slide please

1425
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,040
and like

1426
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,920
you know at the time we had this notion

1427
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,000
probably we need some kind of real-time

1428
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,559
freshness check for these certificates

1429
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,920
and that the check would be a little

1430
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,640
different than what you're used to

1431
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,960
in ordinary like web pki or something

1432
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,480
why is that it's because the

1433
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,960
certificates that we defined in a226

1434
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,119
have this new field that's called a tn

1435
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,920
off list and the tn office can be it can

1436
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,680
contain a couple different kinds of

1437
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,760
identifiers one of the things we call

1438
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,200
service provider codes which are

1439
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,880
basically in north america these fancy

1440
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,720
codes that like identify who carriers

1441
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,520
are

1442
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,119
another thing they could take could

1443
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,359
contain are telephone numbers or lists

1444
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,359
of telephone numbers and these are like

1445
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,520
baked into the search themselves so that

1446
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,440
when you're signing for a call with the

1447
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,280
cert you have some sense of like what

1448
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,440
the scope of authority is of the signing

1449
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,359
entity

1450
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,119
and so there's an issue with that though

1451
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,119
when you start doing telephone numbers

1452
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,960
and baking them in desserts the problem

1453
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,559
is people's ownership of telephone

1454
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,640
numbers it's kind of dynamic there's all

1455
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,000
these factors like local number

1456
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,400
portability or you know we can make up

1457
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,359
like a million other reasons why um the

1458
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,920
a list that at one point in time was

1459
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,079
accurate is like a little different at a

1460
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,000
later point in time

1461
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,440
and so of course you could just issue

1462
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,319
new certs like all the time um you know

1463
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,319
we like the cachability properties of

1464
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,319
certificates at verification services in

1465
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,160
stir so we don't exactly want to put

1466
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,720
that burden entirely on relying parties

1467
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,960
and so instead we thought wouldn't it be

1468
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,720
great if there was some way we could

1469
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,640
build something into these certs where

1470
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,240
you could kind of ask hey is this

1471
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,079
particular telephone number because if

1472
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,440
you're a verification service you just

1473
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,839
got a call right call comes from some

1474
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,000
particular calling party number and the

1475
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,200
only thing you really want to know at

1476
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,480
that moment is

1477
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,720
should the entity that sign for this

1478
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,240
call

1479
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,640
be able to vouch for this number

1480
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,839
and so i asked ross and sean turner who

1481
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,760
i don't believe could join us today

1482
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,119
what's the right way to do that we

1483
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,480
talked about a whole bunch of ways to do

1484
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,599
that

1485
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:38,799
today we're going to talk a little bit

1486
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,559
about one of them which is ocsp

1487
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,520
we added this ocsp extension to the

1488
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,040
original uh draft version of 8226 that

1489
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,000
basically contained a url in it that you

1490
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,920
know you could you know

1491
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,480
ocsp extension in it you could use that

1492
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,960
would then let you be able to inquire

1493
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,680
with ocsp just pass fail this particular

1494
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,760
tn is it in scope of the cert or not get

1495
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,799
back a yes or a no answer

1496
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,400
ultimately we decided when we were doing

1497
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,559
rfc

1498
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:13,040
2082-26 we didn't like have enough uh

1499
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,200
incentive frankly to include that

1500
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,359
mechanism or initially in the scope of

1501
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,559
this work

1502
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,799
a lot of people are using crls because a

1503
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,960
lot of people are using uh service

1504
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,280
provider codes these spcs the great

1505
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,799
thing about having what speaking to your

1506
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,040
search be just like i'm etnt or i'm

1507
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,359
orange or i'm joyce telecom

1508
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:32,880
is that you're not worrying about that

1509
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,280
like individual level number stuff

1510
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,359
and so you know basically whether they

1511
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:38,880
assign port or nods whether you trust

1512
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,559
att or orange or who whoever

1513
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
but now we're actually starting to get

1514
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,079
into certificate delegation

1515
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,400
into the idea you might have an entity

1516
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,160
like an enterprise that owns like a

1517
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,839
couple thousand blocks or that owns like

1518
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:54,079
specific number ranges they're not a

1519
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,760
carrier they don't have these fancy

1520
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,160
identifiers that carriers have

1521
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,520
and you know as we've looked at the

1522
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,520
security model of this both in the iitf

1523
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,520
and in addis and in other adjacent

1524
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,119
places

1525
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,440
we've decided maybe it's time to revisit

1526
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,920
this ocsp idea

1527
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,480
next slide

1528
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,960
so like i had a draft about this that we

1529
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,200
broke off from 8226 back in the day and

1530
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,640
that

1531
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,799
could be next slide

1532
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,040
sorry

1533
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,520
and that draft uh kind of languished um

1534
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,400
you know as 8226 went forward but

1535
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,839
was originally a working group item

1536
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,000
because it was a child draft of uh what

1537
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,119
became 8226 but it basically showed like

1538
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,960
a model where yeah you're going to have

1539
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,480
like some ability to do certificate

1540
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,559
validation that will query back to the

1541
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,400
logical authority typically to the ca

1542
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,839
that issued the serp

1543
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,680
to get that real time check on the

1544
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,599
verification service side

1545
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:52,880
for both

1546
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,079
standard ocn sign calls like you see on

1547
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,480
the lower left hand side of the slide

1548
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,680
but most interesting in the middle of

1549
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,799
this like enterprise delegation case

1550
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,280
excellent

1551
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,119
now you know there is one open issue i

1552
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,559
want to talk about today and this is the

1553
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,079
major thing you will see that is

1554
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,680
different from the current draft of this

1555
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,760
from the last one we've talked about two

1556
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,680
ways of approaching this and these ways

1557
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,200
model how tls has utilized ocsp in the

1558
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,160
past

1559
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,079
to either have this query by the relying

1560
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,599
party on the terminating side in our

1561
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,760
case the verification service or to

1562
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,040
staple it

1563
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,200
and what is stapling entails stapling

1564
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,520
entails that on the originating side and

1565
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,200
the signing side

1566
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,280
somebody would go and get or maybe have

1567
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,880
pushed to them

1568
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,079
beforehand

1569
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,440
um you know a little piece of

1570
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,920
cryptography that basically assures you

1571
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,960
the ca that issued the cert believes you

1572
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,680
know

1573
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,000
basically what the osp response ocsp

1574
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
response would have been if you went and

1575
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,280
asked on the terminating side you're

1576
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,440
just going to pre-generate that and ship

1577
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,520
it along with the passport to reach the

1578
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,599
termination side

1579
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,839
and this is really cool and there are

1580
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:04,559
some trade-offs around it that

1581
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,240
are beneficial for privacy and a bunch

1582
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,400
of other things but my proposal here

1583
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,680
today is let's not do that yet

1584
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,839
let's just define the way to do the

1585
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,280
terminating side query the standard

1586
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,119
modality of ocsp

1587
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,359
and worrying about the stapling later

1588
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,280
the main reason being otherwise we can

1589
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,079
kind of bolt ocsp on to what we're

1590
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,160
already doing pretty easily it's like

1591
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,520
just something on the terminating side

1592
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,119
that incrementally some people can

1593
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,799
decide to do or not if they have the

1594
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,520
capability to go and do this step get it

1595
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,160
to the ca get back their answer

1596
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,000
but like actually getting authentication

1597
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,240
services to acquire these staples

1598
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,839
building in the protocol machinery for

1599
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:44,400
those staples to be sent across

1600
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,160
it seems like a heavy lift out of the

1601
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,040
gate

1602
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,799
and i'd rather kick the tires and

1603
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:49,839
whether people are actually going to use

1604
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,760
this at all especially in like north

1605
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,240
american stir shaken before we start

1606
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,640
looking at optimizations like doing this

1607
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,839
for um

1608
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,240
for stapling and like

1609
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,079
i'd also add we're

1610
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,680
separately exploring using short-lived

1611
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,520
search for this purpose that will build

1612
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,760
on like acme and stuff like that

1613
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,119
the properties of stapling and

1614
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:10,799
short-lived certs start to look real

1615
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,640
real similar right

1616
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,960
and it may be you know we'll say that if

1617
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,839
you want to push this to the originating

1618
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,599
side it might be better to do that with

1619
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:20,960
short-lived certs than to do it with

1620
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,720
stapling

1621
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,839
so i want to talk about that though does

1622
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,599
anybody have any feelings about this if

1623
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,640
we punted on doing stapling for now

1624
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,039
would anybody here or on the virtual

1625
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,599
world barf or that

1626
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,680
any thoughts

1627
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,919
yeah

1628
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,200
what's

1629
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,880
the

1630
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,200
point of this without stapling as in

1631
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,359
you you said the like kind of one of the

1632
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,039
benefits of politics at the moment is

1633
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,200
that they're very cachable

1634
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,280
um which speeds up verification but if

1635
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,760
you have to do an os ocsp

1636
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,119
dig every time

1637
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,599
then that kind of negates the point of

1638
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,440
that and you might as well just download

1639
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,839
a certificate

1640
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,480
yeah well i mean so there's a difference

1641
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,200
between ocsp and downloading assert

1642
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,039
especially if what's in the cert is

1643
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,799
really complicated i mean as as you

1644
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,079
probably aware jack a lot of this

1645
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,920
discussion on the out attic side is

1646
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,079
about people who don't want to do tn by

1647
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,799
reference right where the aia field

1648
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:23,039
contains url to a potentially massive

1649
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,880
list of numbers that are supported in

1650
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,280
the cert and this is being offered up as

1651
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,599
a sacrificial lamb to prevent that from

1652
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:30,400
happening

1653
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,280
right where instead of having like a

1654
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,079
massive list that's insert of the tns

1655
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,440
that are associated with some enterprise

1656
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,960
that owns half a million numbers or

1657
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,079
something

1658
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,640
um both for the sake of not revealing

1659
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,720
those numbers like the whole set of them

1660
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,240
to relying parties

1661
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,720
and for the sake of just making the

1662
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,280
actual cost of doing this rtt lower

1663
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,440
why not just use scsp do the single

1664
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,960
query saying like is this number in

1665
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,839
scope and get back up pass fail

1666
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,079
it's really about is this more optimal

1667
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,520
than the other

1668
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,038
paths that we're considering for this

1669
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,799
because like i was happy to do tn by ref

1670
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,920
right i mean that's all in 8226 already

1671
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,319
and if your telephone number list is

1672
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,520
very simple

1673
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,240
and you aren't concerned about you know

1674
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,079
a relying party learning what the total

1675
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,680
set of numbers are that the certificate

1676
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,240
has a scope of authority for like you

1677
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,960
know tn bireftist works then largely

1678
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,280
people in addis pushing back on that and

1679
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,559
saying like no that's completely

1680
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,720
unacceptable that has like led us to

1681
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,839
want to do this with ocsp

1682
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,880
that that discussion actually ended up

1683
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,680
in an

1684
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,760
interesting place well the last time

1685
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,880
i was involved was actually ended up

1686
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,920
with everyone going byref probably isn't

1687
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,359
what we want

1688
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,720
we probably want something that looks

1689
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,520
more like ocsp or short-lived certs

1690
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,680
and the discussion actually went towards

1691
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,920
like ocsp is basically identical to

1692
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,440
short-lived certs and we already know

1693
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,839
how to do trouble assets so

1694
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,599
we should probably go

1695
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:07,920
think about that not that any thinking

1696
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,079
then happened as far as i'm aware yeah i

1697
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,200
mean on the bottom of the slide you'll

1698
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,559
see me saying we're to continue to

1699
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,880
explore the shirt live path separately

1700
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,280
and again i think as i said the the

1701
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,359
properties of stapling and doing

1702
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,039
short-lived search look real real

1703
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,920
similar i mean i think the issue is

1704
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,319
doing short-lived circuits the best way

1705
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:29,359
we needed we know to do that is acme

1706
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,000
and like that's an even heavier lift

1707
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,520
than any other development thing that

1708
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,160
we're entertaining to this

1709
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,960
yeah um i i guess um the main thing i

1710
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,960
was going to say was that

1711
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,640
i would be surprised if anyone used this

1712
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,039
without stapling because it doesn't give

1713
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,039
any obvious benefits when you have

1714
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,240
stapling it something gives you an

1715
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,520
obvious benefit but without stapling

1716
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,960
i would be surprised if anyone used it

1717
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,200
okay

1718
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,400
this is chris so can i ask jack

1719
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,079
is your point about round trips

1720
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,280
i assume about cash abilities

1721
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,400
yeah yeah

1722
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,640
round trips cash ability that stuff yeah

1723
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,720
okay i mean you can still cash the cert

1724
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,799
right yeah this isn't a cert caching

1725
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,799
problem there's just you eating the rtt

1726
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:22,079
of ocsp on on everything but again like

1727
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,520
getting a short you know

1728
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,160
stapling requires the same thing on the

1729
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,160
authentication service side right

1730
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,240
it's just a matter of like which side

1731
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,720
pays the cost

1732
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,839
well and my comment was going to be um

1733
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:39,599
you brought up tn by ref

1734
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,640
is your point that

1735
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,799
inserting and removing

1736
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:50,960
tns from uh tm by ref is like

1737
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,760
uh

1738
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,240
revoking the ability for that tn to be

1739
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,720
covered by that cert

1740
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,920
that's the equivalence that you're

1741
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,200
making yeah

1742
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,640
yeah because i was going to say that

1743
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,880
they were for two different

1744
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,200
use cases but i but i think maybe that's

1745
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,880
what you're implying that we could use

1746
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,920
those properties to cover those things

1747
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,440
yeah i mean i think i think that the

1748
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,799
short strands for me there's no such

1749
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,960
thing as a free lunch right like there's

1750
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,400
there's really so many moving pieces

1751
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,079
between these alternatives between doing

1752
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,240
tn by ref doing ocsp and doing

1753
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,599
short-lived certs

1754
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:24,000
and like ocsb has the further

1755
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,440
issue of

1756
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,319
you know

1757
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,960
do you do it stapled or not and like my

1758
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,720
point is just we kind of know how to do

1759
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,039
this i think we have a better idea of

1760
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,720
how to do this

1761
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,359
without stapling than with it in the

1762
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,359
sense of what does it look like with

1763
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,359
stapling so this is every authentication

1764
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,119
service has a connection to a ca it's

1765
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,720
going to issue them these staples right

1766
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,240
there's a push or pull

1767
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,319
i assume that it's paul right in the

1768
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:51,119
sense of asses are going to dip the ca

1769
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,520
get the staple and then send it to the

1770
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,000
vs unless they can anticipate what those

1771
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,839
staples are gonna need are in advance

1772
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,599
this is exactly the same hit to call

1773
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,440
processing as it is to do it on the

1774
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,359
verification service side

1775
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,280
it's just a question of like you know

1776
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,119
who does it

1777
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,920
and so i mean i i i'm correct

1778
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,839
is there some like benefit to doing it

1779
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,760
on the aside versus the vsi that i'm

1780
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,319
missing or

1781
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,679
like the staples need to come from the

1782
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,679
same place right

1783
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,640
as the vs responses to csp do

1784
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,319
and i just want to clarify on the short

1785
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,839
term sir you're looking at that as

1786
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:33,120
mutually exclusive in other words

1787
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,359
with those csp

1788
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,439
you have a long term cert

1789
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,600
and you're using ocsp as the mechanism

1790
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,960
to

1791
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,439
revoke it in freshness yeah okay and i'm

1792
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,679
not saying let's not do service i'm just

1793
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,279
saying as far as i know that means doing

1794
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,319
acme

1795
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,479
and like that you know or at least that

1796
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,560
is the best way we know to do that

1797
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,560
and we've tried to get acme down

1798
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,000
people's throats in this forever and

1799
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,719
it's been like a real a real problem i

1800
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,719
mean russ can you

1801
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,319
is there anything you can fill in for me

1802
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,080
am i am i adequately describing the

1803
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,880
trade-off for ocsp versus stapled and

1804
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,040
not in terms of how the rtt costs are

1805
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,158
paid except for one thing um

1806
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,158
and that is

1807
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:18,238
ocsp includes a next update field

1808
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,640
and so you can cache

1809
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,719
between uses

1810
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,439
of if you're validating the same cert on

1811
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,679
the verification side correct yeah i'm

1812
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,040
pretty sad yeah

1813
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,319
i guess that's true too so you can think

1814
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,000
about like staples have an expiry and so

1815
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,238
they can be at least briefly correct yes

1816
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,359
but i mean the fundamental point i'm

1817
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,080
making is the rtt cost is paid on one

1818
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,000
side or the other and unless you can

1819
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
anticipate on the asi the numbers you're

1820
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,080
going to need to get staples for there

1821
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,560
there is no rtt gain from stapling

1822
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,799
versus not it that will have exactly the

1823
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:52,560
same like call processing impact

1824
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,000
so

1825
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,880
um i think it's you mentioned about that

1826
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,719
short-lived chart

1827
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,360
can be achieved the acme drops right

1828
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,640
which is

1829
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,719
tn authority token

1830
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,960
right am i correct so the short lift sir

1831
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,600
is achieved by manufacturing the certs

1832
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,480
on the as side this is not done in real

1833
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,080
time call processing right this is

1834
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,120
something you do offline like once a day

1835
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,960
or once an hour once a minute once a

1836
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,320
call i guess if you wanted but let's

1837
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,080
pretend you're gonna do it once a day

1838
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,080
right and so you only pay that cost for

1839
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,520
generating the short-lived cert once a

1840
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,840
day and so it does not impact call

1841
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,679
processing where you do pay the cost for

1842
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,159
that is in cash ability of the cert on

1843
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:36,080
the verification service side because

1844
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,600
the more frequently you update it the

1845
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,199
more frequently the vs is going to have

1846
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:42,080
to execute you know dereference the x5u

1847
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,440
and actually get a new server to

1848
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,040
validate passports

1849
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,520
and so the overall cost of that or less

1850
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,120
like and there's certainly less for call

1851
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,239
processing

1852
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,800
but like the what you know the cost

1853
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,120
you're paying there is doing acme star

1854
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,400
or like whatever it is you're going to

1855
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,520
do that's actually going to get you

1856
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,920
those short-lived certs

1857
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,760
okay so

1858
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,320
one other point i was thinking that how

1859
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,760
often

1860
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,239
these numbers are actually

1861
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:11,280
revoked or not valid for an enterprise

1862
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,920
right so that is also and maybe an

1863
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,400
important factor right to consider but

1864
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,080
there's a ton of entropy i mean again

1865
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,199
it's it's

1866
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,280
any given number could be revoked at any

1867
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,960
given time or leave the scope of

1868
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,239
certificate of something at any given

1869
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,480
time i mean my company new stars had a

1870
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,800
bunch of telephone numbers and uh the

1871
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,280
plus one five seven one four three four

1872
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,600
like 20 years right no nothing ever goes

1873
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,880
in or out of that they're just our

1874
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,800
numbers so sometimes these things are

1875
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,320
super static

1876
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,600
but then there are some enterprises for

1877
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,120
which it's actually quite dynamic

1878
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,120
especially when you look at things like

1879
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,920
um non-carrier entities that are cpas

1880
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,080
providers you know people that have very

1881
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,400
complex number allocations that involve

1882
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,760
lots of porting in and out and things

1883
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,239
like that but they aren't quite carriers

1884
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:56,159
like that stuff is just brutal and it's

1885
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,520
really those kinds of use cases that

1886
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,679
motivate us for this okay and the last

1887
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,480
one is that say for example if this is

1888
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,000
in place right

1889
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,480
then do we still need that

1890
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,120
the short-lived mechanisms which acne

1891
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,679
can provide or we can solve this with

1892
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,040
this one so i i at this point i'm not

1893
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,360
counseling that we abandon

1894
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,480
that path

1895
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,080
i say let's keep looking at it let's

1896
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,320
look at this i think this is kind of

1897
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,159
easier to do which is why i'm presenting

1898
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,320
this today and not short-lived there is

1899
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,800
a short-lived draft it you know at least

1900
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,560
lays out what the major parts of this

1901
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,040
are this the fruit of this looks more

1902
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,280
low-hanging to me than any others and we

1903
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,840
need something i think to cover the

1904
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,080
delegation cases that are now more and

1905
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,040
more in the wild uh firster shaken okay

1906
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,360
i think

1907
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,120
uh jonathan i mean i just

1908
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,960
i'll say first to reply someone comment

1909
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,080
on that and then

1910
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,600
something i actually have to say i think

1911
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,120
the

1912
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,320
question important question is not how

1913
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,760
often does it change but how quickly

1914
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,760
does it change how soon do you know how

1915
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,840
soon you need to say yes this is dead

1916
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,440
after you know it's done you know which

1917
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,600
is basically what you're it's the you

1918
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,239
know dns uh ttl problem

1919
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,000
um but what i was going to say is if

1920
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,679
you're not doing no if you're doing the

1921
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,120
terminating side

1922
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,800
doesn't this and you're putting the tns

1923
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,440
and the oscp queries doesn't mean the ca

1924
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,239
or the ocg verifier gets to know every

1925
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:21,440
number that's

1926
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,080
telephone number that's calling that uh

1927
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,280
vbs

1928
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,960
that seems

1929
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,600
privacy probably yeah so i i

1930
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,040
uh i don't know if i have this on this

1931
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,760
slide in particular but yes it i'm not

1932
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,480
sure it's a privacy issue but it's

1933
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,960
definitely a is leaking information

1934
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,400
about the scope of certificates between

1935
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,400
corporations

1936
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:48,320
so stapling does uh

1937
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,480
largely mitigate that in the sense of

1938
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,080
because it's the authentication side

1939
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,840
that's actually one interacting with the

1940
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,800
ca

1941
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,960
for this you're no longer going to get

1942
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,040
the ip address of the verification

1943
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,199
service that is sending you the ocsp

1944
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,120
query that's definitely a part of this

1945
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,960
uh nonetheless i think it's it's an

1946
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,880
easier path and it's something can like

1947
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,800
be bolted on to this

1948
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,440
again because when you look at it like

1949
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,280
changing the as side

1950
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,320
you know for this then what happens if

1951
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,679
some ases

1952
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,920
implement stapling and some don't

1953
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,760
versus what happens in the vs side of

1954
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,480
this if some vs's implement this and

1955
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,480
some don't right it's really a question

1956
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,719
of you know is the relying party in the

1957
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,719
driver's seat to this or is the a.s in

1958
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,320
the driver's seat of this

1959
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,719
i i you know my analysis of this and

1960
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:36,480
it's an incredibly complicated thing

1961
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,719
across the three options with all their

1962
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,040
sub options or how they can all be done

1963
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,280
is that this this is the easiest thing

1964
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,120
for us to bolt on

1965
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,679
is oscsp on the verification server side

1966
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,440
i don't know is this like where you need

1967
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,679
a hum or something are people okay with

1968
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,480
punting stapling is what i'm interested

1969
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,679
in hearing

1970
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:03,679
from the room group etc

1971
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:09,879
shall we do a raise of hands and medico

1972
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,199
i guess the question would be

1973
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:18,799
is it worth doing ocsp without stapling

1974
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,120
raise your hand if you think it is okay

1975
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,880
it's okay for us to initially specify

1976
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,600
ocsp without stapling john john

1977
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,560
so all you people think it's not okay

1978
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,600
well wait a minute he's still typing

1979
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:44,080
okay so either raise hand or don't or

1980
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,320
click the raise or click the

1981
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,880
um don't raise or

1982
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,480
do neither in which case you're

1983
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,480
abstaining

1984
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:00,639
so if we're only six people care okay

1985
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,000
and you know yeah remember i'm saying

1986
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,920
initially i'm not saying we're not going

1987
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,199
to specify the state plan i'm just

1988
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:08,800
saying that is a lift and it's going to

1989
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,199
take war

1990
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,000
we need the

1991
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,720
game show

1992
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,520
[Music]

1993
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,159
stuff music that

1994
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,000
all right we're gonna wrap this up in

1995
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,120
10

1996
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,000
9

1997
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,800
8

1998
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:34,080
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 dismiss okay so eight

1999
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,120
people

2000
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,679
think that it's fine to do that and two

2001
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:38,960
think it's not

2002
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,640
anyone want to

2003
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,560
anyone want to speak for the

2004
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,560
those two that haven't already yeah who

2005
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,120
who still thinks we should not do this

2006
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,719
unless we do stapling please speak

2007
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,759
okay

2008
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,600
that seems pretty lopsided

2009
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,519
so

2010
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,600
next slide

2011
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,000
i promise i promise we will get the

2012
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,679
stapling part of it again i just think

2013
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,560
it's it's a lift

2014
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,560
um but i will say that

2015
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,480
if we're agreed about that

2016
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,560
i think this is probably pretty close

2017
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,840
actually

2018
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,239
like i i asked sean turner to take a

2019
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:27,840
look he sent me a mail earlier saying

2020
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,000
he'd taken a look at it he thought

2021
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,239
because we did this like five years ago

2022
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:34,880
or something is when we respect this out

2023
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,560
you still thought it was cool really

2024
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,920
russ i would love you to take a look at

2025
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,520
it as well and make sure you think it's

2026
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,520
cool i think you did the module or

2027
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,679
something at the end of it i do um

2028
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,360
you know but we could use more eyeballs

2029
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,320
you know make sure that this uh doesn't

2030
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,239
nothing has changed in the last like

2031
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,760
five years that we should have been

2032
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,120
thinking about

2033
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,000
um but not this this could be close to

2034
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,239
shipping actually that's my my general

2035
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,199
impression

2036
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,920
so i i would ask the chairs to identify

2037
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,199
some reviewers

2038
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,280
who can take a look at this and explain

2039
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,199
to me why my previous statement about

2040
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,520
that was incorrect

2041
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,080
all right so we'll we'll give this uh

2042
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,040
a little time to for people to look at

2043
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,080
post comments and then

2044
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,920
we're not hearing anything we'll do a

2045
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,719
working group last call

2046
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,760
okay all right thank you

2047
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,000
that's all i got

2048
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,920
this is all we got for today that's all

2049
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,520
we've got that's all we have on the

2050
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,239
agenda except aob

2051
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,320
is there any other business people would

2052
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,040
like to discuss today

2053
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,679
oh hi jack

2054
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,159
i just want to sneak in a question that

2055
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,600
i asked on the list and didn't get any

2056
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,040
response to

2057
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,880
which might be because no one knows the

2058
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,880
answer um

2059
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:55,760
in

2060
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,560
the

2061
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,159
certificate rfc

2062
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,040
the

2063
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,880
tn orth list

2064
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,840
is uh

2065
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,880
only non-critical which seems like a

2066
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,480
massive problem

2067
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,640
because anyone ignoring the tyr

2068
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,400
northlist um

2069
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,600
does not correctly understand

2070
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,000
um the scope of that certificate and i

2071
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,719
will almost certainly be wrong russ i'm

2072
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,000
looking at you man i know which

2073
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,640
extension

2074
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,239
oh yeah it's

2075
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,840
that's interesting

2076
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,520
and none of it's critical right none of

2077
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,320
those

2078
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,360
no stir specific extensions are critical

2079
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,520
because we felt at the time

2080
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,679
anybody who got one of these would

2081
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,400
totally be part of the system and

2082
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,679
understand the ones in the base rfc

2083
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:48,880
we didn't think but if that's true you

2084
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,239
might as well mark them as critical

2085
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:51,360
right

2086
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,120
i don't think it really matters for

2087
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,640
exactly that point but it just seemed

2088
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,440
very odd to me

2089
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,600
yeah i mean well that was the thinking

2090
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,520
yeah thus far we've imagined that these

2091
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,400
are very specialized you know cas right

2092
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,840
that are responsible for this that

2093
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,360
anybody's getting anything issued from

2094
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,360
them or indeed anybody who is seeing

2095
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,120
anything signed by them

2096
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,800
like you know has to be part of some

2097
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:22,159
closed or at least curated ecosystem

2098
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:33,559
are you asking to open the rfc

2099
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:36,560
oh okay just to be clear

2100
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,560
i will say that a focused update is an

2101
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,800
option but my second question is who

2102
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,800
wants it bad enough to write it yeah

2103
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,600
because if you want it you volunteer

2104
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,159
yeah that's that's not revised 8226.

2105
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:55,520
that's why it's just hearing

2106
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,679
it'll happen eventually

2107
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,800
this will all go away eventually

2108
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,960
but thank you jack

2109
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,159
any other other business

2110
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,320
there's like a lot more stuff we need to

2111
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,480
do we really need to get some energy

2112
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,400
behind connected identity it's something

2113
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,280
that

2114
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,199
um

2115
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,400
you know

2116
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,800
i i think you know chris actually gave

2117
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,280
connected identity a read uh this is the

2118
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,560
rfc 4916 update draft and i think he

2119
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,840
came away with a lot of the same kind of

2120
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,920
dispiriting sentiment which i have about

2121
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,560
it which is that we really need it

2122
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,880
but it's really clunky

2123
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,239
like and you know this is because

2124
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,800
original 4916 was clunky

2125
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,280
um because it's like hard to solve the

2126
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,239
problem

2127
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:47,679
of how you provide you know something

2128
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,880
cryptographic in sip responses

2129
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,080
that like

2130
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,639
can have any meaningful impact on sip

2131
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,880
transaction processing there are some

2132
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,120
very technical like stupid sip reasons

2133
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,199
why that's true but it basically means

2134
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:02,800
we're restricted to

2135
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,960
you know putting passports only into sip

2136
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,920
requests not just responses

2137
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,840
and like that means we need pracs and

2138
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,360
like all this other stuff and i just

2139
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,360
don't know if people are going to do it

2140
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,960
and like i don't

2141
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,880
you know so looking at it i'm wondering

2142
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,880
do we need to figure out something

2143
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,639
weirder

2144
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,560
right that is

2145
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,480
weirder than john elway was thinking

2146
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,199
when we did 4916 that we think people

2147
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,320
would actually implement

2148
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,880
yeah do we want to discuss

2149
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,600
so

2150
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,760
i think part of the reasoning there was

2151
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,080
also thinking about the whole messaging

2152
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,679
space as well

2153
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:43,360
which is a different interaction model

2154
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,880
than

2155
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,520
you know telephone calls

2156
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,679
and usually that relationship is

2157
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,440
established

2158
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,719
pre

2159
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,440
so like can we think more about that

2160
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,199
in terms there is a section in that

2161
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,520
document that talks about

2162
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,040
um

2163
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,000
i think

2164
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,320
non-media invites or something like that

2165
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,360
where

2166
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,120
you essentially establish a relationship

2167
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,880
we need to make sure that

2168
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,639
you can correlate

2169
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,159
that from

2170
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,320
the actual call itself and some other

2171
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,080
issues like that so i think there's some

2172
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,159
things to think about but

2173
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,679
i think that's the perspective i was

2174
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,280
thinking about like that we might

2175
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,360
actually want to use these in different

2176
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,080
contexts uh as a maybe separate

2177
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,199
mechanism

2178
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:28,639
yeah because i mean if you if you know

2179
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:30,880
sip and you look at this

2180
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,760
rfc 4916 update i mean it is full of

2181
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,920
like medialis dialogues that were then

2182
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,560
gonna update and upgrade into like media

2183
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,800
dialogues and because this is our best

2184
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,960
story for like how to actually make

2185
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,520
identity in the reverse direction

2186
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,000
and um

2187
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,199
i don't know how much appetite is there

2188
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,520
to go off the sip reservation on this

2189
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,480
because this will end up going to

2190
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,960
support whatever it is that we do

2191
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,320
like because it's really about you know

2192
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,560
all the same transaction mapping stuff

2193
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,120
that we got into post turf p

2194
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,800
and like you know

2195
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,320
all that stuff

2196
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,880
that like led us down this like crack

2197
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,480
path to get like

2198
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:19,920
um yeah well i mean effectively you are

2199
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,960
the question is do you want to do a

2200
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,040
before call setup

2201
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,639
right that's the problem you want to do

2202
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,960
this in an early media phase

2203
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,880
because you know you you want this

2204
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,600
ideally to be pre-alerting

2205
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,120
and that's how you end up with menialist

2206
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,480
dialogues and you have to make

2207
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,159
assumptions about your ways pressing

2208
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,880
things and like it's really really

2209
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,280
clunky

2210
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,880
i blame john elway who is not here

2211
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,040
and for that reason i'm going to blame

2212
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,080
him

2213
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,719
entirely

2214
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,159
well i mean it's not like we actually

2215
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:57,840
have to solve for a fetus office it's

2216
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,840
just like

2217
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,920
you know it's really just the simple

2218
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,480
fact the problem is if you get back you

2219
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,840
get back a sith response that tells you

2220
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,440
like this is the identity of the other

2221
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,679
side and the response is broken in some

2222
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:12,639
way

2223
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:15,040
there's no way to reject a response

2224
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,760
right that's the fundamental problem

2225
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,960
like if you get back 200 okay or 183

2226
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,920
with early media okay you know

2227
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,159
and like what what is actually in it is

2228
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:28,560
a passport and that passport

2229
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,080
does not support you don't support a

2230
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,840
trust anchor or there's something like

2231
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,960
wrong with the number that's being

2232
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,000
asserted and like that then

2233
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,719
and of course you need the

2234
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,320
identity track of getting the from

2235
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,800
header field to correspond to who you

2236
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,639
actually reached instead of the original

2237
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,639
transaction mapping identifiers

2238
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,560
that's how you end up with like prac

2239
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,719
and it sucks i mean it's just like this

2240
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,719
is like such a horrible awkward way to

2241
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,560
do this

2242
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,320
and like we need to go back to like a

2243
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,920
sip level drawing board to fix it

2244
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,120
but i don't know where to fix it

2245
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,360
so i think we're effectively into what

2246
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,960
would normally count as offline

2247
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,520
discussion it's true so we can just

2248
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,600
clear this aoe let's just turn this into

2249
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,199
offline discussion thank you so much for

2250
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,120
coming and anytime you mention her fp

2251
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,719
then beer is required yes

2252
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,920
okay then thank you very much and enjoy

2253
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,960
the rest of the idea

2254
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,599
thank you

2255
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,600
yes

2256
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,080
is

2257
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,840
so robert said that mary was poking

2258
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,159
around and changed it to 80 and watching

2259
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:14,320
it that somehow committed the wrong

2260
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,679
email

2261
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:18,000
unless
