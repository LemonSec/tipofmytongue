the notes that I did for him uh

14
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,720
yesterday in which were maybe the worst

15
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,780
I think I've ever done

16
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,660

21
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,640

23
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,200

31
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,560

again you'll be the notetaker

33
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,700
as the as he quickly mutes

34
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,900
um

35
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,220

41
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,078
foreign

42
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,060
I'm gonna start randomly clicking on

43
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,320
people in the participants list and

44
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,940
telling them asking if they can take

45
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,080
notes

46
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080

people want to also join the the Cody MD

50
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,860

you think he's captured everything that

53
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,320
would also be great

54
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,139
at which point I think since it is now

55
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,940

56
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,919

polls all of which are good things

73
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,539
um

74
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,580
if you're here in person

75
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,960
and you choose to join the full version

76
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,300
keep your audio and video off because

77
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,759
you can already see us the old-fashioned

78
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,440
way and

79
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,160
um

80
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,539
please

81
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,220
everybody's doing that go well now but

82
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,560
please keep if you're here in the room

83
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,319
um please keep your masks on

84
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,000
unless you're actively speaking at the

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,039
front of the room

86
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,660
um if you're remote

87
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,979
keep your

88
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,960
um don't send audio or video unless you

89
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
are presenting during a session or

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,860
asking a question

91
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,620
and um using the headset is strongly

92
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,840
recommended because sometimes the echo

93
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
cancellation doesn't work right

94
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,120
next

95
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,380
um remote meeting tips

96
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,600
you enter the queue with the

97
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,840
no hand leave with hand because who

98
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,340
knows why

99
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,380
um you'll need to enable your audio when

100
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,660
it's your turn to talk

101
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,759
um similarly

102
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,039
the unveiling icons

103
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,940
um

104
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,560
you can also enable video if you want

105
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,060
but that's separate from audio if you

106
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,380
just enable your video we will see you

107
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,940
without hear you which

108
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,240
for most purposes is not terribly useful

109
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,639
um videos encouraged

110
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,060
um but not not required

111
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,539
next

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,639
uh here are some links

113
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
you can't click on them in here but you

114
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,120
can go to the

115
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,860
if you go to the data tracker you can

116
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,380
find various information you can you can

117
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,940
find the the slides and they should be

118
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,620
clickable in there I think

119
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,660
next

120
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,039
no well

121
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,539
um hopefully everybody has seen this by

122
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,479
now since it's Thursday but if not

123
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,240
um you are agreeing to

124
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,400
uh but first of any ietf you're agreeing

125
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,000
to follow the IDF procedures notably

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,099
um you'll have to

127
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,520
declare if you have IPR

128
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,080
that's an open simplification please

129
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,300
read the things

130
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,699

and you agree to follow the code of

135
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,419
conduct

136
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,780

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,959
of us within the ITF Community these

176
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,760
remarks are a slightly longer version of

177
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,200
the tribute prepared for the plenary

178
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,000
yesterday and they include a few

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,279
additional photos and links to a few

180
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,040
online readings writings and viewings

181
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,899
for those of you who may not have had

182
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,760
the pleasure of knowing Steve directly

183
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,740
his vision and Leadership were

184
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,080
instrumental to the success of ietf

185
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,180
multimedia standards and protocols that

186
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,399
have driven the success of ip-based

187
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,740
telephony and multimedia conferencing as

188
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,360
well as other real-time multicast and

189
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,940
unicast applications he began that

190
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,040
Journey at Occidental College he

191
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,019
graduated in 1973 with a degree in

192
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,519
mathematics and then he obtained a

193
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,140
master's in computer science from the

194
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,880
University of Southern California in

195
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,440
1976.

196
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,160
beginning in 1974 he joined USC's

197
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,380
information Sciences Institute as a

198
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,940
graduate student and remained there for

199
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,360
22 years he contributed to the software

200
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,860
design and implementation of some of the

201
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,420
earliest experiments with packet voice

202
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,760
on the arpanet and thus he contributed

203
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,920
to the publication of the network voice

204
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,540
protocol RFC 741 published in 1977 a

205
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,839
year before the TCP IP split and a year

206
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:37,680
before

207
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,660
UDP was defined

208
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,060
as high bandwidth packet satellite and

209
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,800
terrestrial networks became operational

210
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,440
in the 1980s he led the multimedia

211
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,899
conferencing project at isi to develop

212
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,519
and deploy packet video over those

213
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,940
Networks he built a custom

214
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,200
packet-oriented video Codec and later

215
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,640
developed techniques that allowed

216
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,500
commercial video codecs designed for

217
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,300
circuits to operate over packet switch

218
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,200
networks it was at isi in 1988 hate to

219
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,500
confess that that I first met Steve I

220
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,140
date myself and but I had the privilege

221
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,360
to work closely with him over six and a

222
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,220
half years it is also where I was

223
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,380
indoctrinated through him into the iitf

224
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,640
community culture and working group

225
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,839
process

226
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,660
that same year in 1988 Steve is

227
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,220
documented in the proceedings of the

228
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,000
ietf 11 as having participated in his

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,720
first ITF meeting in Annapolis Maryland

230
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,180
and as many of you may recall his lovely

231
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,339
wife of over 40 years Karen Kastner

232
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,980
often attended ietf meetings with him

233
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,380
at that time Steve attended to

234
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,180
contribute to the working group focused

235
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,920
on the experimental internet stream

236
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,899
protocol version 2 that provided the

237
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,180
technical underpinnings of the earliest

238
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,579
isi BBN Pack video teleconferencing

239
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,060
system St as it was known however was

240
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,100
connection oriented not datagram like I

241
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,800
like IP it included a small header using

242
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,660
per hop identifiers and supported

243
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,660
point-to-point or multi to point to

244
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,000
multi-point connections as well as

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,860
providing Network bandwidth reservation

246
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,399
what would later become RFC 1190

247
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,680
Steve would go on to found the audio

248
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,100
video transfer working group avt fastest

249
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,440
facets of which live on today in ABT

250
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,320
core he served of its chair he served

251
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,300
later as co-chair from 1991 until 2003.

252
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,540
he authored 15 rfcs and most notably was

253
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,700
an author and the principal editor of

254
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,100
the real-time transport protocol RTP

255
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,500
certification which has had a huge

256
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,139
impact as you all know a multimedia data

257
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,180
transmission in on and across the

258
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,200
internet

259
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,540
Steve regularly acknowledged that RTP is

260
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,160
designed Drew significantly from the

261
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,019
earlier Network voice protocol and its

262
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,279
sister protocol the packet video

263
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,260
protocol the designs of which were

264
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,120
spearheaded by the late Danny Cohen who

265
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,639
ran the networking division at isi

266
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,100
beginning in 1992 Steve was the primary

267
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,440
organizer of the movement to establish

268
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,720
the worldwide internet multicast

269
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,360
backbone affectionately referred to as

270
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,399
the m-bone an experimental virtual

271
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,019
Network overlaying the internet for

272
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,880
broadcast of audio and video using

273
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,519
multicast IP and rtp-based applications

274
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,459
it was launched in case you didn't know

275
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,440
this at the request of Allison mankin

276
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
who was pregnant at the time and unable

277
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,700
to travel to the upcoming ITF meetings

278
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,820
the m-bone enabled live streaming of ITF

279
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,579
meetings including return audio from

280
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,860
remote participants and in many ways the

281
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,779
Unbound tools were the precursor to our

282
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,459
hybrid meet Echo meetings and the

283
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,560
precursor to the multitude of video

284
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,260
conferencing apps in our lives today

285
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,380
the m-bone was carried the M bone also

286
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,240
carried the first internet radio

287
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,180
broadcasts it provided audio chat rooms

288
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,060
for Network Geeks streamed NASA TV of

289
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,940
the first Hubble repair broadcasted a

290
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,040
Rolling Stones concert resulting in a

291
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,740
Newsweek article boldly displaying Steve

292
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,720
castner Van Jacobson and Steve Dearing

293
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,820
as our modern day superheroes and

294
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,380
demonstrated the first distributed music

295
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,540
performance with distributed performers

296
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,079
at the ACM multimedia 94 conference in

297
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,540
1995 Steve took his expertise into the

298
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,220
commercial Arena to further develop

299
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,899
conferencing and streaming apps at

300
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,820
precept software later acquired by Cisco

301
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,500
Systems in 1998 where he was a

302
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,000
distinguished engineer

303
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,060
from 2000 until retiring in 2014 he

304
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,800
shifted gears to work on network

305
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,420
performance measurement and routing

306
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,540
analysis as a fellow at packet design

307
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,399
in retirement he continued to work on

308
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
various projects such as volunteering

309
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,360
for the Computer History Museum to

310
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,399
produce an operational emulation of the

311
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,959
1960s era IBM 1620 computer a room-sized

312
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,120
computer where he first got his start in

313
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,279
coding as an undergrad at Occidental

314
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,740
College as a brilliant engineer Steve

315
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,540
also enjoyed sharing his creations with

316
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,699
others one of the more unique ones being

317
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,100
his solid-state digital Monopoly game

318
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,959
that he first showcased at the PC

319
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,959
Festival in Anaheim in 1978 which he

320
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,339
continued to Tinker with and improve

321
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,500
over the decades but deliberately tried

322
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,060
to preserve the usage of the technology

323
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,480
from the era when it was first created

324
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,160
at the same time he was pushing the

325
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,899
envelope of Internet architecture Steve

326
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,120
also was an early early adopter of

327
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,279
electric vehicle technology and fit his

328
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,560
house with solar panels decades ago

329
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,480
not surprisingly he enjoyed helping

330
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,360
debug the early Tesla Roadster EV before

331
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,279
it was released to the public and yes

332
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,779
that's a picture of some of the earliest

333
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,060
Roadster owners on a group road trip

334
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,699
down the coast of California photo taken

335
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,560
out of the back of Steve's red Roadster

336
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,899
hopefully by the passenger and not the

337
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,100
driver

338
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
for those of you who have the privilege

339
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,259
to work with Steve you know firsthand

340
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,540
that he had an encyclopedic knowledge

341
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,339
about anything and everything with which

342
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,800
he became involved and he enjoyed being

343
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,899
a keeper of the prehistory of the

344
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,399
internet's Evolution tour packet audio

345
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,360
and video his attention to detail was

346
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,800
unrivaled by anybody I have ever met

347
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
whether it wasn't bringing the real-time

348
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,579
transport protocol to life or in

349
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,920
rebuilding historical Electronics

350
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,199
his meticulousness motivated those of us

351
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,060
lucky enough to collaborate with him to

352
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,560
bring our best selves to the task at

353
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,259
hand and in addition to his wisdom Steve

354
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:15,240
was the consummate role model for quiet

355
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,779
leadership humility and kindness in 2011

356
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,720
he was awarded the 2011 leadership award

357
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,639
by the international multimedia

358
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,220
teleconferencing Consortium

359
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,980
and in 2020 he was the co-recipient of

360
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,380
the IEEE internet award having been

361
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,600
nominated by his ABT co-chair Colin

362
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,639
Perkins whose wise words I paraphrase

363
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,660
here

364
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,360
Steve has long provided an example of

365
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,160
how an ITF working group chair should

366
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,860
act with humility and fairness while

367
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,480
building on a deep understanding of the

368
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,980
underlying technology and systems

369
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,440
architecture he saw consensus where none

370
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,660
seemed possible he would patiently

371
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,519
patiently listen to all sides of an

372
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,040
argument identify the concerns correct

373
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,600
misunderstandings of the architecture

374
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,060
and then quietly carefully and

375
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,160
respectfully help the working group come

376
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,559
to consensus it is without doubt that

377
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,880
Steve's Technical and Leadership

378
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,859
contributions were essential to the

379
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,260
success of RTP in particular and

380
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,179
internet multimedia standards and

381
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,760
protocols in general

382
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,740
Steve passed away on the morning of July

383
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,160
4th 2022 an auspicious state in the U.S

384
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,339
celebrated his independence day

385
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,160
when the fireworks began in the evening

386
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,959
this July 4th I couldn't help but

387
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,880
imagine the fireworks were celebrating

388
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,919
Steve's life all that he accomplished

389
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,080
and all the people whose lives he

390
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,460
touched

391
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,220
in conclusion and to Echo the sentiments

392
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,960

393

394
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,360
Steve's passing it was truly a gift to

395
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,640

396

held in August or to donate to the

401
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,640
endowed chair in computer science that

402
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,799
he and Karen seated with the honorarium

403
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,960
from the IEEE internet award and it was

404
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,240
established for the newly created CS

405
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,340

I assembled a few pointers to readings

409
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,679
and writings and viewings for those of

410
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,600
you who might like to reminisce a little

411
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,740
bit further

412
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,500

00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,600
a few words about Steve

417
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,340
okay thank you well Magnus is coming up

418
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,120
for Magnus okay

419

[Music]

420
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,480
is that on

421
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,780
yeah

422
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,980
okay yeah

423
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,820
I mean I replaced or tried to replace

424
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,340
yeah Steve casters co-chair or EBT back

425
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,940
in 2003 very large shows to try to step

426
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,400
faster

427
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,440
and and

428
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,299
provided very I think very good role

429
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,720
model for how to be a chair and go on

430
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,480
and I think it's been very important for

431
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,940
my development in ITF so

432
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,740
I will

433
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,240
keep on remembering

434
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,720
column

435
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,660
yeah I have a good filter ad that hasn't

436
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,810
been said already

437
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,000
[Music]

438
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,860
there are some very big shoes to fill

439
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,020
Steve was

440
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,520
um

441
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,700
I think the role model for how a chair

442
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,500
should behave

443
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,240
always

444
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,400
um as Eve said always

445
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,179
um

446
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,100
incredibly well prepared incredibly

447
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,400
knowledgeable incredibly polite

448
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,559
incredibly tactful and willing to work

449
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,100
to to gauge consensus

450
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,740
it it says it was very much a privilege

451
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,900
to work with him

452
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,640
who

453
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,400
I

454
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,940
um lift up to those shoes when I joined

455
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,059
this coach here and I hope that it would

456
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,679
be uh

457
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,740
a a an example for many in the idea I

458
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,380
think of the way he shared groups

459
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,340
he'll be missed

460
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,700
all right thank you everybody

461
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,240
thank you so much

462
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,700
all right now on to our regular agenda

463
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,200
which I'm sure he would want us to

464
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,059
continue to work on

465
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,220
uh so we're going to start with kryptex

466
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,600
of Sergio

467
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,480
and the DVC palette format skip payload

468
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,820
format

469
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,460
7983 this which is the demultiplexing

470
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,679
and then two things in rtpo for quick

471
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,440
both the both the RTP proper and the sdp

472
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,880
uh and then v3c and green metadata

473

00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,520
so other people have slides

512
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,100
you know we're on if you want to get it

513
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,720
things aren't working right you can see

514
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,500
them

515
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,500
great

516
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,539
um

517
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,600
yeah so um yes and then

518
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,840
and we did um we need a revised ID on

519
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,580
frameworking

520
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,020
um so mother's nodding in the back of

521
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,460
the room so hopefully that means that

522
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,260
will happen soon

523
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,640
um

524
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,760
yes and then

525
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,200
uh working group bus call completed

526
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,760
um

527
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,299
on uh Skip and secondary best we'll have

528
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,159
discussions of those

529
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,620
and we have adopted

530
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,539
RDP over quick

531
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,220
and we did a call for adoption GameStop

532
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,320
for RTP which we'll talk about next

533
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,940
slide I think it is

534
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,559
yes so on game State over RTP

535
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,020
um there were only two responses one of

536
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,460
whom was the

537
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,960
same organization as the initial

538
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,340
proposer

539
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,080
so

540
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,740
um

541
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,000
our suggestion is that

542
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,100
the

543
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,440
proponents uh go to the community I get

544
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,120
the impression that the interested

545
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,279
Community here is not the usual

546
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,919
uh suspects we get here in the ABT Core

547
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,620
Group so um

548
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,360
we're asking

549
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,179
and I've asked colonists also personally

550
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:28,620
asking them to send to go and um

551
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,059
try to get some people to express

552
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:34,080
interest in the document

553
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,880
um and we will

554
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,419
extend our call for adoption

555
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,279
until sometime in September so that

556
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,960
people can do it after August Vacations

557
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,000
so if

558
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,880
I guess one question is do we know who

559
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,279
the who the core constituency is so we

560
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,659
can actually reach them which we

561
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,279
presumably we didn't do the last time

562
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,200
yeah I mean I think what we should do is

563
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,580
we should

564
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,640
um ask I mean uh Colin Jennings as the

565
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,000
person who proposed this to

566
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,779
um

567
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,580
deducted I mean I think he knows who the

568
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,100
community is so he we should ask him to

569
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,860
to ask them to come and indicate their

570
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,459
interest in this

571
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,320
if they are still interested

572
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,340
all right next cryptex Association

573
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,940
hi hello so this is life please

574
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,140
so the current status of the draft is

575
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,020
that since we submittedly for ISD review

576
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,179
we have receiving 39 comments

577
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,980
directorate review

578
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,419
so they

579
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,640
all the non-contentious feedback has

580
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,640
been incorporated into the graph and

581
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,740
there are three feedback that I

582
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,600
considered it as one fix that I was

583
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,620
playing later

584
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,360
and V8 open a STL open issues that it is

585
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,980
what I am going to explain during this

586
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,080
meeting so we try to to get Twitter from

587
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,480
then and try to to see

588
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,200
um

589
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,799
how to address them some of them is is

590
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,080
just called to action so it's and

591
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,120
deciding if we agree on on the feedback

592
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,399
and if we incorporate it or not so I

593
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,919
think that most of the will be

594
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,200
easy to explain but not really easy to

595
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,059
get a consensus so that's a slide please

596
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,279
so the the one fixed issues is the first

597
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,440
one is was the user's inclusive language

598
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,980
and this was mainly because of the of

599
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,720
the term master key

600
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,700
that's either that I don't think that I

601
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,260
can change it in the in the draft

602
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,179
because it is referencing the master key

603
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,260
term in the RPC 3711 so I think that if

604
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,659
we need to we have to change

605
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,419
or for changing the draft decrypted that

606
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,360
we'll have to also update the RCC 3711

607
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,659
to to update and remove the the master

608
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,179
key term and replace it for something

609
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,299
else

610
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:15,539
and then the next one was in a request

611
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,279
to see if we can provide more details

612
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,440
about the fingerprint issues about the

613
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,919
and the the RTP the uses of the RTP

614
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,500
header extension a part of what it is

615
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,500
already shown in the OR describing the

616
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,659
header extension

617
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,059
um the RPC I don't think that there is

618
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,580
anything else that I can reference

619
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,440
so that's what I have considered this

620
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,340
this as not fixed if anyone has say any

621
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,620
any draft or any publication that we can

622
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,600
link it will be right but if not I I

623
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,460
think that we cannot do much more on

624
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,080
this

625
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,440
and the the last one was about checking

626
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,380
if we should register the two new values

627
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,320
for the definite by profile it has the

628
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,299
value that was incorporated in the draft

629
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,600
but um there is no INR register already

630
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,600
for this values so I don't think that it

631
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,159
is something that this technique is to

632
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,220
solve if we the it should be done in

633
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,380
either RCC

634
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,179
um 82 85 or or even in the RPC

635
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:21,720
35 15. so

636
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,760
um I don't because I again I don't think

637
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,980
that Crystal shouldn't there's other

638
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,740
Ayana register if the other drafts that

639
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,460
Define these values and and Define the

640
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,080
register we could add the values that we

641
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,520
have definite in the in the graph

642
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,200
so any feedback about these issues

643
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,039
Murray

644
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,260
yeah

645
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,640
all right this is Murray about the

646
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,159
Ayanna question so does that mean we're

647
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,840
okay with those values just being

648
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,059
registered in a scattering of rfcs and

649
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,440
that's we're okay with that I'm just

650
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,000
making it yeah I think for for yeah I

651
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,299
mean these are I think the

652
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,880
second and third ever defined for I mean

653
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,320
sorry maybe third and fourth ever decide

654
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,960
to find where this value and I think I'm

655
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,360
I mean I think

656
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,279
at some point it might be useful to do a

657
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,600
registry if we ever get any more of

658
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,980
these but I wouldn't recommend blocking

659
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,480
this draft on that I'm okay with

660
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,220
interesting I guess the other option is

661
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,360
like do you want to make a separate

662
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,039
document just all it does is create the

663
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,539
registry and collect values and you

664
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,220
could do that too yeah I'm fine I just

665
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,380
wanted to see like I think you know if I

666
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,700
think that might be worth doing if we

667
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,100
ever get a another one but for now I

668
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,059
think it's probably not necessary

669
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
um

670
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,120
so message like this

671
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,919
so there was another the and one issue

672
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,559
raised by by Ayana that there was a

673
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,659
mismatch between then the

674
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,580
the description of the parameter and

675
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,640
what was actually being registered so we

676
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,260
said that they could be used at that

677
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,240
session level of media labor but the

678
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,279
general registration only registered it

679
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,760
for media level uh I think this was a

680
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,799
mistake that I made when one of the

681
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,279
drafts so I removed it intentionally the

682
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,580
decision level one and what I have done

683
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,559
in the in the new draft is to just put

684
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,419
the back again that it can be used for

685
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,360
session level and media level but as I

686
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,059
mean as it was it's a change to them to

687
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,700
the to the to the graph I wanted to

688
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,279
write it here to just to see if this is

689
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,960
this is still the consensus of the group

690
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,720
or if anyone has any any concerned about

691
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,240
how it is at both session level media

692
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,360
level

693
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,260
so nested light please

694
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,059
also there was two questions about iprs

695
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:01,679
and I don't think that we need to to

696
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,220
do anything Bernard already already

697
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,260
answered those issues in in both the

698
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,960
mailing lists and in the issues and I'm

699
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,460
not sure if we need to do anything else

700
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,039
regarding this to to fix the to or to

701
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,399
cover the the feedback or if we need to

702
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,880
do anything else regarding this

703
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,440
well we we covered it in the last

704
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,179
meeting and also on the mailing list so

705
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,519
I think the only issue was that at the

706
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,200
time I did the write-up we didn't have

707
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,519
the disclosure so that's why the

708
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,919
confusion was created

709
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,440
okay thank you but not

710
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,580
so next one please

711
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,380
so this one is the there was one uh that

712
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,480
and that recommended that this would be

713
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,620
formally update the RPC 3711 because it

714
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,539
also they this is a mechanism or it's a

715
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:58,879
alternative approach of foreign

716
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,419
to check that if everyone is okay if

717
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,279
with this change

718
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,799
and the second thing is that when I have

719
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,700
included this in the in the in the in

720
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,460
the draft I have two warnings when when

721
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,799
updated to the when when submitting the

722
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,760
draft

723
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,700
and I'm not sure if the first one should

724
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,679
be ignore or not

725
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,360
or if anyone can get me some some

726
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,500
guidance regarding that

727
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,960
yeah the first one can be ignored the

728
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,419
second one Simon should probably be

729
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,100
yeah

730
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,460
did you ever come up

731
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,679
it doesn't mean that this is just with

732
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,779
respect to this IPR slide there were

733
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,700
some languages offense me a little bit

734
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,440
and I would put to put on the record

735
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,740
that I don't believe the IDF has

736
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,539
something like

737
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:04,080
um

738
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,659
requirement for an IPR disclosure to be

739
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:09,300
compatible with something the ipf has

740
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,520
yeah there are certain formal

741
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,399
requirements how to make a disclosure

742
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,379
but and when to make a disclosure but

743
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:18,379
what is in there

744
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:22,800
uh is none of our business here yeah

745
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,418
certainly there's no such thing as

746
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,599
incompatible with the ITF IPR disclosure

747
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,399
thank you bye

748
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,719
so yeah I think on this slide I think

749
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,980
yeah the

750
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,440
your two resolutions are correct ignore

751
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,359
the disclaimer that's just making sure

752
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,579
you didn't import any text from 3711

753
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:45,719
which you didn't

754
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,119
yep

755
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,300
okay so necess like please this one is a

756
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,300
bit more

757
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,520
there was some some feedback about if a

758
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,520
we should first deprecate RPC uh since

759
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,839
904

760
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,720
and then you say if we should and if

761
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,940
both are negotiated if we sweep the

762
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,280
Mandate or we should recommend that the

763
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,680
agree test should be used instead of a

764
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,980
RPC since 904 because currently the it

765
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,400
is up to the implementation so

766
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,720
yeah

767
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,839
um in this one Sergio I I don't know if

768
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:27,480
it makes sense because when you offer

769
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,420
both cryptex and 6904 it means I can

770
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,640
receive either one

771
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,260
right which you might do because you

772
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,000
don't know what the other side will

773
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,700
actually support right presumably the

774
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,440
other the answer should only pick one of

775
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,560
them

776
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,240
yeah so I think you know this is this

777
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,220
question is a bit confused

778
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,040
yeah I think that it is about if it is a

779
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,440
one receiver support both if the sender

780
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,119
if we should say that the sender should

781
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,960
use grid test instead of instead of RPC

782
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,880
cs904 well it's up to the sender right

783
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,579
the sender can pick one the sender

784
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,200
remember the center the other side the

785
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,700
answer is also saying what it can

786
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,500
receive

787
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,260
yeah right it's it's not it's not

788
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,780
choosing from among the things that the

789
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,640
that they're in the offer it's saying

790
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,800
what I can receive so it might also say

791
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,140
I can receive both

792
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,180
it's up to the sender then to decide

793
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,859
what to send

794
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,540
but we want to give me guidance on

795
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,740
towards that

796
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,480
yeah you could give guidance on that

797
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,480
it's not yeah on what you should send if

798
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,839
if you have the option of both yeah

799
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,920
Magnus did you ever

800
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,640
uh my name is

801
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,220
I think it would be wrong to deprecate

802
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,500
the normal way of

803
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,760
doing the header extensions

804
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,500
I know there are other usages out there

805
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,720
or at least proposed usages well it's

806
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,579
not compatible with cryptex

807
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,859
so obviously there are things where you

808
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,260
do need the in the clear headers yeah

809
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,700
yeah and I guess it wouldn't be to

810
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,960
deprecate

811
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,400
the header extensions you know

812
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,660
unencrypted header extensions at all

813
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,680
it's do you want to do you want to

814
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,079
deprecate the of the old counter

815
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,760
extension encryption mechanism

816
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,060
yeah but no so

817
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,119
I know that 3dp has some proposals where

818
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,460
it will put they want to have header

819
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,320
extensions declare I think they might

820
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,760
also be head extensions that needs to be

821
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,440
encrypted so therefore the old mechanism

822
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,480
is going to be needed

823
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,800
um which is so

824
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,000
so therefore and I think it's it's just

825
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,339
uh if I understood but not correct here

826
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,380
it's like yeah let the application

827
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,200
declare and select what expressed their

828
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,420
preference according to normal STP rules

829
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,640
Etc or other singular mechanisms

830
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,040
so yeah I mean my inclination would be

831
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,099
to say if you support both

832
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,680
you know you should do cryptex unless

833
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,780
you have a need to send both

834
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,160
unless you actually have an application

835
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,720
need to send both encrypted and in the

836
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,760
clear headers in the same packets

837
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,440
would that be reasonable

838
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,400
if you support both

839
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,839
I I mean if if you intend to encrypt

840
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,640
everything yeah I guess it should would

841
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,020
be fine yeah yeah

842
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,119
so um

843
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,980
yeah I mean I'd suggest

844
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,960
um if you followed that Sergio

845
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,320
I'd say suggest you know do a PR and

846
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,200
post to the list and ask

847
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,280
are you getting back in the queue or are

848
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,700
you just

849
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,619
or did I should remove your heart

850
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:35,820
all right

851
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,940
um

852
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,859
yes so we said no that we should not

853
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:44,160
deprecate the RCC 6904 and we put up

854
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,700
yard for with the suit if the sender

855
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,579
support both that this should uh it's to

856
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,839
send group text is that if even if it if

857
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:59,720
it doesn't require to to specifically

858
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,280
nothing with it

859
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,020
that'll be my inclination but you know

860
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,960
if anybody else has any comments well I

861
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,760
I agree that you should not deprecate

862
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,140
6904

863
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,119
um that that would make sense

864
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,579
um but if you're negotiating cryptex and

865
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:17,760
you do see and you also support 1604

866
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,740
um I think the whole point of supporting

867
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,560
critics is you want more security and

868
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,680
you want you know less revealed

869
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,960
um so I don't understand why you would

870
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,720
say should and not must here if you say

871
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,900
should what is the exception of when you

872
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,960
when you may not again I think if you

873
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,520
actually have an application need to

874
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,200
have some header extensions in the clear

875
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,240
and some encrypted but but why would you

876
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,319
negotiate cryptex then yeah

877
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,440
no yeah you're not actually negotiating

878
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,660
it Mo you're just saying I I am capable

879
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,460
of receiving it

880
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,380
right that's a separate Choice from what

881
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,740
you send

882
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,859
so you think that there's a security

883
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,319
requirement asymmetrically that uh that

884
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,380
I I'm very security conscious about what

885
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,520
I've received but I'm not very security

886
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,560
conscious about what I send

887
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,540
stranger things have happened no no I

888
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,339
mean it's I'm just saying that decisions

889
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:15,720
are separate I think what we're talking

890
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,420
about here is what you send if the other

891
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,760
side says it can receive both

892
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,220
well I I thought that the resolution was

893
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,260
going to be to say if you support both

894
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,359
then you should use cryptics and usually

895
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,099
when you put a should you should you

896
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:31,980
specify when you would not what's the

897
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,660
exception why is it not a must when

898
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,119
would you not do this and I'm having a

899
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,520
hard time envisioning what useful text

900
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,319
you would say of when you would not do

901
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,960
this yeah I I suggest we

902
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,160
um discuss some of the last ones we have

903
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,740
text once we have a PR unit okay yeah

904
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,260
because okay

905
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,400
okay I think this is light please yeah

906
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,940
so this one is a and currently we said

907
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,400
that if we say that the

908
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,060
that we support created a wheel or an

909
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,339
and the application considering that it

910
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,560
is mandatory but we receive an RDP that

911
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,380
has not acquisite headers that we should

912
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,200
process in the RTP packet

913
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,720
and then the question was is not a

914
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,259
massive stop

915
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,859
so

916
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:22,319
I mean I would agree given that there's

917
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,060
there's the if you consider it mandatory

918
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,040
which is obviously yeah another

919
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,020
vegetation decision I think cost is fine

920
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,220
for that conditional case

921
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,940
that's sort of the definition of

922
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,720
mandatory yeah yeah yeah yeah so I agree

923
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,300
so either we we should change the the

924
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,040
mandatory or we should put a master

925
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,079
okay lesson light

926
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,099
so this is what is the The Next Step so

927
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:54,480
I will

928
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,240
I will just make the the pr that it is

929
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,280
missing and publish it to the end to the

930
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,260
mailing list for confirmation and when

931
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,000
that is done is

932
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,640
I will produce a new grid text graph and

933
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,220
I'm not sure what do we need to do next

934
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,339
if we should have a last call again or

935
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:15,300
again ISD review I think well I'm trying

936
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,119
what exactly is the procedure

937
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,579
uh you know um if I think I think it

938
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,980
just goes to the iesg and the ISC

939
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,020
members decide whether it um

940
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,839
satisfies their uh discuss and comments

941
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,839
so I think that's all right I don't

942
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,280
think these changes are big enough to

943
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,440
require another working group last call

944
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,980
hmm

945
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,740
yeah I agree okay

946
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,420
okay so then all right all from a second

947
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,720
thank you but hold on Magnus

948
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,200
I yeah um so on this one I think we said

949
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,660
I think we said we've got a must in you

950
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,800
know

951
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,420
I think that

952
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,040
Sergio said either go to muster change

953
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,540
the word mandatory I'd be inclined to

954
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,619
say go to must because I think that's

955
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:08,819
the easiest

956
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,280
you know easiest thing to

957
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,720
you know say

958
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,640
but anybody else have any comments

959
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,560
all right

960
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,040
okay I think that's it okay thank you

961
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,280
Sergio yeah thank you thank you

962
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,520
Stefan's up next

963
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,880
I'm here uh BBC payload for my next

964
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,560
slide

965
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,819
thank you so uh version 16 was out uh in

966
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,760
the isg they came up with album with

967
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,560
three discusses and a whole bunch of

968
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,160
useful comments including a real

969
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,280
stupid Buck from our side we populated

970
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,819
the the Yana template only halfway and

971
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:59,760
copy paste error stupid stuff anyway

972
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,800
um

973
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,920
these three discusses two were cleared

974
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,520
after we published words in 17

975
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,359
uh in 17 we tried to address everything

976
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,079
so let's discuss remained and that is

977
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:18,839
related to a technology that was

978
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:22,680
introduced in RCA 3984 back 20 years ago

979
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,920
or so regarding sender properties which

980
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,660
is something that somewhat changes the

981
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,520
um in in and offer answers scenario

982
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,980
someone changes the semantics of of how

983
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,220
you use STP basically um now

984
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,020
um

985
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:44,400
that that history was probably not uh

986
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,520
um in inside's mind when he uh came up

987
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,140
with this discuss so we had a meeting

988
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,760
this morning

989
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,520
um and uh the the outcome of that

990
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,079
meeting is that well I have informative

991
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,000
language explaining this unusual

992
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,599
behavior of s-prop per points

993
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,300
um and issue a version 18 and he plans

994
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,099
to clear his discuss against that

995
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,160
version 18 if things are looking good

996
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,359
and then

997
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,000
um our suggestion or author suggestion

998
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,740
is

999
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,800
um the updated yarner template which was

1000
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,660
the only significant normative change

1001
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,760
actually the only normative change if I

1002
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,200
recall uh that was signed up by by the

1003
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,980
Jana review uh signed off and the era

1004
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,900
directors

1005
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,400
generally responded thanks for

1006
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,720
addressing our comments so I think uh we

1007
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,420
and this change here will be in an

1008
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,640
purely informative so I think we don't

1009
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,020
need another last program in the working

1010
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:43,740
group

1011
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,900
what the IDF is doing is up to the what

1012
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,640
the isg is doing is up to the isg

1013
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,940
obviously thank you very much

1014
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,380
for a second sure I think that should be

1015
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,619
fine yeah

1016
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,259
all right

1017
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,480
any comments on any of that or show me

1018
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,800
one

1019
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,680
all right next is Skip I think Dan are

1020
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,359
you presenting

1021
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:10,380
or is it Mike oh Mike Let's uh I'll

1022
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,599
start the show off a little bit okay um

1023
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,640
this is Mike Fowler and good afternoon

1024
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,599
to the ABT Corp Community uh next next

1025
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,880
slide please

1026
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,760
uh our status this is awaiting external

1027
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,700
review resolution of issues raised

1028
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,060
um we uh an email is referenced here

1029
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,160
from the music working group that

1030
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,900
indicates third review the sdp is

1031
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,420
complete and I guess the important

1032
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,579
message is it does not define any new

1033
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,220
sdp attributes there is no need for any

1034
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,579
new sdp procedures

1035
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:47,460
gen Arts review had a simple summary of

1036
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,380
the simple document is adequate to

1037
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,660
register the media type as is

1038
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,940
art art had some questions on it and

1039
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,280
basically said not ready and we'll go

1040
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,859
over the the comments uh from the

1041
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:02,160
community in the next slides our draft

1042
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,560
is due to expire on November 26th and

1043
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,980
Dan will pick up this we uh we put this

1044
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,180
together

1045
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,220
thank you

1046
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,619
okay

1047
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:16,260
uh I guess the one of the main issues

1048
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,240
that was actually raised in both

1049
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,339
comments for Gen art and art art was

1050
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:22,980
regarding the references to skip two

1051
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,300
tenants references to skip 214

1052
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,559
both of these groups wanted them to be

1053
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,819
normative

1054
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:32,700
um however I believe that this group

1055
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,839
actually

1056
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,240
determined way back when that these

1057
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,940
would be informational documents

1058
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,540
um

1059
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,240
as far as we go as far as our opinion it

1060
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,920
doesn't really matter to us I guess it's

1061
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,780
just a matter of coming to our

1062
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,300
resolution on this as far as which

1063
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,059
type of reference this should be

1064
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:53,599
Bernard

1065
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,059
yeah um as you've said I think many

1066
00:47:57,059 --> 00:47:59,460
times this document is not the

1067
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,260
documentation of skip

1068
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,140
so it's it's merely the documentation of

1069
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,319
of essentially the sdp so I don't think

1070
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:10,200
it's the the comment says you you need

1071
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,640
it to implement skip but I don't think

1072
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,619
that's necessarily relevant which is why

1073
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,599
we allowed it to be informational

1074
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,980
so there may be a little bit of

1075
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,420
misunderstanding there on the part of

1076
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,160
the reviewer as to as to what the

1077
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,619
document is actually doing

1078
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:25,020
okay all right then we'll we'll keep it

1079
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,260
as informational reference uh at this

1080
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,059
point

1081
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:31,380
okay

1082
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,380
uh next slide

1083
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,559
foreign

1084
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:39,480
group mentioned that 214 has only

1085
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,119
mentioned uh at one point in the

1086
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,559
document

1087
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:44,339
um

1088
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,559
we've discussed possibly even removing

1089
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,040
the reference to 214.2 from

1090
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,040
from this document only because it's

1091
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,859
internally skip 214 is really a

1092
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:58,800
precursor to this upcoming RFC if you

1093
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,099
will so it's kind of

1094
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:04,800
can go away if you will I guess the only

1095
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,900
issue I saw with that is that it is

1096
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,460
actually referenced in the Guyana

1097
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,440
registration

1098
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,200
um so we'd I guess as part of that

1099
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,760
update and it kind of leads into another

1100
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,280
question later on about also about the

1101
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,099
Ianna registration about how that would

1102
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:23,040
affect if we do decide to remove the

1103
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,280
skip 214 reference from our document

1104
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,200
Bernard

1105
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,359
yeah I think you could remove it and

1106
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:33,180
then update the registration

1107
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,040
um since it seems like all the comments

1108
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,319
refer to the references having as few as

1109
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,260
possible just I might just say to some

1110
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,619
hassle

1111
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,300
you know do you do you need this

1112
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,099
reference does it is it

1113
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:49,920
you know uh really necessary to

1114
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,359
understand the document and as you've

1115
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,319
said I for 214 I think the answer is no

1116
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:58,140
um right like I said it was kind of a

1117
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,240
for internally for our for our working

1118
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,859
group The skip working group it was

1119
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:05,040
really a precursor to to this reference

1120
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,059
and it

1121
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:08,460
and it's its content is essentially what

1122
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,520
this RFC is so it can kind of go away if

1123
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,480
you will from from our from this ietf

1124
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,859
document so

1125
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:20,400
the the other way to think of it though

1126
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,280
is also the fact that the that

1127
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,520
while the information presented in 214.2

1128
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,420
and this draft Ric are are

1129
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,480
nearly identical the communities that

1130
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,480
will actually use them

1131
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,440
um

1132
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,300
are different and their references are

1133
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,180
are more relevant you know the RFC is

1134
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,579
meant for people outside of our skip

1135
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,760
Community who are building products that

1136
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,099
have to carry our payloads

1137
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:57,180
um and that's what they need to build to

1138
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:03,300
the the skip is references for ecu's end

1139
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,359
units that will be implementing the full

1140
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:09,540
scope of a bunch of other skip documents

1141
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,079
um

1142
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,720
and this would be the only place that

1143
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,260
provides a tie-in for that for those

1144
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,020
functions so

1145
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,660
remove it if it gets this along that's

1146
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,559
great otherwise it is the tie-in to the

1147
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,099
community the skip community and the uh

1148
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,680
the networking Community yeah I mean I

1149
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,559
think go ahead sorry partner

1150
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,540
yeah I guess my only question would be

1151
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,980
you know just it's a maintenance

1152
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,800
question you know are you gonna uh you

1153
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,599
know what if you decide to do an update

1154
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,339
for video or something are you gonna do

1155
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:46,800
it in the skip 214 series like have a

1156
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,099
DOT three are you gonna update this

1157
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:51,599
document that that might be the only

1158
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,339
reason it's relevant is if you're trying

1159
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,440
to point someone to it but if this

1160
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,020
document really kind of supersedes and

1161
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,720
Obsolete 214.2 and there's no plan to

1162
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,160
have a DOT three or that four or

1163
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,819
something

1164
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,220
then it seems like the reference is

1165
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,140
gratuitous

1166
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,260
yeah I I I can see it both ways that's

1167
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,880
the only way I bring it up but because

1168
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,440
it the RFC won't won't uh obsolete the

1169
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,900
document to our community

1170
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,920
um but yeah I think the only and the

1171
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,960
only alternative I would have is just uh

1172
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,000
I mean if you are do want to keep it in

1173
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,220
just mention it somewhere outside the

1174
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,020
abstract just mention it in the

1175
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,220
introduction or something saying hey

1176
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,200
this used to be defined by 214.2 but

1177
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,119
this supersedes that or something like

1178
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,339
that so just just so it's more clear to

1179
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:40,380
people where what the document is you

1180
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,180
know they're just as it says like so

1181
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,500
it's mentioned somewhere besides the

1182
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,059
abstract and the registration

1183
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:46,980
just you know informationally if you

1184
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,300
want to do that otherwise as I said

1185
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,920
taking it out would be fine

1186
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,839
yeah if you're in agreement I think

1187
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,579
we'll probably just to remove it

1188
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:56,880
yeah that sounds fine to me

1189
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,640
okay all right thanks uh next slide

1190
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,280
and back to the back to the registration

1191
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,359
here I guess the question was uh

1192
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,119
the sections five one and five two of

1193
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:14,880
this document are basically a if you

1194
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,540
will the Ina registration

1195
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,720
um we did do that earlier

1196
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,500
before we before we submitted this uh

1197
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,160
draft uh skip drafts that we did

1198
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,680
register the payload types first I think

1199
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,839
the question was

1200
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,599
um as far as updating the Ina

1201
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:38,640
registration for this was

1202
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,400
or having it also repeated if you will

1203
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,920
in our document in this document

1204
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,880
um

1205
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,040
I guess it was they've talked it one of

1206
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,660
the questions was about how to update

1207
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,059
contact information and things like that

1208
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:52,980
about

1209
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,480
um that I don't know if we could throw

1210
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,000
that question out there to

1211
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,319
um

1212
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,059
talk about the first year I guess what

1213
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:02,280
the process is if there is a process for

1214
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,980
updating contact if that's yeah and I

1215
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,559
think that if the uh the goal of this

1216
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:08,880
document is to change these

1217
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,380
registrations to refer to this document

1218
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,020
rather than 214.2 so I think if you

1219
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,000
explicitly say on both the bullets on

1220
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,960
this slide

1221
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,000
this you know Updates this registration

1222
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,380
to be

1223
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,260
this document rather than

1224
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,119
the the previous registration I think

1225
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:25,260
that that it should be fun then you're

1226
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,400
not repeating but and you're not

1227
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,020
repeating the registration you're

1228
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,220
changing the registration and that's

1229
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,900
fine

1230
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,720
right and I guess that would because

1231
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,400
there's also there's actually algebra

1232
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,640
reference it points to 214.2 in that I

1233
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,799
enter registration so

1234
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,599
we I mean that section would have to be

1235
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:45,359
updated sorry uh but have to be updated

1236
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,619
to remove that

1237
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:49,520
remove those references as well so yeah

1238
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,760
not a big deal so yeah

1239
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,200
so yeah I think that should that should

1240
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,059
be fun

1241
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,440
as long as it's clear that this is this

1242
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,640
is do this is not repeating something

1243
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,720
that's already exists it's doing

1244
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,740
something new

1245
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,180
it should be fun

1246
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:08,400
right right and I gotta assisted

1247
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,160
the comment for it that the section

1248
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,079
seven and this the second bullet there

1249
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:16,380
about adding instructions to Ayanna to

1250
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,240
point to this document when it becomes

1251
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,880
an RFC rather than the those those

1252
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,559
things I guess it's just about a

1253
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,140
sentence or two or whatever there's a

1254
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,180
specific language I need to use or

1255
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,640
whatever for them to recognize that or

1256
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,000
yeah

1257
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,480
so yeah okay all right I guess that's

1258
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,260
that next slide

1259
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,260
uh

1260
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,299
yes so I don't know Mike I don't know if

1261
00:55:45,299 --> 00:55:46,559
you want to wrap this up here I guess

1262
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,440
this is yeah we were there were some

1263
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,359
comments received that were more

1264
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,559
narrative

1265
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,200
um and they were not incorporated as

1266
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,660
they they don't impact the technical

1267
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,200
information necessary to Port skip they

1268
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,940
were references to the intro the

1269
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,220
abstract and background information

1270
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,980
where references were occurring and and

1271
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:12,780
I it was it was I guess I I not to be

1272
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,099
quite blunt but you know someone's

1273
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:15,780
opinion that that doesn't really impact

1274
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,579
what we really want people to

1275
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:19,140
concentrate on which is the technical

1276
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,020
information so I I didn't want to start

1277
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,059
moving stuff around for the sake of one

1278
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:25,799
person's opinion

1279
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,980
um and it it doesn't really it's just a

1280
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,500
story and anyone can tell the story in

1281
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,000
different ways

1282
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,980
so we left it it just seemed like an

1283
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,720
easier way to go

1284
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,940
um and the comments which impact the

1285
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,680
technical understanding that were

1286
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,960
discussed here with the resolution we'll

1287
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,119
put that into the draft RFC we would

1288
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,740
look for you know Dan was asking for

1289
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,599
information of how to approach Diana

1290
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:51,780
about uh updating what is presently

1291
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,420
there to reflect well for instance an

1292
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,700
RFC number when we get it here but you

1293
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,619
know that we didn't know what the

1294
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:01,260
specific procedures who to contact and

1295
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,119
how to do that so we may be looking for

1296
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,280
guidance there

1297
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,180
um

1298
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,599
and you know after that we

1299
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,819
um you know we can update this document

1300
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,760
and we can update Diana in parallel once

1301
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,680
we have something of an RFC number to

1302
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,359
tell them to put into place but what are

1303
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:21,980
the next steps what's next after this

1304
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,540
um

1305
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,119
go ahead

1306
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:31,859
yeah I mean

1307
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:34,260
um I think it's it's basically the main

1308
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:37,559
thing here is the update the Ayana uh in

1309
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:40,079
uh registration section to do the things

1310
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,880
we talked about

1311
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,400
um in terms of next steps Beyond this it

1312
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,220
would be the shepherd write-up

1313
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,599
um the issue we're having I think right

1314
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:51,480
now is I think it's stabilizing they've

1315
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,220
changed a bunch of the questions and and

1316
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,700
the shepherding procedure uh but as soon

1317
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,680
as uh but that would be The Next Step

1318
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,079
Beyond this once you've submitted a a

1319
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:03,359
new draft I guess the sector review is

1320
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,160
still outstanding but hopefully that'll

1321
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,380
show up at some point

1322
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,880
um but I don't think we have to wait for

1323
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,480
that to show up

1324
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,520
right yeah because I wasn't quite clear

1325
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,460
about exactly from the art art review

1326
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,160
exactly what specific things that they

1327
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,599
said that were a problem that would

1328
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,059
prevent this from moving forward

1329
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:25,799
I mean there was there was a comment

1330
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:28,020
about some of the initial language up

1331
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,700
front the boilerplate

1332
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:35,280
uh documents for the 20 21-19 reference

1333
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,220
um and we changed that but they just I

1334
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,079
guess we were not clear about exactly

1335
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,040
which

1336
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,319
which particular issues that were raised

1337
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,420
that were showstoppers for for that

1338
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,079
group so

1339
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,819
yeah it would be the I think the the

1340
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,559
ones you do have to fix are the Ayanna

1341
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,079
issues

1342
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,819
okay and and you know the references

1343
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:58,200
which we just talked about so I think

1344
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,460
we've pretty much gone over everything

1345
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,839
that would be

1346
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:02,819
you know uh would be an impediment to

1347
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:04,319
moving forward

1348
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,000
okay

1349
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,020
all right we'll get that updated review

1350
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,140
probably next week I guess we'll see if

1351
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,059
we can get version two out

1352
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:18,619
great all right

1353
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:23,720
okay I think that's it

1354
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,059
yeah I think thank you very much Bernard

1355
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:28,799
thank you

1356
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,079
okay uh so we'll try to make this quick

1357
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:34,260
this is an update on 7983 bits next

1358
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,559
slide

1359
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,079
so uh I think you've all heard what this

1360
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,700
is basically about it's attempt to

1361
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,599
Multiplex quick with srtp srtcp start

1362
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,540
and turn dtls and zrtp

1363
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,040
um

1364
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,859
and it does include an update to dtls

1365
00:59:52,859 --> 00:59:55,740
content field with no other change next

1366
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,040
slide

1367
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,240
so the working good last call completed

1368
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,520
on June 6th we got uh three major

1369
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,440
comments

1370
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,260
um one was from Martin who was concerned

1371
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,480
that uh some of the text had quick

1372
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,940
version dependencies for example we

1373
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,680
explicitly mentioned the quick short and

1374
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,119
long headers which could conceivably

1375
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,059
change in some uh future version

1376
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:20,880
uh David pointed out that uh we our

1377
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,200
language about the quick greasing was uh

1378
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,380
somewhat vague and suggested a much more

1379
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,540
specific language don't send the the

1380
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,640
transport parameter

1381
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,559
um another question he raised was

1382
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,420
relating to the multiplexing of churn

1383
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,520
channels and quick

1384
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,059
um and Jonathan also chimed in on that

1385
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:43,319
uh which and I'll talk a little bit

1386
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:45,180
about the resolution but it's basically

1387
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,579
along the lines Jonathan suggested which

1388
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:49,980
is that um the overlap between turn

1389
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,720
channels and Quake isn't actually a big

1390
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,059
problem because the turn channel package

1391
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:55,500
should only come from a turn server so

1392
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,660
we'll talk about that in a little bit uh

1393
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,399
a little bit more on next slide

1394
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:04,200
so this is the updated diagram it's

1395
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,640
basically the same as what we had before

1396
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,740
but we took out references to the quick

1397
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,079
short and long headers basically we just

1398
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,000
say forward it to quick and then

1399
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,440
whatever quick version you happen to

1400
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,240
have will figure out what what those

1401
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,280
packets mean assuming it's it's getting

1402
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,380
it's being forwarded correctly so we

1403
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,180
don't really have to put in version

1404
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,400
specific things here

1405
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,079
um and so that's the change in the

1406
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:28,160
diagram next

1407
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:32,160
so uh in terms of changes uh we had

1408
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,140
major changes were in section one and

1409
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,359
section two

1410
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,000
and in section one we basically said hey

1411
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,339
we are compatible with quick version two

1412
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:44,700
the in the in its draft form uh but not

1413
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,220
with the quick bit greasing and as a

1414
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,500
result you must not send that transport

1415
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,359
parameter

1416
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,220
um and then in section two this is where

1417
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,859
we uh talk about the overlap between

1418
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:58,079
turn channels and quick and how to deal

1419
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,299
with it so this kind of is is uh

1420
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,099
important text

1421
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:04,140
um and basically what we're saying here

1422
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,819
is along the lines of what Jonathan

1423
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:07,260
suggested which is that the overlap

1424
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,359
isn't a real problem

1425
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:10,740
um because you would only get the turn

1426
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,079
Channel packets from a turn server

1427
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:17,280
uh and what what that means is you

1428
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,559
basically as Jonathan said in this

1429
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:21,720
message you only really need to be able

1430
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,619
to disambaguate the turn from uh

1431
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:27,599
disambiguate stun

1432
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,619
um and then the other one is is

1433
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:34,980
disambiguating srtp srtcp zrp dtls are

1434
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,480
quick

1435
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,020
um

1436
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,960
uh which won't be sent from from a

1437
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,599
source in IP and Port that had responded

1438
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:44,160
to a turn allocation

1439
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,619
so it is a little bit different from the

1440
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:48,960
previous the multiplexing advice uh in

1441
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,900
in 7983 and that you do need to keep

1442
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,480
track of the turn server IP addresses

1443
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,520
and ports uh to be able to do the

1444
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,520
demultiplexing but I think if you do

1445
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,579
that it is uh the overlap is not an

1446
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:04,880
issue

1447
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,819
and and you can un Ambiguously uh

1448
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:10,440
demultiplex

1449
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,299
that's a very good summary of what I

1450
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:15,240
suggested so great thank you okay

1451
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,299
so uh the question here is have we

1452
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:20,220
addressed everything uh in particular

1453
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,280
this this overlap uh between stun uh

1454
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,039
between turn and quick

1455
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:28,260
um and if not is there anything else we

1456
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,680
need to address to kind of address all

1457
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,839
of the working group last call uh issues

1458
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,440
that were brought up

1459
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,799
you know

1460
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,700
I personally I think we're probably

1461
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,660
ready

1462
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,319
um

1463
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:47,819
and I guess since you're the author I

1464
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:50,520
can take over shepherding it

1465
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,380
um

1466
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,059
anybody

1467
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:57,500
object otherwise we'll go ahead

1468
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,539
great

1469
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:06,619
thank you for that thank you

1470
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,980
okay uh RTP over quick

1471
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,539
who's doing this not this

1472
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:23,880
uh yeah

1473
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:28,700
uh no turn that on

1474
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,400
enter yeah okay

1475
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,680
so we have a short update on RTP real

1476
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,359
quick um I will first go through the

1477
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:38,039
updates we did between the last

1478
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:39,299
interview meeting and the call for

1479
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:41,339
adoption and then later look at some of

1480
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:44,640
the open issues and proposed Solutions

1481
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,779
uh next slide please

1482
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,280
so we added a scope section at the

1483
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,900
beginning of the draft which explains

1484
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:58,339
that this draft is to or aiming to

1485
01:04:58,339 --> 01:05:00,799
describe a minimum I think for our

1486
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:04,500
application usage of RTP overclick we

1487
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,180
try to do the minimal stuff first and

1488
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,859
then we can go to more complex scenarios

1489
01:05:07,859 --> 01:05:08,720
later

1490
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,480
the Baseline here expects that we have a

1491
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,760
standard quick implementation but it can

1492
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,000
benefit from Quick extensions

1493
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,140
and we describe some of the

1494
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,460
optimizations we can do to RTP over

1495
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,799
quick when we have some of these quick

1496
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:29,400
extensions and redescribe what API

1497
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,420
um

1498
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,280
what the API of a quick implementation

1499
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,260
could offer to implement these

1500
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:36,859
optimizations

1501
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,660
um we are limiting this to RTP over

1502
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,660
quick without doing any changes to quick

1503
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,539
or RTP and the signaling is to be done

1504
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:47,599
in a separate way

1505
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,059
example it could be STP for RTP overpric

1506
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:52,500
which we'll look at later

1507
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,220
next slide

1508
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,180
then there was a discussion on the

1509
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,099
mailing list that we need an alpn we

1510
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:01,680
have added a section for this in the I

1511
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,260
think in the beginning of the draft

1512
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,539
um that an alpn is required by click to

1513
01:06:06,539 --> 01:06:08,280
set up a connection and we defined

1514
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,700
r2pmox quick to indicate that this

1515
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,720
um

1516
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,500
that it would be possible to Multiplex

1517
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,900
different flows next to RTP on the same

1518
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,640
quick connection

1519
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,799
um we will go back to that later and uh

1520
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,980
issue I will talk about later on a slide

1521
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,859
and we

1522
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,900
added similar to other drafts defining

1523
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,660
alpn's subsection which is to be removed

1524
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,079
later to add a suffix to the alpn as

1525
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:39,780
long as this is in draft state so that

1526
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,599
one can identify the draft which is

1527
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:44,160
identified by this LPN

1528
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,059
the draft version next slide please

1529
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:51,020
we added a section on API considerations

1530
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:54,660
which basically lists a set of features

1531
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,180
which quick implementations can provide

1532
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,680
to help implementing certain

1533
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,500
optimizations the section is split into

1534
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,680
two subsection one is listing

1535
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,240
information so that's a quick

1536
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,460
implementation or the quick stack could

1537
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:13,039
expose to the application layer to help

1538
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:17,520
implementing the optimizations in RTP

1539
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,500
uh that includes for example the MDU

1540
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,119
size to send datagrams of the correct

1541
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:21,980
size

1542
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,880
acknowledgments as

1543
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,339
they are listed in the rtcp section

1544
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:28,740
which we talked about already earlier

1545
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,000
um

1546
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,920
things like stream States so we added

1547
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,140
streams in the last meeting I talked

1548
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,420
about that I think and if we are using

1549
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,099
streams then we need to know something

1550
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:41,039
like how far is the stream progress so

1551
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:44,339
it's a RTP packet um

1552
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:47,039
completely sent or is it not so that the

1553
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,780
RDP implementation or the application

1554
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,099
implementation can make a decision

1555
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,200
whether it wants to keep the stream open

1556
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,119
to allow for re-transmissions or whether

1557
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,400
it wants to cancel the stream because

1558
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,830
it's too late to transmit the packets

1559
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,299
[Music]

1560
01:08:00,299 --> 01:08:01,740
um

1561
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:04,500
and then the second second

1562
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,200
subsection of the API considerations

1563
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,440
um lists some methods that could be

1564
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,720
exposed by a quick implementation such

1565
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,660
as canceling streams if we want to or

1566
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,979
for example setting congestion

1567
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:18,839
controllers

1568
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:21,920
next slide please

1569
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:26,939
other options which are a little changes

1570
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:29,540
in the sections which are already there

1571
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,640
re-restrict RTP sessions for now to use

1572
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,500
either quick streams or quick datagrams

1573
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,020
not both at the same time

1574
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,120
um different RTP sessions can use Quick

1575
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,299
streams and datagrams so just not within

1576
01:08:42,299 --> 01:08:45,560
one session

1577
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,339
and then we add some implementation

1578
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:53,698
applications about the

1579
01:08:53,698 --> 01:08:56,520
mapping from Quick statistics to rtcp

1580
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,100
when quick streams are used I think I

1581
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,238
already mentioned this in the last

1582
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:02,399
meeting that in this case the

1583
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,540
connections are not exactly what is in

1584
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,100
the network because due to

1585
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,658
retransmissions

1586
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:11,179
we

1587
01:09:11,179 --> 01:09:13,679
have other statistics then we would have

1588
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,259
if we would use rtcp and we added an

1589
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:18,960
amplification tutorial node to the draft

1590
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,479
that an application should be aware of

1591
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:23,279
this it might be what the applicant

1592
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,580
application wants to know but it

1593
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,658
needs to keep in mind that this is not

1594
01:09:27,658 --> 01:09:31,158
exactly what rtcp would give

1595
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,080
uh then we have a little subsection

1596
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,000
about congestion control considerations

1597
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,799
when a quick connection is shared

1598
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:38,698
between

1599
01:09:38,698 --> 01:09:40,259
um

1600
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:44,238
RTP sessions and other

1601
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:48,500
data streams so yeah well

1602
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:51,120
yeah just a question about the first

1603
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,238
point um what's the uh what's the point

1604
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:56,520
of the restriction on not being able to

1605
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,840
use uh streams and datagrams

1606
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,480
simultaneously uh for now as far as it

1607
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,500
was just

1608
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,600
um because we wanted to do the simple

1609
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,159
thing first we are not exactly sure what

1610
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,140
the implications are if one session is

1611
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,000
using both and we might loosen this

1612
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,620
restriction later I would say but we

1613
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:13,320
were just not clear about what the

1614
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,600
implications are of this okay so just

1615
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,360
just FYI in in some other

1616
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,580
um and some other usages of media over

1617
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,860
quick like like in Mock and quicker we

1618
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,440
are actively sending both uh streams and

1619
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,820
datagrams and we see a lot of use cases

1620
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:28,199
where that that actually has some

1621
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:32,280
benefits yeah thanks

1622
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,760
I see there's someone else in this here

1623
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,340
but I can't read the name from here uh

1624
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,719
no I think that's just I didn't oh

1625
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:41,219
Bernard

1626
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:43,980
yeah um so I did want to follow up on

1627
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:46,020
What mo was talking about you know

1628
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,460
particularly when you when you're

1629
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,199
bundling things together right there

1630
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,020
might be uh you might you might have a

1631
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,580
bunch of things on the same quick

1632
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:56,580
connection you might be sending data

1633
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,500
um and that actually led me to a

1634
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,179
question about the alpn you know you're

1635
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:03,239
suggesting RTP mux but you might also be

1636
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:06,000
sending data on that connection

1637
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,100
um presumably if you're sending data you

1638
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,719
still would want the the same congestion

1639
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:12,000
control for example if you're if you're

1640
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,219
doing audio and video and you're sending

1641
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:17,340
data that data you know might well use

1642
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,260
the same low latency algorithm right you

1643
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:22,560
don't necessarily care uh that and the

1644
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,060
algorithm would take care of of

1645
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,580
multiplexing those two things so anyway

1646
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:30,000
I think the main thing is uh it would be

1647
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,679
good to actually have some goals in

1648
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:32,940
there to address some of the questions

1649
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,040
that Mo had

1650
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,719
um so that we're clear about what what

1651
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,400
we're trying what the scope of what

1652
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,020
we're trying to do is

1653
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:41,640
um and why we're imposing some of these

1654
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,199
restrictions so that we can understand

1655
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:46,699
whether we want them or not

1656
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,100
just to clarify that the use cases that

1657
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,500
I had in mind were sending audio as

1658
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,040
datagrams and video as streams or a

1659
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,780
complex video stream layered video

1660
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,620
stream uh the dependent layers as uh

1661
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,360
streams and the independent layers of

1662
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,980
streams and the dependent layers as

1663
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,900
datagrams those are the specific

1664
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,620
examples that I was at

1665
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,840
I've seen I've seen usage similar usage

1666
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,600
where the base layer is sent as reliable

1667
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,580
uh and the upper layers are sent as

1668
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:23,059
datagrams

1669
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:24,420
yeah

1670
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:27,780
yeah you're good just quickly on this

1671
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,840
um we have that on our radar as as much

1672
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,340
as said

1673
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:34,739
um it's

1674
01:12:34,739 --> 01:12:36,900
since there is different ways of how you

1675
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,120
could prioritize one thing over the

1676
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,040
other the quick datagram graph currently

1677
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,659
says so if there's a datagram coming you

1678
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,460
sent that first there's a bunch of

1679
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,460
implications to be understood and uh

1680
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,020
this is what we currently have on our

1681
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,420
agenda of trying to figure out

1682
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,060
um so there is not a

1683
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,000
um a disagreement with this idea but uh

1684
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,760
it's it's not completely obvious uh what

1685
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,440
kind of feature interaction it's been

1686
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,880
using both at the same time for

1687
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,640
different things would there would be

1688
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,000
that's all yeah um and in fact uh we've

1689
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,140
seen some of these algorithms

1690
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,640
implemented and they didn't have the

1691
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,100
effect that was intended uh for example

1692
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,659
saying you send the datagrams right away

1693
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:17,280
doesn't necessarily as I think you

1694
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,019
pointed out mean you get low delay

1695
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,000
so it sounds like there's interest in

1696
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,860
that but perhaps you know it needs more

1697
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:28,639
investigation

1698
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,340
okay then we added considerations on

1699
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,199
connection migration and zero rtt in our

1700
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:36,600
discussion section and some minimal

1701
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,060
consideration security considerations

1702
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:42,020
next slide please

1703
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,699
there are currently four open issues in

1704
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:47,820
the GitHub repository

1705
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:50,000
um

1706
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:54,179
so one thing which we have not as a data

1707
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,040
repository first um in the GitHub

1708
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,040
repository first translators forwarding

1709
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,260
UDP packets

1710
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:03,840
from or rtps packets over UDP received

1711
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,260
via RTP over quick are bound to the MTU

1712
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:10,080
of the UDP packet and

1713
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,719
in our current draft it says that we can

1714
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:15,840
use streams for RTP packets where one

1715
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,420
RTP packet is sent on one screen and

1716
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,520
that could potentially be larger than

1717
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,739
the MTU in the UDP

1718
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:24,719
um which it's being forwarded to so that

1719
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:28,140
is one problem that we might have to

1720
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,140
solve then two issues for which we

1721
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,159
already have

1722
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:33,659
um pull requests in the GitHub

1723
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:35,040
repository the first one is with

1724
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,360
transmission flow IDs there was a

1725
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:40,140
question that on which Pro ID RTP packet

1726
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,560
has to be retransmitted and I would say

1727
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,500
that is up to where a rich RTP screen

1728
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,360
that

1729
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,300
RTP packet is re-transmitted in and then

1730
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,460
the flow ID will be that of this RTP

1731
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,940
session

1732
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,179
um

1733
01:14:57,179 --> 01:14:58,679
then there was a question about which

1734
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:00,719
screen times we're using and we added a

1735
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,340
pull request which says that we are

1736
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,780
actually only using unidirectional

1737
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,480
because we intend to close the stream as

1738
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,280
soon as the RTP packet is transmitted

1739
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,140
and then

1740
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,540
um that case we don't have any data

1741
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:13,560
flowing in the other direction because

1742
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,300
we cancel the stream after close the

1743
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,100
stream afterwards anyway so we're using

1744
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,380
unidirectional screens

1745
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,540
um Chevron

1746
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,940
this is regarding the first bullet they

1747
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:26,100
are translated for voting brackets over

1748
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,100
UDP my suggestion

1749
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,199
without really fully understanding what

1750
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,699
you're doing there my suggestion is to

1751
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:34,860
not over engineer right

1752
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:37,620
um sender stupidity is something

1753
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:41,400
you can't design against yeah if if a

1754
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,620
sender if you are in a scenario and

1755
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,360
which you will be probably in the next

1756
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,060
10 or 20 years uh whether maybe a

1757
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,460
Gateway involved that that speaks UDP on

1758
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,659
the other side

1759
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:55,620
and Center is stupid enough to create uh

1760
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:58,500
packets that are that are megabyte long

1761
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:02,100
well tough right business will take care

1762
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,800
of that okay

1763
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,219
thanks

1764
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:14,940
this is Spencer Dawkins uh we talked

1765
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,199
with uh

1766
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:18,840
that's a little uh a little bit about

1767
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,900
this earlier today I think and uh

1768
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:23,940
one of the things I was suggesting was

1769
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,920
that there's lots of different kinds of

1770
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,860
RTP translators in Little Boxes

1771
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,960
uh looks like there's an RFC full of

1772
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,500
them and for us to be real in addition

1773
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,739
to what Stefan was saying uh it's good

1774
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:40,679
to be real clear on what kind of middle

1775
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:41,640
box

1776
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,159
we're talking about here because

1777
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,199
there's lots of them and there's

1778
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:48,239
probably one or two that we might have

1779
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:49,260
in mind

1780
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:52,620
for use with uh RTP with uh RTP over

1781
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:54,920
quick

1782
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,020
uh yeah I think we'll look into this

1783
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,440
Brown

1784
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,020
there's a bunch of things here uh that

1785
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,960
that this group is doing or may do that

1786
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,560
may have impact on RTP topologies

1787
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,600
um so it may be worth thinking about how

1788
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,699
to get that information somewhere

1789
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:16,860
I'm thinking in particular about intent

1790
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,659
encryption there may be situations where

1791
01:17:18,659 --> 01:17:21,360
you know a main can't wouldn't be able

1792
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,060
to adjust the MTU size or anything like

1793
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,560
that and I think this is just one of

1794
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,640
them

1795
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,600
um

1796
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,960
so just something to think about

1797
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,800
it thanks

1798
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:39,659
okay then the last two issues are

1799
01:17:39,659 --> 01:17:41,100
um two issues to which we don't have

1800
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,600
Solutions yet the first one is

1801
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,159
considerations about stream concurrency

1802
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,159
because in quick uh we need the sender

1803
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:50,159
needs credits to open streams and the

1804
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,020
receiver has to provide enough credits

1805
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,120
for that and Lucas if I do opened this

1806
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,760
issue and suggested that we should add

1807
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,140
some considerations about that because

1808
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,960
it limits the amount of parallel rgp

1809
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,760
packets which are currently being

1810
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,900
transmitted

1811
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,480
and um

1812
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,060
we should probably give some guidance on

1813
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,659
this how a receiver has to manage this

1814
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:15,000
and then the last one is also from Lucas

1815
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,020
Potter is

1816
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,179
um what happens if datagrams are not

1817
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:19,739
enabled and

1818
01:18:19,739 --> 01:18:21,920
he's addressed that we could

1819
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,260
encode something for this case in the

1820
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:27,540
alpn tokens or create multiple alpn

1821
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,580
tokens for example to let senders and

1822
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,440
receivers negotiate and the connection

1823
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,840
establishment what kind of transmission

1824
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,520
they are going to use streams or

1825
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,100
datagrams or use transfer parameters for

1826
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,960
that and

1827
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,620
um

1828
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:43,140
but then we also have the external

1829
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,760
signaling for

1830
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,920
um setting or negotiating the sessions

1831
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:51,000
probably in sdp for example and what

1832
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,040
what would happen if I for example

1833
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,199
negotiate something in sdp and then the

1834
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,420
connection setup does something else so

1835
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:01,140
that's an issue we are having in the

1836
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,820
GitHub repositories currently and we

1837
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,199
don't exactly know how to resolve this

1838
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:05,880
yet

1839
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,920
um yeah but I think these are the

1840
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,980
current issues so if there's input from

1841
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,300
the working group that would be probably

1842
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,860
quite helpful

1843
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:14,520
um

1844
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,960
and then next slide

1845
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,300
so um as the next steps or recent steps

1846
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,100
we submitted a working group draft this

1847
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,380
week and then we're going to continue

1848
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,659
with it working with Spencer and the sdp

1849
01:19:27,659 --> 01:19:30,259
signaling

1850
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,980
um yeah I think that's all I have for

1851
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,239
now

1852
01:19:33,239 --> 01:19:36,620
and you know

1853
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,120
um just a comment in in the web transfer

1854
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,260
working group we also talked about

1855
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,120
whether datagrams should be required and

1856
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,560
it was pointed out that this is very

1857
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,440
easy to implement in quick so there's no

1858
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,239
real excuse for not doing it in a

1859
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,820
quicker momentation so the thinking was

1860
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,380
just require it you know in the

1861
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:54,659
transport parameter and and just get it

1862
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:56,159
up you know get it over with there

1863
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,020
whether you use it or not an sap is a

1864
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:59,760
different story but at the quick layer

1865
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,560
just require that they do datagrams

1866
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:09,560
foreign

1867
01:20:18,199 --> 01:20:23,960
anything else on this or else Spencer

1868
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,900
thank you

1869
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:50,340
so I'm Spencer Dawkins and I'm um

1870
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:54,900
the follow-on to Mathis and York

1871
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,620
um next slide please

1872
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,460
so basically remembering that

1873
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:05,699
um Michael with an individual draft was

1874
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:09,179
to do a minimal sdpa specification which

1875
01:21:09,179 --> 01:21:12,840
roughly tracks uh the draft that has now

1876
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,560
been adopted by the ABC core working

1877
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,199
group

1878
01:21:18,199 --> 01:21:20,940
and to track

1879
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:23,219
more high level issues in a separate

1880
01:21:23,219 --> 01:21:25,040
repo

1881
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,960
that I think a lot of the discussion

1882
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,320
will not end up in the minimals STP

1883
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,639
specification

1884
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:33,960
so

1885
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,420
um fsitf I'm providing an update based

1886
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:39,780
on the it was I was actually looking at

1887
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:42,540
Dash four of the International Drive but

1888
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,239
I think the only change was the name

1889
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:48,250
to reflect adoption and

1890
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:48,600
[Music]

1891
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,739
um

1892
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:52,679
please feel free to provide feedback to

1893
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:57,300
on the mayoral list also and my Congress

1894
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,760
to ensure

1895
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:02,520
one of the minimal specification before

1896
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,699
our next WT Corps meeting

1897
01:22:05,699 --> 01:22:07,800
um eventually I think would be good for

1898
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,520
me to request an option of

1899
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,699
a normal specification so

1900
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:18,239
uh but I'm not doing that at this time

1901
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:21,080
um next slide please

1902
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:24,540
so

1903
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:28,080
what ABC core sorry AVP

1904
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,560
profiles to register was uh issue number

1905
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,659
five uh

1906
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:35,580
first off the last General was to

1907
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,820
register one profile uh quick RTP

1908
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,840
absolute pef and

1909
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,060
noting that the secure IDP profiles are

1910
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:48,420
most useful when bridging to non-quick

1911
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:52,500
or TCP RTP and uh

1912
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,719
we were saying that we won't have that

1913
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,960
conversation or revise the RTP

1914
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,380
topologies RC and of course I forgot to

1915
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,780
prepare UDP for consistency in the

1916
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:06,900
registry my apologies and then other

1917
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,600
related questions started popping up a

1918
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,360
lot about datagrams strange sources

1919
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,300
datagrams on the next slide and uh where

1920
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:19,620
we need ice TCP which is a real issue

1921
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:23,000
next slide please

1922
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,130
so

1923
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:27,600
[Music]

1924
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,440
um

1925
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,719
let's say about RDP other streams

1926
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,400
datagrams are both chosed up in a couple

1927
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,020
of places

1928
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:36,179
um the issue in a parade in Issue Number

1929
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:39,179
Nine uh or sorry number three

1930
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:42,179
um right now

1931
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:44,219
uh

1932
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:48,860
there's discussion of including a

1933
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:53,699
shared capability as well in the draft

1934
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:56,400
we've adopted although I'm getting

1935
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,520
slightly ahead of where the

1936
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:02,100
adopted draft is so my proposal would be

1937
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:05,940
to do extreme datagram and share it if

1938
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,580
we get to Shared uh basically just based

1939
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,620
on the discussion we're heading about

1940
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:13,020
that draft

1941
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,860
next slide please

1942
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:19,980
this is new do we need tcpis uh this is

1943
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,960
from Roman

1944
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,360
um and when

1945
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:27,600
this is my summary of His

1946
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,300
longer explanations that are on list I

1947
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,540
would recommend taking a look at those

1948
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:37,199
um his key Point as I understand it uh

1949
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,780
is that we need we need a way to fall

1950
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:43,199
back to TCP if we can use ice TCP

1951
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,179
candidates we do have a fallback and if

1952
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:47,820
we can't what's the alternative

1953
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:51,360
uh his proposal was to also register TCP

1954
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,060
quick RTP

1955
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:57,300
avpf style profiles and

1956
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:57,960
um

1957
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,000
there's actually a continuing discussion

1958
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,340
since I selected since the slides in on

1959
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,560
the mailing list about well why would we

1960
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,000
not just

1961
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,659
you know go go to RTP over uh over TCP

1962
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:15,659
um like I say uh more working group

1963
01:25:15,659 --> 01:25:19,799
discussion yeah

1964
01:25:21,139 --> 01:25:23,880
just to to point out that that probably

1965
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,980
requires some some fundamental and

1966
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,719
explanation on the list because I

1967
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:29,520
haven't yet fully understood how this

1968
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,500
reason chain of reasoning came into

1969
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:32,699
being that that would need to be

1970
01:25:32,699 --> 01:25:34,980
registered if we are worried about

1971
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,739
running two congestion controls one in

1972
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:40,679
screen or something on top of quick

1973
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:41,340
um

1974
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,719
you should be even more worried about

1975
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,460
running three contrasting controllers on

1976
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,320
top of each other if we tunnel the whole

1977
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,020
thing then to TCP that just doesn't

1978
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:50,760
sound about what we what we would want

1979
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,440
to be doing

1980
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,040
um

1981
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,020
Roman won't let you respond first then

1982
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,699
I'll I guess I put myself in the queue

1983
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:59,480
for as an influential

1984
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,780
ice machinery we're setting up uh calls

1985
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:08,760
they come with certain kind of features

1986
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:10,739
which again haven't been designed for

1987
01:26:10,739 --> 01:26:12,900
RTP over quick they've been designed for

1988
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,760
FTP over UDP

1989
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,900
and uh they come with uh support for

1990
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:23,159
tunneling over TCP or TLS like for

1991
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:26,100
instance if you so if you use turn

1992
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:29,219
servers you are away through a

1993
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:31,080
intermediary server and one of the

1994
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,719
relays can be over TCP to return server

1995
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:35,520
and from turn server over UDP to

1996
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,580
whatever is using uh whatever we use the

1997
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:40,560
party on the other end

1998
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,260
so it's kind of part of ice Machinery uh

1999
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:46,260
the other situation is the other kind of

2000
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:50,100
extension is uh istcp which is where you

2001
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:53,159
try to establish TCP connection uh

2002
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:57,960
between the uh like two eyes or agents

2003
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:02,820
and you tunnel the protocol over a TCP

2004
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:03,719
connection

2005
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:06,120
uh am I guess the mean complicating

2006
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,580
factor that people kind of Miss in all

2007
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:12,480
of this is that the way eyes operate is

2008
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,719
that you can end up for instance with uh

2009
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:17,820
your packets going over HP connection

2010
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,340
and in the process of nomination

2011
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:23,580
your same or a protocol which is running

2012
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,800
on top you can switch to UDP like the

2013
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,440
typical example would be it takes some

2014
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:31,020
time to set up eternally which would be

2015
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,520
over UDP

2016
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,040
so and your istcp candidates will work

2017
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,500
first so like if you start negotiating

2018
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,719
connection over istcp and then you

2019
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:42,780
switch to uh relay through a turn server

2020
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,000
while the protocol is still being set up

2021
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,500
while you're basically sending initial

2022
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,620
packets for media so it's like so it's

2023
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,239
kind of all designed to work together

2024
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:52,620
and

2025
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:55,679
not necessarily ideal for what we're

2026
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:57,900
doing with RTP over quick but if we are

2027
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,300
if we want to use the ice Machinery we

2028
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,699
kind of like stuck with it or we need to

2029
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:06,120
redesign it uh to work differently but

2030
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,699
again that's a fairly heavy uplift

2031
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:11,280
so that's uh that's kind of where this

2032
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,480
whole TTP tunneling comes from and the

2033
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,719
candidate like actually comes from

2034
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,840
working in some of the quirks of sdp ice

2035
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,020
negotiation and that's why I had to add

2036
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:27,719
those uh like TTP versions of protocols

2037
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:33,020
for dtls srtp and uh did like for the

2038
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:36,360
MRCP it's just because of the like in a

2039
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,280
certain sequence of events you and like

2040
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,020
you need to signal that you are sending

2041
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:43,260
stuff over dcpano and that's the only

2042
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:45,480
way to specify it it doesn't

2043
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:48,620
we affect the overall raw protocol but

2044
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,900
it's again not ideal because there are

2045
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:54,739
multiple layers of uh vacuum contest

2046
01:28:54,739 --> 01:28:57,780
there are multiple issues with head of

2047
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:00,239
the line congestion when your tunneling

2048
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,000
over TCP which are again undesirable but

2049
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,100
it's kind of been treated as a uh a tree

2050
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:09,890
that is like is

2051
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:10,980
[Music]

2052
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:14,159
yeah so anyway so it's just if we're

2053
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,620
using ice like we need it if we're not

2054
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,179
using rice we need to come up with

2055
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:21,179
alternative for going through essential

2056
01:29:21,179 --> 01:29:22,340
negotiate

2057
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:27,199
connection from behind that or behind

2058
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,100
yeah

2059
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:32,580
um I I should just make the observation

2060
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:37,080
that uh Roman and I and York are the

2061
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,520
three people that are talking on the

2062
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,620
mailing list right now but the

2063
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:42,540
discussion is happening in a mail in a

2064
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:45,600
through email thread with a not

2065
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,480
particularly obvious subject uh I would

2066
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,659
suggest that uh we plan to do more

2067
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:53,880
discussion on the mailing list which

2068
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,639
will now in our next meeting and uh that

2069
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:58,380
the next person to reply change the

2070
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:00,060
subject

2071
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:01,260
yeah

2072
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,060
um yeah Jonathan Lennox is an individual

2073
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:05,280
I was going to say I mean part of the

2074
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,460
problem is that ice Stacks generally the

2075
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,440
obvious implementation is to get to

2076
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,600
abstractly provide a datagram API and

2077
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,820
then the ice ice stack figures out how

2078
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:17,520
you get end to end so

2079
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,000
um your suggestion of doing RTP over TLS

2080
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,940
well abstractly that would be a cleaner

2081
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:27,239
thing than quick over TCP would be would

2082
01:30:27,239 --> 01:30:29,400
mean we have to feed entirely different

2083
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,260
things down into your stack depending on

2084
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:33,659
what the ice negotiated which would be

2085
01:30:33,659 --> 01:30:36,540
very much a layer violation in terms of

2086
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:40,699
having to know what theri stack is doing

2087
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:43,620
thank you

2088
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:46,340
good night

2089
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:53,820
um yeah uh my comment was that I think

2090
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:56,460
we may not be thinking about this uh at

2091
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,800
a high enough level basically within

2092
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,600
quick we always have to think about

2093
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,860
failover

2094
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:04,380
right and and often that's done at the

2095
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:07,020
app layer so as an example in web

2096
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:10,139
transport we fail over from HTTP 3 to

2097
01:31:10,139 --> 01:31:12,719
http 2.

2098
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,639
um and that does have a whole other

2099
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,500
series of of issues with it because

2100
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:20,219
obviously you can't emulate quick but um

2101
01:31:20,219 --> 01:31:23,159
I I wouldn't mess as as uh horse said I

2102
01:31:23,159 --> 01:31:25,920
running uh you know multiple layers of

2103
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,840
congestion control RTP congestion

2104
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,639
control over quick congestion control

2105
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:31,320
over TCP that's just going to be a

2106
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,840
disaster I wouldn't even want to imagine

2107
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:37,800
to analyze that like bbrv2 over new Reno

2108
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,100
scream over bbrv2 over new Reno uh

2109
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:44,159
thanks yeah I mean the problem is that

2110
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:46,380
the way we have to do the selection is

2111
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:48,000
ice and I don't think we want a new

2112
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,699
selection mechanism in this space

2113
01:31:50,699 --> 01:31:53,340
uh but not I would make the observation

2114
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:57,300
that I was thinking about this roughly

2115
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:00,360
as a quick failover uh thing like you

2116
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,980
were talking about but that was mostly

2117
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,719
because I don't understand ice well

2118
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:06,980
enough to go lower

2119
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:11,520
yeah I I just wanted to suggest that we

2120
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,100
really try to write this down as in as

2121
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:17,159
as emails because I get a stack overflow

2122
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:19,280
when I'm trying to follow that

2123
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,620
that explanation I also want to remark

2124
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:25,980
that back in the days when I my my dim

2125
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:29,520
memory comes twice to remember what I

2126
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,679
had been what we had been doing when I

2127
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,040
was sharing a music at the time

2128
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,960
um you could tell ice what you wanted to

2129
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,540
negotiate right so if we have an API

2130
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:41,280
abstraction problem that's a different

2131
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,560
thing from being a protocol from being a

2132
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:46,020
protocol and signaling problem and we

2133
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,020
shouldn't be getting the letter in the

2134
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:51,060
way of getting the former this other

2135
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:53,480
thing right

2136
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,880
thank you Roman

2137
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,920
after that I'm going to close this

2138
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:03,600
yes again just to reiterate uh again I

2139
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,880
as far as I know with its currently

2140
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,520
limitations cannot uh

2141
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:11,280
include like a non-uniform protocols you

2142
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:14,040
cannot negotiate between RTP over TLS

2143
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:18,000
and like let's say quick over TP using

2144
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,440
ice

2145
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,719
partially because you are sending media

2146
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:23,820
and you're sending data from a higher

2147
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:25,560
level protocol during the elimination so

2148
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,960
the candidates are changing

2149
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:30,000
and your protocol can rewind transport

2150
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,460
protocol is changing while you are

2151
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:35,639
sending media so it essentially means

2152
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:37,260
like figuring out the transition from

2153
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:40,380
RTP over click to RTP over TLS

2154
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:43,199
and or it's actually like switching

2155
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:46,560
between quick uh handshake and RTP over

2156
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,420
TLS handshake in the middle of the

2157
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:50,580
handshake and this is just

2158
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:55,139
like not something that it is possible

2159
01:33:55,139 --> 01:33:56,940
to do it's like it's designed to send

2160
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:59,340
the same kind of ending the same higher

2161
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,760
level product

2162
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:04,199
I look forward to continued discussions

2163
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:06,120
on the mailing list thank you Rama and

2164
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:09,239
thank you for raising the issue

2165
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:12,080
next slide

2166
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:16,620
so we were

2167
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:19,800
having a conversation about

2168
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,320
um what to do with quick congestion

2169
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,880
control and whether we need to be able

2170
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,860
to explicitly ask an implementation or

2171
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:29,699
do things uh and where we were at the

2172
01:34:29,699 --> 01:34:32,760
last interim meeting I guess was that uh

2173
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:37,260
I was proposing to explore whether uh

2174
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:40,860
with our RTP running over a quick uh it

2175
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:42,480
was a Frontline practice at the

2176
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,880
congestion control issues

2177
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,860
um now that we're recommending all right

2178
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:50,340
now that uh the draft will adopted has

2179
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:53,820
is registering in alpn we'll have a

2180
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:56,040
quick implementation of the other end

2181
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:59,159
we'll know this is something like rpt so

2182
01:34:59,159 --> 01:35:01,440
the proposal is that the sap should

2183
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,760
carry arpans because

2184
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,619
that'll last long years of multiple

2185
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:10,139
draft versions and experiments and

2186
01:35:10,139 --> 01:35:12,679
things like that

2187
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:16,800
and mix up next slide oh sorry Bernard

2188
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,699
please Jump Right In yeah um my my

2189
01:35:20,699 --> 01:35:22,520
concern would be you're now creating

2190
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:25,560
additional complexity

2191
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,340
um

2192
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,619
you know for example in in webrtc we

2193
01:35:28,619 --> 01:35:32,159
don't negotiate alpns within gtls right

2194
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,600
so

2195
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,340
um I would I would question why you need

2196
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:37,739
to do that at multiple places because

2197
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:40,380
you'll then oh I negotiated this alpm

2198
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:41,820
but I got another one you just have to

2199
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,380
check both of them so it just creates

2200
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,840
additional failure modes

2201
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,340
um

2202
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:49,260
so just somebody to think about whether

2203
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,360
whether in fact this this avoids

2204
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:55,639
failures or or it adds to the Brewers

2205
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:00,119
um I was thinking of this

2206
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:02,760
maybe not quite right but uh the way

2207
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:07,500
that quick uh variants were being

2208
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:10,920
uh advertised in aopm before version one

2209
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:13,739
was finalized is am I not getting that

2210
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:14,820
right

2211
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:17,280
related to something that let us make

2212
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,840
the sides go away I'm sorry let's shoot

2213
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,639
something up here

2214
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,800
yeah it had version there's also version

2215
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,900
negotiation which is different

2216
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:25,920
um

2217
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,659
yeah it's it's a complicated subject

2218
01:36:27,659 --> 01:36:28,920
because it did create a lot of

2219
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,600
brittleness because

2220
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:32,760
people would only advertise the last two

2221
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,380
versions and then sometimes if you got

2222
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:35,880
versions ahead you just wouldn't be able

2223
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,179
to connect

2224
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:42,420
right so I I think what you're talking

2225
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:46,920
about may be that I am uh getting a

2226
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:49,560
little bit ahead of wherever we need to

2227
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:54,840
be with this in the uh in the in the sdp

2228
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:58,760
address uh discussions

2229
01:36:59,719 --> 01:37:03,850
we'll talk some more on the mailing list

2230
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:05,040
[Music]

2231
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,560
you need more slides okay or this one oh

2232
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,780
yeah uh how did I ask for quick feedback

2233
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:12,300
is new uh we want to allow

2234
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,699
implementations to as quick for feedback

2235
01:37:14,699 --> 01:37:17,940
this is it in the draft

2236
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:21,119
um well yeah uh Moses and I saw I was I

2237
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:23,100
was um previously referencing the

2238
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:26,040
previous slide about alpns

2239
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,560
um I I don't uh

2240
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,260
I understand where the LPN purists are

2241
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:33,119
coming from that okay I just operate

2242
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:35,760
generic web servers and I have no idea

2243
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:38,460
people connecting to them blindly are

2244
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:40,980
going to get you know H3 or H2 or

2245
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,260
something else or or not even a HTTP

2246
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:44,760
service but something else

2247
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:46,500
I understand that aspect but I think

2248
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,060
this is very different because you're

2249
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,440
talking about

2250
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,560
a signaling exchange before where you

2251
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,900
know the parties know what what the

2252
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:57,780
service is it's not a blind uh client

2253
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,820
going to a port number

2254
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:02,639
um so I I don't think uh registering a

2255
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,159
bunch of alpns to describe very complex

2256
01:38:05,159 --> 01:38:09,179
sdps is useful a few months 20 different

2257
01:38:09,179 --> 01:38:11,159
things I don't think it's worth all the

2258
01:38:11,159 --> 01:38:15,179
permutations of alpns being registered

2259
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:18,900
um to to say that okay I made most these

2260
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:20,699
20 different things the sdp is being

2261
01:38:20,699 --> 01:38:21,840
explicit about

2262
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,840
what is being connected to yeah um so I

2263
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,340
don't think the LPN really provides any

2264
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,500
benefit whatsoever there

2265
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,520
yeah

2266
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,480
so uh make two observations there

2267
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:34,980
um one is

2268
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:38,699
um that what I'm talking about is

2269
01:38:38,699 --> 01:38:40,679
um if there are two different versions

2270
01:38:40,679 --> 01:38:44,159
of the uh RTP over quick uh

2271
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:46,920
specification that you support that you

2272
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,100
would have two different aopms for those

2273
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,719
but that you're not you know that you're

2274
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:53,699
not registering a bunch of alpns

2275
01:38:53,699 --> 01:38:57,540
depending on what the STP says what do

2276
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:59,580
you think that if you have different uh

2277
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,560
RTP over quick versions that you also

2278
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,119
have different STP for those Arts pure

2279
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:05,520
quick versions it seems like it seems

2280
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,080
unimaginable to me that Alpine is really

2281
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,580
the way to disambiguate all this stuff

2282
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:10,440
there's gonna be a boatload of STP way

2283
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:14,520
before you hit the alpn I believe you

2284
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,179
thank you

2285
01:39:17,179 --> 01:39:20,340
back to the next slide

2286
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:21,239
um

2287
01:39:21,239 --> 01:39:25,080
so basically uh now that we're want to

2288
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:29,159
allow optionally uh in the current draft

2289
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:30,139
um

2290
01:39:30,139 --> 01:39:33,119
substituting transport layer feedback

2291
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:36,060
for rtcp feedback for some

2292
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:40,800
um for some aspects of feedback and

2293
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,020
like I say recognizing that we are

2294
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,900
trying to reduce overhead where possible

2295
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:48,000
and that mapping may require some

2296
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,920
creativity

2297
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:50,639
um

2298
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,340
one of the proposals that's in the

2299
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:55,980
um the prep that the group has adopted

2300
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:57,500
is

2301
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:01,440
that Quirk does not have Knack but it

2302
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,780
can interpret you know it can detect

2303
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:06,719
lost packets so if it bounces that back

2304
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:09,900
up as a knack or an RTP implementation

2305
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:12,840
could know what to do with it

2306
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:16,739
um my question here is in order to do

2307
01:40:16,739 --> 01:40:17,940
this

2308
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:20,340
um do while we're talking about enabling

2309
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:24,780
transport layer feedback as a clump or

2310
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:26,880
are we naming individual pieces of

2311
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,980
Transport feedback there's a layer

2312
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:31,219
feedback that you want to get

2313
01:40:31,219 --> 01:40:34,619
my proposal was to

2314
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:37,940
um you know to request this as a clump

2315
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:41,040
but again this this is the first time

2316
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,080
I'm talking about this with the working

2317
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:46,020
group so that's almost certainly needs

2318
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,940
more working group discussion unless

2319
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:51,540
everybody uses just agree with me

2320
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:54,440
uh bro

2321
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:56,520
yeah I think we're going to need to

2322
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:59,580
discuss this in more detail because

2323
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:02,580
um along with I think the quick

2324
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:05,639
requirements for the transport because

2325
01:41:05,639 --> 01:41:07,440
um you're going to be negotiating you

2326
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,179
know just as transport parameters a

2327
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:10,500
whole bunch of quick extensions and

2328
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,139
things like that which may impact your

2329
01:41:13,139 --> 01:41:16,020
ability to do things and then on top of

2330
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:18,179
that you have the what I think of as the

2331
01:41:18,179 --> 01:41:20,280
RTP negotiation where you're saying What

2332
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:23,820
rtcp mechanisms you're using

2333
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,800
um so I I'd be a little bit concerned

2334
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,360
about the interaction between all that

2335
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,619
stuff

2336
01:41:28,619 --> 01:41:30,360
um and so I think we

2337
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:33,179
um uh you know as an example we should

2338
01:41:33,179 --> 01:41:34,920
be real clear about what we might not be

2339
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,900
doing like we might not we might be

2340
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:39,659
doing using quick acts but that might

2341
01:41:39,659 --> 01:41:41,760
require timing extensions and then if we

2342
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,679
have a whole bunch of stuff we might be

2343
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:46,139
able to not negotiate Max just as a

2344
01:41:46,139 --> 01:41:47,639
weird example

2345
01:41:47,639 --> 01:41:50,159
um so uh I think we need to dig into the

2346
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:51,900
transport requirements

2347
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:54,360
um and understand fully

2348
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:57,540
um what we're like what we need to get

2349
01:41:57,540 --> 01:41:59,520
rid of various things

2350
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,100
uh I would uh thank you Bernard I would

2351
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:06,060
agree and uh I would I would uh observe

2352
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:08,639
that a lot of the discussion that we've

2353
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:11,280
had has been assuming

2354
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:16,260
that thatagram was an option before that

2355
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:19,860
Graham was yeah I think that I think we

2356
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:21,600
started talking about this before data

2357
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,940
Graham was a working group draft and

2358
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:26,940
quick uh now that it's an RFC and

2359
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,460
quickest starting to do other extensions

2360
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:32,400
that might be relevant to us

2361
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,800
um that's probably a good thing for us

2362
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,080
to keep in mind as well

2363
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:39,540
thank you

2364
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:42,060
uh so I guess my question is are we is

2365
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:43,860
it do we want to try to

2366
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:45,840
Automall I guess you're first uh

2367
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,940
mozinary one on the previous topic uh

2368
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:50,280
for feedback uh one one thing to note

2369
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:52,020
from this morning's quick session uh

2370
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:54,960
this proposal for quick timestamps uh to

2371
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,940
be adopted I think it's very relevant

2372
01:42:56,940 --> 01:43:00,300
for RTP uh or media in general

2373
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:03,000
um so I think if people here want to

2374
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,239
support things like the rtcp feedback

2375
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:08,699
formats that do have time stamps and

2376
01:43:08,699 --> 01:43:10,080
they'd like to carry those over to quick

2377
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,119
I think I should chime in on the Quick

2378
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:14,580
List to say that you support that time

2379
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:16,139
stamp extension being added to quick

2380
01:43:16,139 --> 01:43:19,380
right uh Chris uh Christian equipment

2381
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:22,560
who is the author of The Ian quick was

2382
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,540
um asking if the working group was ready

2383
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:29,280
to uh adopt the time stamps draft and

2384
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,360
um

2385
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,580
the working group was kind of sort of

2386
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:35,219
maybe if I'm characterizing them

2387
01:43:35,219 --> 01:43:36,320
correctly

2388
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:40,940
and um but that um

2389
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:44,040
um I you know I did say you know ABT

2390
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,560
core is interested in this for some of

2391
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:50,040
the media uh real-time media congestion

2392
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:52,260
control mechanisms that use time stamps

2393
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:56,820
and uh it may be it may be correct that

2394
01:43:56,820 --> 01:44:01,920
uh amox the mock stuff goes the same way

2395
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,540
also Desiring to use timestamps so

2396
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:09,600
um yeah well Mary's point is well taken

2397
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:14,460
uh I think the chairs would be in a

2398
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:16,580
quick would be

2399
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:19,679
sympathetic to people expressing that

2400
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,679
you know views about this and saying uh

2401
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:25,800
some variation if we made this for media

2402
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:29,699
because we're using timestamps anyway

2403
01:44:29,699 --> 01:44:31,290
um

2404
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:32,520
[Music]

2405
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:34,860
so Spencer do you think are you asking

2406
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:36,360
for your draft to be adopted at this

2407
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,860
time or

2408
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:39,540
do you want to continue doing it as an

2409
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,159
individual

2410
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:44,400
um Michael so Michael

2411
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,820
now that we have our own working group

2412
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:50,540
draft for quick overst

2413
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:53,820
sdp of RTP over quick yeah how many how

2414
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:55,800
many times how many how many stacks are

2415
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,179
we talking about here

2416
01:44:57,179 --> 01:44:58,920
um but now that we have our own working

2417
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:01,260
group drafts my goal would be to try to

2418
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:04,560
keep my draft uh synchronized with the

2419
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,119
working group

2420
01:45:06,119 --> 01:45:08,520
political specification

2421
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,760
um like within a meeting cycle and

2422
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:16,100
um so I would like to get my draft

2423
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:20,880
coordinated with the working group draft

2424
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,699
new protocol specification

2425
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:26,760
um but the next time we have a ABD core

2426
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,860
meeting are we having an interim and

2427
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:32,280
whenever that is and uh as far as the

2428
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:34,260
working group to consider adoption at

2429
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:37,139
that point thank you all right thank you

2430
01:45:37,139 --> 01:45:41,880
okay uh v3c who's presenting Laurie good

2431
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:45,440
um I'm gonna be presenting so this is

2432
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:48,480
right yes I can hear you

2433
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,219
maybe a little louder

2434
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:52,880
if you can

2435
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:55,020
no

2436
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:57,119
yeah that's good

2437
01:45:57,119 --> 01:46:00,239
can someone confirm that yes we can hear

2438
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:03,138
you thank you yes

2439
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:07,100
can you hear us

2440
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,040
okay so um at least someone confirmed

2441
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,500
that they're hearing me so I'm going to

2442
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,480
be presenting the progress on the RTP

2443
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,880
pilot format for b3c

2444
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:21,000
next slide please

2445
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,940
so just as a brief background we bro

2446
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:26,760
first brought this topic to ADT core in

2447
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:28,800
a virtual meeting in February this year

2448
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,980
and since then we've been receiving some

2449
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:35,580
amount of feedback not much

2450
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:36,360
um

2451
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:39,960
and just as a quick refresher so this

2452
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,420
v3c

2453
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:44,880
encoding is like intending to reuse

2454
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,860
existing 2D video coding Technologies

2455
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:49,920
and compress a volumetric video using

2456
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,679
that and it is in fact designed to be

2457
01:46:52,679 --> 01:46:54,480
video code recognostic so you can use

2458
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:58,020
pretty much any video Codec available

2459
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:02,100
so what it does is it decomposes a 3D

2460
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:04,020
volumetric heater frame into beta

2461
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:08,100
component components and Atlas component

2462
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,900
the atlas component being mostly

2463
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:12,179
metadata which describes how the video

2464
01:47:12,179 --> 01:47:14,940
components can be reprojected back into

2465
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:18,540
the video back into the 3D space

2466
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:21,000
the compression of this atlasm metadata

2467
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,500
is defined in this ISO standard and its

2468
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,600
high level syntax or syntax rather is

2469
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,540
represented as null units that are very

2470
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:33,960
similar to hevc or BBC all the units

2471
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:36,600
next slide please

2472
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:41,060
so the way we proposed and planned to

2473
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:44,639
develop this v3crtp payload format is

2474
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:47,340
therefore also aligned with the beta

2475
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:49,980
coding specifications so the video

2476
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:51,780
components can be streamed according to

2477
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:53,900
the respective RTD pellets

2478
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:56,820
specifications again you can pretty much

2479
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:58,860
use whatever video Codec you want to use

2480
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:01,860
and then choose the corresponding RFC

2481
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:04,139
for the payload format

2482
01:48:04,139 --> 01:48:07,500
the issue is that there currently is no

2483
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:10,619
rtb payload format for this Atlas data

2484
01:48:10,619 --> 01:48:13,020
which is the metadata that describes the

2485
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:14,520
reproduction

2486
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:17,460
of this video components into the back

2487
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:20,239
into the 3D frame

2488
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:23,400
and therefore we were proposing to

2489
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:26,820
Define an encapsulation uh for this

2490
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:30,840
Atlas null units uh into RTP packets

2491
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:34,860
along with that we propose some b3c

2492
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,719
specific specific payload format

2493
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:39,239
parameters which operate just the same

2494
01:48:39,239 --> 01:48:41,520
way as video coding payload from Target

2495
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,100
parameters too

2496
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,900
uh then in addition there's a new

2497
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:48,119
grouping type that we're proposing which

2498
01:48:48,119 --> 01:48:49,980
allows you to group multiple beta

2499
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:52,560
components streams and Atlas streams uh

2500
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:55,800
together to indicate that these streams

2501
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:58,080
media streams should be consumed uh

2502
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,360
together

2503
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:02,820
and lastly there's this reference to

2504
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:05,340
bundling

2505
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:09,420
which is using this RFC 8843 which

2506
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:11,880
essentially allows you to bundle these

2507
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,219
multiple streams into a single session

2508
01:49:14,219 --> 01:49:16,139
or single stream

2509
01:49:16,139 --> 01:49:19,340
next slide please

2510
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:22,260
so since the first since we first

2511
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:24,179
introduced the topic we've received some

2512
01:49:24,179 --> 01:49:26,280
amount of feedback so the first feedback

2513
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:29,159
was from the meeting and based on that

2514
01:49:29,159 --> 01:49:32,099
we refined the payload format so we

2515
01:49:32,099 --> 01:49:34,080
removed a lot of the

2516
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:37,679
uh stuff that was inherited from hevc

2517
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:40,380
RDP pellet format and then for example

2518
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,000
dropped the multi-time application

2519
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,880
package and refined the payload format

2520
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,580
parameters section and so on so

2521
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:50,340
essentially just cleaned it up a bit

2522
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:52,980
and after that we've only received a

2523
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:54,139
couple of

2524
01:49:54,139 --> 01:49:56,820
minor improvements just suggestions

2525
01:49:56,820 --> 01:50:00,560
mostly focusing on edit editorial stuff

2526
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,599
and uh just as a reminder so we're

2527
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:05,940
managing this feedback on this uh behind

2528
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:10,619
this GitHub link next slide please

2529
01:50:10,619 --> 01:50:12,260
so

2530
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:16,739
in order to solicit more feedback and

2531
01:50:16,739 --> 01:50:19,199
continue the progress the draft uh we

2532
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,840
would like to propose a working group

2533
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:25,400
adoption at this point

2534
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,900
um

2535
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:30,960
I hope that is something that we can all

2536
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,060
agree to

2537
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:38,719
and yeah now any questions or comments

2538
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:46,080
anybody

2539
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:49,340
um Stefan

2540
01:50:49,619 --> 01:50:52,020
so this isn't within this voice I can

2541
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,460
understand within the scope of the

2542
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:55,800
working group so and it's specifically

2543
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,659
mature so I have no problems in adopting

2544
01:50:57,659 --> 01:51:00,659
it uh one other thing and that is

2545
01:51:00,659 --> 01:51:01,260
um

2546
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:03,080
uh

2547
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:06,540
Lori you will soon run into the same

2548
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,159
issue with your green metadata people

2549
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:12,179
ran into uh a few weeks ago and that is

2550
01:51:12,179 --> 01:51:14,880
the public availability of iso documents

2551
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,380
for free

2552
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:19,260
um and I cannot hold my service there

2553
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:21,599
again uh to um

2554
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:27,390
uh distribute that you uh you um

2555
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:30,000
[Music]

2556
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,300
Point Cloud people sent me a late

2557
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:36,900
pre-ballot uh draft or pointer to it on

2558
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:39,360
the MPX site and end document a November

2559
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:40,440
document

2560
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:43,800
and uh people who want to review this

2561
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:46,320
ISO document deciser standard can

2562
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,540
contact me privately and I will forward

2563
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:50,520
it to those people thank you thank you

2564
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:51,900
Stefan

2565
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:54,599
all right so um yeah I think it sounds

2566
01:51:54,599 --> 01:51:57,239
like certainly is in scope so I suspect

2567
01:51:57,239 --> 01:51:58,560
I think what we should do is we should

2568
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,060
do a call for adoption on the mailing

2569
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:01,260
list

2570
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:03,000
um this will give you a chance to

2571
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,760
also um you know the community that's

2572
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,560
interested in this can express their

2573
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:09,060
interests but it's certainly in scope so

2574
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:10,440
I think

2575
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:13,260
um we'll do a call for adoption

2576
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:17,000
unless you disagree burner but I think

2577
01:52:17,099 --> 01:52:19,500
I think we need to move on to the next

2578
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,659
uh because we do yeah we're covered

2579
01:52:21,659 --> 01:52:24,360
tight on time all right so yeah finally

2580
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:27,259
um green metadata

2581
01:52:28,679 --> 01:52:31,440
sorry for you know giving making you a

2582
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:32,699
little tight on time here but let's all

2583
01:52:32,699 --> 01:52:36,000
right I'd like to be on time and it's

2584
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,639
about uh rdcp messages from Green

2585
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:41,099
million in the next slide please

2586
01:52:41,099 --> 01:52:43,500
so this is about uh the Epic

2587
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,780
specifications can you move closer to

2588
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:48,000
the mic so yeah try to be right on

2589
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,280
access all right yeah uh I hope this

2590
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:52,380
works better now

2591
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:53,460
oh yeah

2592
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:56,159
so this is about uh the iso

2593
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:58,159
specification

2594
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:02,040
23001-11 which is an Egyptian uh media

2595
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,500
consumption so this is talking about how

2596
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:06,659
encoding and decoding can be done in a

2597
01:53:06,659 --> 01:53:09,300
more energy efficient fashion

2598
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:12,840
so this specification provides two sets

2599
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:15,900
of metadata one is this video encoder

2600
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:18,840
generated uh which is complexity

2601
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:21,840
information being sent to the decoder so

2602
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:24,119
that it can uh you know adapt its

2603
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:26,760
decoding but this these sets of matter

2604
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:30,060
that I sent via supplemented SEI uh

2605
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:31,560
within the video stream so this is not

2606
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,800
the focus of the draft here the focus of

2607
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:36,780
this draft is a second set of metadata

2608
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:39,239
which is the decoder feedback uh

2609
01:53:39,239 --> 01:53:42,360
messages so uh to decode to send some

2610
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,040
feedback and encoder trials without

2611
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,980
accordingly uh the energy collection uh

2612
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:49,560
at the decoding end so we needed a

2613
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,659
format for that those messages because

2614
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:54,480
there is no rtcp format defined for this

2615
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,400
and this is the format that is being

2616
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:59,159
specified outlined by this draft and the

2617
01:53:59,159 --> 01:54:01,199
current version is linked here

2618
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:04,619
uh this stock is providing two uh new

2619
01:54:04,619 --> 01:54:06,840
rtcp messages one is to post push a

2620
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,219
resolution request and the other one is

2621
01:54:08,219 --> 01:54:11,520
the feedback message uh from the encoder

2622
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,800
which is a to post special uh resolution

2623
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:17,159
notification next slide please

2624
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:20,580
so uh the new messages are specified in

2625
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:23,159
a similar fashion to uh the payload

2626
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:26,940
specific feedback messages uh which are

2627
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:31,260
defined in avpf so uh as mentioned the

2628
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:34,020
two new messages uh they are they can be

2629
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:36,599
sent as a full compound rdcp packet or

2630
01:54:36,599 --> 01:54:39,599
an early rtcp packet the reason being is

2631
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:41,159
that these messages are not very time

2632
01:54:41,159 --> 01:54:44,940
critical so you can send them as early

2633
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:47,280
rtpcp messages if the application so

2634
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,460
reads but this is not required

2635
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:53,280
um and then the main idea is that the

2636
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,719
first message on the top this is what

2637
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:56,520
the decoder sends towards encoder when

2638
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,440
it wants the encoded to adapt the energy

2639
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:02,639
uh uh the uh the the decoder industry

2640
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:05,340
consumption and this is done via this

2641
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:07,920
typical message format ssrc is equals

2642
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,659
number and then obviously these are the

2643
01:55:09,659 --> 01:55:11,300
key elements here frame rate picture

2644
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,320
height which is the request that the

2645
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:15,840
decoder is sending okay please adopt to

2646
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:19,199
this new resume function or frame rate

2647
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:24,000
and then as these messages go there is a

2648
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,800
feedback message from the encoder back

2649
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:27,780
to the decoder it has similar

2650
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:30,599
information Fields here uh but the

2651
01:55:30,599 --> 01:55:33,360
reason of these uh information Fields is

2652
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:35,400
that the encoder might be trying to

2653
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,860
adopt from multiple decoders so it might

2654
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:39,780
have a different decision to do so it

2655
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:41,699
informs the decoder hey this is what I

2656
01:55:41,699 --> 01:55:44,159
thought I've done with your request so

2657
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:46,800
next slide please

2658
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:49,380
some comments about timing and security

2659
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:52,500
so as mentioned before the encoder might

2660
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,300
be catering for multiple decoders so if

2661
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:55,679
there are multiple messages coming in

2662
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:57,719
then the encoder needs to decide you

2663
01:55:57,719 --> 01:56:00,480
know joint need of optimization so one

2664
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:02,340
decoder saying that another one saying

2665
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:04,199
that so then code has to make a decision

2666
01:56:04,199 --> 01:56:06,239
as mentioned before advances are not

2667
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:07,500
time critical

2668
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:08,159
um

2669
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:11,400
so their Center is a regular rtcp timing

2670
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:13,560
some security considerations have been

2671
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:16,320
documented in this draft which is

2672
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:19,020
um if the message is approved or uh

2673
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:20,880
there's a malicious message it might the

2674
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,920
decoder might request the maliciousness

2675
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:24,719
message might request a extremely low

2676
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:27,719
value quality or I mean we just recently

2677
01:56:27,719 --> 01:56:29,340
got thinking uh it could be a request

2678
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:31,139
for extremely high video quality that

2679
01:56:31,139 --> 01:56:34,199
the whole decoding can install so um yes

2680
01:56:34,199 --> 01:56:36,420
some integrated Integrity production

2681
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:38,460
authentication is required that can be

2682
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:40,739
done in a very simple fashion to avpf as

2683
01:56:40,739 --> 01:56:44,219
using srtp or as a vpf

2684
01:56:44,219 --> 01:56:46,139
next slide please

2685
01:56:46,139 --> 01:56:48,780
yeah so that's the last slide that I

2686
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:50,520
have so that's the purpose to gather

2687
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,679
feedback we already have some feedback

2688
01:56:52,679 --> 01:56:54,780
comments from Jonathan that we mostly

2689
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:56,099
acknowledge and we are already working

2690
01:56:56,099 --> 01:57:00,480
on the draft to uh to implement that uh

2691
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,699
the the target is to have no reflected

2692
01:57:02,699 --> 01:57:04,800
discussion and then incorporate this

2693
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,780
feedback and eventually when the time

2694
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:09,960
comes uh seek for an adoption yes sure

2695
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:13,199
George here's your code I have one quick

2696
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:14,460
question

2697
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:16,739
um RTC pick rtcp messages aren't

2698
01:57:16,739 --> 01:57:19,199
reliable so are you are you sending this

2699
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:20,940
as kind of soft state that you keep

2700
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:23,400
repeating what you expect continuously

2701
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:25,679
since he has transaction right the

2702
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:27,900
receiver sends something the decoder

2703
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:30,540
sends a wish to the encoder the encoder

2704
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:32,460
at some point would respond how does the

2705
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:34,520
decoder know that the encoder ever got

2706
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:37,560
what it was sending so since there is no

2707
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:40,380
acknowledgment in rtcp

2708
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:42,360
um do you repeat this on a constant

2709
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:44,760
basis until things get better or I

2710
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:46,800
didn't find anything in the draft when I

2711
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:49,920
was quickly grabbing through it so but I

2712
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,020
might have missed stuff yeah so these

2713
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:53,699
messages are working in a very similar

2714
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:56,820
way as uh the typical special trade-off

2715
01:57:56,820 --> 01:58:00,060
request message in avpf almost identical

2716
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:02,040
fashion so the decoder sends a message

2717
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:03,780
with the specific sequence member the

2718
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:05,460
encoder is supposed to reply to that

2719
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:08,460
sequence number so uh that's how the

2720
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:10,440
decoder finds out uh that for a given

2721
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:13,260
ssrc for a specific sequence number it

2722
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:15,239
got the message the The Encore got the

2723
01:58:15,239 --> 01:58:16,980
message

2724
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:18,719
all right

2725
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:20,400
yeah like some questions as an

2726
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,199
individual first uh thanks to Stefan

2727
01:58:22,199 --> 01:58:25,320
when he sent me the the um ISO document

2728
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:27,119
um I see that there's actually four

2729
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:29,040
different feedback mechanisms in that

2730
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,080
document that you're only doing one at

2731
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,000
this point is that all you're intending

2732
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,139
to do or is this just your starting

2733
01:58:34,139 --> 01:58:36,060
point and you're planning to do some of

2734
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:37,860
the others as well yeah I think we

2735
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:39,719
picked the most important thing that we

2736
01:58:39,719 --> 01:58:41,760
found at this point in time it could be

2737
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:43,980
uh based on feedback if I think there

2738
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:46,139
are more messages okay I mean if that's

2739
01:58:46,139 --> 01:58:47,400
I mean if you think this is the one

2740
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:48,840
that's the most important that seems

2741
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,639
reasonable I just wanted to see if what

2742
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:53,219
your plans were going forward and then

2743
01:58:53,219 --> 01:58:56,340
um the other is I there are

2744
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:59,280
some mechanisms I'm not sure I I seem to

2745
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,380
recall at the sdp level to specify

2746
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:05,280
things like frame rate and resolution

2747
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,679
to negotiate that at the signaling level

2748
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:10,260
and I want to know

2749
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:11,940
um is this

2750
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:14,760
to what extent is this complementary to

2751
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:16,980
that versus overlapping it

2752
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:19,199
I I would think this is complementary so

2753
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:21,480
STP is then how you're setting up the

2754
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:23,400
session then this is more I think this

2755
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:25,199
can work together with it so then the

2756
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:26,820
decoder is sending some messages so yeah

2757
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:29,099
and the third question I just had us is

2758
01:59:29,099 --> 01:59:32,400
there um any IPR on this that needs to

2759
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:35,219
be disclosed we yeah so Qualcomm made a

2760
01:59:35,219 --> 01:59:36,560
IPS statement

2761
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,060
I didn't see it so we should I'll check

2762
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:40,080
that out okay

2763
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:41,820
okay thank you

2764
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:45,179
yeah okay and if that um yeah so you're

2765
01:59:45,179 --> 01:59:46,560
not you're not asking for adoption yet

2766
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:48,420
you want to do some more provisions and

2767
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:49,500
then

2768
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:51,599
yes the idea is getting more feedback

2769
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:53,580
and yeah eventually we would like to

2770
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:56,219
seek adoption but I mean when we crossed

2771
01:59:56,219 --> 01:59:58,320
that bridge okay thank you all right

2772
01:59:58,320 --> 01:59:59,940
great well I think that

2773
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:02,280
then wraps us up unless anybody has any

2774
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:04,980
other business in the one minute we have

2775
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:06,119
left

2776
02:00:06,119 --> 02:00:08,400
otherwise thank you all

2777
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,300
um

2778
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:11,639
we'll discuss whether we need an interim

2779
02:00:11,639 --> 02:00:13,080
we've been doing interims fairly

2780
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:16,020
successfully lately but once per cycle

2781
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:18,360
so we may do that again

2782
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:19,440
um depending on how things are

2783
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,480
progressing otherwise we'll see you all

2784
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:24,799
on Monday thank you all very much

2785
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:26,460
Bernard thank you

2786
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:29,900
thank you see you
