bad for him so

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
we agreed that he'll listen to it

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,720
afterwards but he was very uh much

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,880
active in the preparation of uh the

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,840

happy to continue this work

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
um area director nothing new um so

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,000
we're always abusing the um

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
minutes

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,400
notes page also for the agenda of the

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,320
items after the

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,799
chair slides so uh go there and help

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,560
with the notes and and see the agenda

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,840
and all the urls for it

35
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
there is no physical blue sheet but i

36
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,880
would

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,680
really ask everybody in the room to

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
get onto meat echo either on the phone

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,720
or the notebook and join the session

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,079
because otherwise you will not be

41
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,479
counted and then maybe we will not have

42
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,640
100 seats free but i mean they're

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
they're doing planning for for the size

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,759
of the working groups and also you may

45
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,079
want to show up in the proceedings as

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,759
having attended certain working groups

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,280
they will not happen by just sitting

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,679
there not doing anything

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,440
and we don't have any official jabber

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
scribe but that's just the chat so

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
hopefully enough people in the room can

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
help out with questions when people on

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,080
the on the remote side are

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,680
confused about what's going on in the

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,120
room but otherwise just come to the

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,360
microphone

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,640
okay we're applying early ipr disclosure

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,720
um process in this working group which

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,599
means that um

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
the latest when we're asking for ipr

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,920
disclosures is when we're adopting uh

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,400
works for the working group you're also

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
happy to do ipr disclosures for any

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,319
individual submissions you're doing i'm

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,400
i'm typically doing that for mine

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
um and so we don't want to run into the

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,879
issue of doing the ipr disclosure

68
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,959
question only when stuff is being moved

69
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,519
into the isg at the very tail end

70
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,760
so we now have nine rfcs and so

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,879
they're implementers of anima protocol

72
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,200
specs so be sure that you are aware of

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,280
the errata that we have or even better

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,239
so you discover new erratas and then you

75
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,080
can use that process

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,239
to make others aware of if anything

77
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,720
we've specified isn't working out as it

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,480
should um and

79
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,000
there is the url here and if you have

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,920
any questions write ask on the mailing

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,040
list

82
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,159
or

83
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,879
just the chairs

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,120
all right where are we so the new rfc is

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,239
uh was a draft ietf enema asa guidelines

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,360
that or was in rfc editor queue

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,440
at itf-113 so it passed through and yeah

88
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
we've got a new rfc

89
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,480
congratulations to the i think also all

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,879
sleeping authors uh

91
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,519
being in the pacific sorry

92
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,040
in the um

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
asian time zones new zealand and so on

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,560
uh brian and others

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
right we have three working group drafts

96
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,439
without slot ass so those are the ones

97
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,080
that i would like to maybe get quick

98
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,400
statements for the notes here

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,959
don't think how i can share that quickly

100
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,000
but

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,238
let's say we've got the brewski cloud is

102
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,399
there any you know quick thing to put in

103
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,039
the note for it

104
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,199
uh michael richardson so i guess i'm

105
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
responsible for all three of those

106
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,440
um risky cloud isn't the same state it

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,560
was in 113 which is we we're we'd like a

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,400
working group last call

109
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,160
um we haven't changed anything um it has

110
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,800
a we'll have a normative reference on a

111
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
lamp's document that is not yet adopted

112
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
but that's not our problem

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
um

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,440
so voucher delegation still a lot of

115
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,759
interest in it

116
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,800
there is some work outside the ietf

117
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
doing something similar

118
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,440
and um

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
we should do what they did

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,880
um that may somewhat require us to wait

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,240
for them to publicly publish

122
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,280
but

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,759
other than that it's basically it it is

124
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,240
it needs attention okay

125
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
uh 8366 bis i did provide some a slide

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,479
which we might get to at the end

127
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,479
um and there are working group decisions

128
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,919
that need to be made about what to do

129
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,440
with it exactly

130
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,320
um

131
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,919
whether it goes to internet standard or

132
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,759
not is the question

133
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,400
that's it from me

134
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
okay so i've taken as a working item for

135
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
myself to do the review and the

136
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,160
working group last call for

137
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,560
the brewski cloud and the other two or

138
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,960
so maybe let's ping in in two months or

139
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
so to see how we can take up steam on

140
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,560
them because i think there's a lot of

141
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
other items that we do have slots which

142
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,240
are more important just wanted to track

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,960
it

144
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,560
with the working group chair slides all

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
right so these others will have slots

146
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,280
for

147
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,759
so what's on the tail end um yeah so

148
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,360
this is my long reminder which i'm not

149
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
going to read in detail but please

150
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,960
you know especially if you're a

151
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,759
co-author of any of the drafts uh please

152
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,160
you know figure out which other drafts

153
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
you want to do reviews for and

154
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,800
you know swap the

155
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
token buckets back and forth so that we

156
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,240
get more reviews

157
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,639
in the working group because i think nmr

158
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,560
is one of the many working groups where

159
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,479
the isg is rightfully complaining of

160
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,120
having to do more work than it should uh

161
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
do

162
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,080
all right and one particular um you know

163
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,960
uh nice way to do it is to

164
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,840
become a shepherd for for a document

165
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,520
which doesn't only mean a review but

166
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
also some interesting

167
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
itf process that the help that the

168
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,160
chairs will happily help you with um you

169
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,039
know preparing a working group you know

170
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,639
a shepherd document and so on so that's

171
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,000
a nice way to learn a little bit of the

172
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,560
bureaucracy of the itf if you ever want

173
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,479
to become something like a secretary or

174
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,840
working group chair or something like

175
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,758
that that's the smallest step to take

176
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,599
okay and um yeah so this uh

177
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,120
these these working group meetings end

178
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
up being a lot procedural kind of

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,360
remembering what you know

180
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
marks to do which next steps to do in

181
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
the process and

182
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,319
maybe not enough time for technical

183
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,280
discussion and um so that just means

184
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,199
you're not asking enough to have forums

185
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,479
for technical discussions when we're

186
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,319
running out of time doing it three times

187
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,560
a year in these meetings um so if you

188
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,720
have that feeling for for your document

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
please come to us chairs and and we'll

190
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,319
we'll talk with you how to improve on

191
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
that and uh most of the you know active

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
work in the animal working group was

193
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,879
started by contributors just organizing

194
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,800
themselves and that's actually the

195
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,720
brewski design team

196
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,680
which

197
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,319
is now meeting weekly from 11 to 12

198
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,319
eastern standard time

199
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,120
url is is here and that's pretty much

200
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,560
doing most of uh you know the

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,160
coordinating work for the brewski

202
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,240
documents and i'm also trying to smuggle

203
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,720
some acp stuff into it when uh there is

204
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,199
time for it but obviously um if we have

205
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,080
contributors of of other work um that

206
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,599
that would like to have a separate

207
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,400
meeting

208
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,919
perfectly happy to set that up

209
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
i'm tooling reminders so pretty much all

210
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,879
of the anima

211
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,280
individual submission and working group

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,520
drafts are on the inofficial anima

213
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,440
working group github mailing list that

214
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,080
allows us very easily to you know have

215
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,479
every individual submission go into it

216
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,000
and not bother with you know any

217
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,839
constraints that the official

218
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,240
github procedures would otherwise put on

219
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,559
us and i think that's been very helpful

220
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,240
and successful over the past few years

221
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,440
right and that brings me actually to the

222
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
end of the official share slides any

223
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,160
questions suggestions

224
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,040
any

225
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,839
agenda bashing

226
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,680
going once

227
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,959
going twice

228
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,320
all right

229
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,440
so

230
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,240
i'm looking now at the notes page and

231
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,640
next thing up is um

232
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,320
number one would be stefan

233
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,560
you can step to the microphone and uh

234
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
do you find the slides yourself should i

235
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,959
uh bring them up for you

236
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,399
oh i just

237
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
requested

238
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
yeah i requested the preloaded one so

239
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,959
okay that

240
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
okay i'm still

241
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,519
okay

242
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,000
just a second

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
i'm still seeing your slides

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,180
in another jws voucher

245
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,600
[Music]

246
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,000
there we go

247
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
is that now

248
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,680
no

249
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
okay

250
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,160
okay i'm not sure what's what's

251
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,800
happening here

252
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,959
um sorry

253
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
oh okay yeah

254
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,519
so i'm trying i'm not sure what my

255
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,360
problem is with uh getting the meeting

256
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,000
materials

257
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,360
uh i think you somehow shared uh so i

258
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,959
could skip to your slides now

259
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,320
that's interesting

260
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,839
you need to stop sharing your own slides

261
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,760
and then stefan can select

262
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,399
the ones he wants to share

263
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,640
okay

264
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,200
so for whatever reason the video is not

265
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
working i still get an error message

266
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,320
that the video is not working

267
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,160
so you should see the first slide of

268
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,040
update on jws signed vouchers okay

269
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
perfect

270
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
so i'm still trying to switch on the

271
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
video because it's always nice to have

272
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,240
some face to the

273
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,720
slides oh it's there it's working

274
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
perfect

275
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,640
so i would like to give an update on

276
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,240
jws science vouchers so that is

277
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
describing a draft describing jws signed

278
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,240
voucher artifacts for bootstrapping

279
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,200
protocols and this is a draft from

280
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,880
michael richardson and thomas verna and

281
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,200
thomas asked me to to do him a favor

282
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,959
because he's on vacation so greetings

283
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,000
from him

284
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,519
and

285
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
i would like to give an overview about

286
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,360
that one

287
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,320
so just to have a short recap

288
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
on what is contained in jws voucher so

289
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,920
the motivation to come up with jws

290
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,519
voucher stems from rfc 8366 because it

291
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,720
specifies

292
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,000
cms signed json for voucher artifacts

293
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,480
and this draft and contrast

294
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,000
proposes to utilize jw assigned json as

295
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,560
a further option to that the draft

296
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
basically changes the encoding but it

297
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,480
makes no changes to the young that is

298
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,760
defined in 8366

299
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,000
so the format itself can be used by

300
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,120
brewski

301
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,839
as defined in

302
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,720
8995 and also brewski

303
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
prm prime

304
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,120
which we heard year afterwards

305
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399
relies on the jws form factor so that is

306
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,880
basically uh the form factor that that

307
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,360
we completely rely on in both key prime

308
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,160
so

309
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,560
also the jwf options that have been

310
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,200
discussed uh in the past was were

311
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,000
related to the serialization

312
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and are in jws voucher

313
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,040
now the

314
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,160
the serialization was fixed to general

315
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,519
uh jws jason z realization and there was

316
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,000
a switch from compact serialization and

317
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
the reasoning for that was

318
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,440
to have more possibilities and also cope

319
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,519
with or also

320
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,480
be as flexible as other formats that are

321
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,959
currently used for the voucher so for

322
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:17,920
instance

323
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,079
multiple signatures are only possible

324
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,360
when we use the generalized jws json

325
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,519
serialization that wasn't possible with

326
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,399
a simple or with a compact serialization

327
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,560
so multiple signatures are already

328
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,959
supported by json and cms as used in

329
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,720
8366

330
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,519
also the constrained voucher draft uses

331
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,040
sibo and kosa

332
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,399
which also

333
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,959
enables the provisioning of multiple

334
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,560
signatures of

335
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,199
vouchers

336
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,839
so that was one of the driving factors

337
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,240
to come up with vouchers in jws

338
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,040
so how does that all look like

339
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
so the switch from the

340
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,360
compact serialization to the

341
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,160
uh

342
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,199
general

343
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,279
json serialization looks like the one on

344
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,639
the left-hand side so we have the

345
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,240
payload which contains the voucher and

346
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,160
just below that we have the signatures

347
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,959
and here in the example we have just one

348
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,240
signature and uh that is a protected

349
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
part here with the x5c

350
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,839
and then the algorithm that is used here

351
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,079
is elliptic curve

352
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,680
based signing

353
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,560
utilizing sec p

354
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,240
256 r1

355
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,360
and what was included in the version of

356
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,920
4 was this type here

357
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,800
to allow for characterizing which type

358
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,959
the whole payload is over here

359
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,760
on the wire uh that looks like here on

360
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
the right hand side so this is uh that

361
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,279
is that would be the voucher response

362
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,519
here

363
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,399
so that would uh the view

364
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,680
that you see on the wire

365
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,000
so those were the the main changes since

366
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,760
the last ietf meeting

367
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,399
so just to recap the changes here we

368
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,240
didn't know there was an update of

369
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,880
chapter one the introduction

370
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,199
and there was some rework of chapter

371
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,519
three regarding the voucher artifact was

372
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,399
a json web signature uh based on the

373
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,079
fact that we switched the

374
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,040
serialization type

375
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,920
and

376
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,160
in the last version of four this

377
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,399
optional header parameter for the type

378
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
has been added

379
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
and that is being reflected also in the

380
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
different examples in the draft itself

381
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,079
so that is for the pledge voucher

382
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,880
request register voter request and the

383
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,680
voter itself

384
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,880
so the next thing is uh finalizing the

385
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,519
the draft itself then there is some

386
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,959
further alignment on going in the

387
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,639
burstly design team called uh that

388
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,800
tallest was referring to

389
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
and the outcome as usual will be

390
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
circulated on the mailing list for

391
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,079
further discussion

392
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,000
so um

393
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,240
here there's also some interest and

394
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,399
interop testing with others

395
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,240
so that would could be for instance in

396
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,920
the in the context of bluesky prm

397
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,399
which i will report about afterwards uh

398
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
because for bowski prm also the

399
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,160
prototype implementation or the proof of

400
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,639
conflict implementation is

401
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,880
has been finished and we would be happy

402
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,440
to to do interrupt testing

403
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,759
with both so jws voucher and

404
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,279
specifically also with postgre prm

405
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,720
and working group review is appreciated

406
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,600
in the same way as tallest also pointed

407
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
to the fact that for certain drafts

408
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,839
shepherds are still being looked for

409
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,720
and

410
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,880
also for the jws voucher we're looking

411
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,399
for a shepherd

412
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,880
so if there is interest

413
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,120
please

414
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
come back to us or raise your hands to

415
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
become a chocolate of that document

416
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,360
any question

417
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,760
thank you very much um

418
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,679
so i already put in the notes kind of

419
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,079
the the two process recommendations

420
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,119
right um

421
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,199
so the uh the changelog would be good to

422
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,359
capture the names of you know the people

423
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
that you know caused the improvements of

424
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,880
the document to be made whether it's

425
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,559
official review or just in the design

426
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,640
team meetings or so that that helps us a

427
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
lot when we progress the document so

428
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
that we know how many

429
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,760
eyes were laid on the document and then

430
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,919
also when you mentioned interop and so

431
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,640
on that that can also be put into a to

432
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,880
be removed section but

433
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,840
any information of actual implementation

434
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
or interrupt or so are always very good

435
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,960
input for ietf and iesg review later on

436
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
even if it will obviously be removed

437
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,440
from the document and

438
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
would have to come into its own you know

439
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,360
deployment experience document later on

440
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,880
but

441
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
no reason not to not to write it and

442
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,240
that's not specific to this document

443
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,280
that i think

444
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,000
is for all the documents um getting

445
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,160
towards the you know the end of the

446
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
working group

447
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,679
life cycle last call and then further

448
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,520
further into it these these two pieces

449
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
are very helpful for the process so

450
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
sorry no actual technical input right

451
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
now

452
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,760
no but but that's very good i mean uh we

453
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
have that since the last itf meeting

454
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
that we have proof of concept

455
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,919
implementations available for several of

456
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,080
the drafts and i actually wasn't aware

457
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,760
that it would be helpful to put that

458
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,640
into the drafts but uh i will take that

459
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,120
uh for jws voucher and also for the for

460
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,160
the further ski discussions okay thanks

461
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,720
i mean we'll come up by i am by the good

462
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
you know ietf reviewers in in idea

463
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,600
review or typically then the director of

464
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,320
members isg review and so on so it's

465
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
it's it's easier not to to do it you

466
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,720
know on demand but do it up front when

467
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,679
you already have the answers

468
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,480
okay

469
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,919
perfect

470
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,480
thank you

471
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,919
later so the next speaker would then be

472
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,280
you as well you can right so i can just

473
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,600
share the other slide set

474
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,840
so this is a longer list of answers here

475
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,160
uh so that's the update on risky with

476
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,679
pledge in responder mode or short

477
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,400
brewski prime

478
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
i

479
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,440
provided a link here to the url that we

480
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,200
have on github or the draft so um

481
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
authors of the drafts are michael

482
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
richardson elliot leo thomas vanna

483
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,720
myself

484
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,400
so we we had uh

485
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,799
two two versions that were provided to

486
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,840
the ietf in the since itf-113

487
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,799
so

488
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,559
regarding the main changes from version

489
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,320
2 to version 3 there are mostly

490
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,960
editorial improvements so we we got some

491
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,880
review comments up front and we got some

492
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,600
discussion during the last ietf meeting

493
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,120
that led to the

494
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,080
update of examples uh to be more

495
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,799
specific regarding the x5c occurrences

496
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,960
so we had some some gibberish printed in

497
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,600
there but now it's all called base64

498
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,799
encoded value uh equal equal

499
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,240
so that was a line throughout the

500
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
document and

501
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,679
as requested we all also included

502
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,480
a graphic into the document but then

503
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,240
lately took it out of the document and

504
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,960
just provided a link to the document to

505
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,640
not

506
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,480
have different versions of the text and

507
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,919
the pdf file there or the html file

508
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,400
uh what was also done to to really

509
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,799
improve readability was restructuring of

510
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,080
section five

511
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,640
uh that was the leftover from

512
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,120
where woosky ae and brewski prm were

513
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,520
both connected in one draft

514
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,400
so we resolved that

515
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,799
the the structural issue that we had

516
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,320
here in section 5 and basically

517
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,640
flattened the hierarchy here

518
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,320
we also did some enhancement of

519
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,000
requirements and motivation in the

520
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
section four to have a better motivation

521
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,360
for here and as such

522
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,559
then uh the main changes from version

523
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,960
three to version four were based on the

524
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,240
peer review that was being done by esco

525
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,799
so thanks a lot esko on that place here

526
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
for the for the in-depth review by the

527
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,320
way besides putting

528
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,200
putting

529
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,039
reviewers on the acknowledgement i also

530
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,799
learned that it is possible to put them

531
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,480
as contributors

532
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
into the document itself

533
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,760
so

534
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,240
they appear then at least in the xml

535
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,559
version of the file

536
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,200
so the majority of issues that we

537
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
received there so those are issues on

538
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,400
the gita github site from number 22 to

539
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
61.

540
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,880
none of them was really a showstopper

541
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,000
the majority of issues were targeting

542
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
improvements of the current description

543
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,720
that we have there because in some cases

544
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,400
we had ambiguities

545
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
and

546
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,240
in some cases we had to enhance the

547
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
technical capabilities that we currently

548
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
described so one of those technical

549
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,799
capabilities what was we added support

550
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,919
for nonslash vouchers

551
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,240
and we had some discussion in the design

552
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,720
team or the design team list for that

553
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,559
and that one was basically added to

554
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,559
allow for provisioning of vouchers via

555
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,480
vlc channel

556
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
so that wouldn't have been possible uh

557
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,640
without the non-slice vouchers there

558
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,480
so that was one of the issues raised and

559
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,280
that was integrated

560
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,520
we had a further point a technical point

561
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,440
that was raised regarding the

562
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,400
uh pledge ca third endpoint so current

563
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,120
so

564
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,520
up to version three we only had the ca

565
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,600
thirds input endpoint uh included on the

566
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,240
register side to fetch ca search from

567
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,159
the register but we didn't have a

568
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,440
specific part or a specific endpoint on

569
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,360
the pledge site to provide those ca

570
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,840
certificates and that has been

571
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,280
added

572
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
or enhanced on the

573
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,200
interface to the

574
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,880
on the pledge side

575
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,919
so

576
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,440
that also

577
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,679
came with a requirement at the new

578
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,320
registrar endpoint because uh since in

579
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,000
boosky prm we having we are having the

580
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,080
uh register agent as intermediate

581
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,440
component

582
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,240
where we not have 100 percent trust to

583
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,720
that intermediate component we wanted to

584
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,360
have the ca certs

585
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,760
respond that response that is provided

586
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,400
from the register towards the pledge in

587
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
a signed format

588
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,720
so that the

589
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
that the pledge is aware that the c

590
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,279
asserts were provided from the

591
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,799
from the authorized registrar

592
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,039
so that has been addressed in the draft

593
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,159
and that

594
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,640
basically relates to issue number 21.

595
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,799
then in the

596
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,679
last ietf meeting

597
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,840
113 we had some discussion about the

598
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,559
possibility to have proof of procession

599
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,080
of the registrar's certificate

600
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,760
of the private key

601
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,200
corresponding to the registrar's

602
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,080
certificate for the voucher itself so

603
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,480
that is one reason that we switched uh

604
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,640
that we are using the possibility to

605
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
have multiple signatures on the

606
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,000
the jws voucher that we are using and we

607
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,480
are not only having the

608
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,320
signature of the mother we are also

609
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,240
having the signature of the registrar

610
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,640
now and that provides us proof of

611
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
procession

612
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,520
uh that was missing so far so that means

613
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,600
we now have a similar

614
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,120
mechanism or we

615
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,279
can apply a similar mechanism

616
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,640
uh

617
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,400
like the preliminary

618
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,080
preliminary accept or provisional accept

619
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,039
like we have it in the tls case for the

620
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,720
standard prosky

621
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,320
so that relates to the issues 32 and 49

622
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,000
and uh

623
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
it was discussed already last time the

624
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,640
the change that is now included is that

625
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,480
we made it mandatory because we had some

626
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
back and forth regarding how does the

627
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,080
pledge signal that he wants that

628
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,799
additional signature and what does he do

629
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,880
when he doesn't doesn't get the the

630
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,320
second signature

631
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,640
and so we simplified the case here and

632
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,799
stated that it is always mandatory to

633
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,840
support those these second signature

634
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,320
we also clarified

635
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,799
that the registration

636
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,520
agent itself may collect the pledge

637
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,919
voucher request or the pledge enrollment

638
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,880
request of both in one run or in

639
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,720
different ones

640
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,440
so that that wasn't clearly stated uh

641
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,960
for now but

642
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,960
yeah that has been clarified

643
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,880
so then uh a further comment oh i forgot

644
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,039
to mention the issues here uh further

645
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,159
comment was related to the format of the

646
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,960
subject key identifier and specifically

647
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,360
what we what we take from the subject

648
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,520
key identifier if we take that just a

649
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,960
20

650
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,080
20 byte value or if we take it with the

651
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
framing ace and

652
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,840
information or not so we

653
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,760
described it in a way to just take the

654
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,640
s-kit by the 20

655
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,120
bytes or octets that are

656
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,239
part of the certificate

657
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,840
then

658
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,320
one comment from esko was going into the

659
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,799
direction to avoid the

660
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,000
redefinition of the voucher request

661
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,559
uh so what we did was we in the first

662
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,320
place we did a copy of the voucher

663
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,880
request from the rfc from the guruski

664
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,000
rfc

665
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,480
8995

666
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,600
and instead of redefining it so what we

667
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,240
what we did now is uh we took the

668
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
definition from bruce key and basically

669
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,200
augmented the voucher request to include

670
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,679
the additional values that we need for

671
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,080
uh bluesky prime so that would be the

672
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,400
ancient science certificate and the

673
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,120
agent signed data and

674
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,440
things which are not defined in the in

675
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
the original voucher so that simplifies

676
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,120
the voucher definition at that place

677
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,039
uh what was also requested was an

678
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,600
explanation of the terminology endpoint

679
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,000
as we use it in the document to

680
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,640
make clear that endpoint is used in the

681
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
in the context of a resource rather than

682
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,440
a physical endpoint

683
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,279
of the client

684
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,000
so that was also included and then uh

685
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,919
based on the discussion that we had we

686
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,480
also removed the join proxy in the

687
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,320
overview figure because we we don't

688
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,960
really need the join proxy as the

689
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,279
registrar agent is expected to be uh

690
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,039
to be a helper application for the

691
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,840
registrar and doesn't need to utilize

692
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,960
the joint proxy here and between the

693
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,080
the

694
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,039
pledge itself and the registrar agent

695
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,760
there is no drawing proxy

696
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,960
my classic question is that okay

697
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,679
sure

698
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,399
at the end okay

699
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,840
okay

700
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,399
next steps are based on the on the

701
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,440
review comments we got from esco we have

702
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,480
14 open issues they are partly uh

703
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,200
cleared so i just have to incorporate

704
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
them into the graph

705
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,799
essentially they will be addressed after

706
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,320
this meeting

707
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,360
all of them go into the direction of

708
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
clarifying the handling response codes

709
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,919
and endpoint handling

710
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,080
what also needs to be updated here is

711
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,279
security considerations that

712
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,240
has

713
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,480
seen some some further review

714
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,760
and

715
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,200
we we need to update that

716
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
so as i stated in the

717
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,720
in the

718
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,159
presentation before the pog

719
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,919
implementation has finished

720
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,679
has been finished and

721
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,279
interrupt testing with others is very

722
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,279
welcome

723
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,679
also i said a document shepard for the

724
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,279
document is needed

725
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,559
and

726
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,039
what we as also thinks after addressing

727
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,600
this remaining 40 northern issues we

728
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,960
think that the draft is ready for

729
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,000
working plus core

730
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,799
okay let's

731
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,640
thank you very much for the

732
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,559
uh attention if there are any questions

733
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,919
you said that michael has a question

734
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,600
he's running to the mic

735
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
hello i hope that's loud enough for the

736
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,559
people um

737
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,880
is in the room and um one of the things

738
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,840
i

739
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,760
i'm unclear about so it's a kind of a

740
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,279
question for benoit

741
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,440
um is whether or not we we're augmenting

742
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
yang and we're using it and you were

743
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,559
using it

744
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,520
um

745
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,480
for uh data at rest

746
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,799
and

747
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,480
we have this kind of thing where this

748
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,320
document imports from this document and

749
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,640
that document imports from this one and

750
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,399
actually in the end we kind of actually

751
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,720
want to have something that is just the

752
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,520
union of every of all the extensions

753
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,600
and it's not clear to me because i don't

754
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,760
know enough whether we're really using

755
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,720
yang in the right way this way for this

756
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
and it would be kind of useful if we

757
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,159
could somehow have a

758
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,559
yang doctor review of the whole working

759
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,120
group in some sense like are we actually

760
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
doing it right

761
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,120
or

762
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,240
is there something that we should be

763
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
doing differently before we push you

764
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,360
know four or five documents

765
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,840
to the isg that separately might look

766
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,760
okay but as a group maybe they're wrong

767
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,039
does that make sense to my request

768
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,480
yeah it's a request to you or to someone

769
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,320
else in the yang space

770
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,720
about how are we really doing it right i

771
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,320
just i don't feel confident that we're

772
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,799
doing it right so that's what i wonder

773
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,279
and this document is an example of

774
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,440
where it makes sense in the document

775
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,600
what we're doing but it might not make

776
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,159
sense if you then consider it with three

777
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,679
other documents that are also doing

778
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,000
something similar and i don't know

779
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,440
i don't feel confident that we're

780
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,760
actually

781
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
this is the absolute correct way to do

782
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,440
it and and maybe to add because we are

783
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,679
not aware of anything in the same

784
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,360
fashion that we can use as prior

785
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,240
evidence for data at rest yeah

786
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,559
uh rob wilson cisco uh

787
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,399
i i think if you just give the examples

788
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,320
then would die to ben well to me we can

789
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,000
probably say whether you do it right or

790
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,679
not or it's the right thing so i need

791
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,519
more context about what exactly you're

792
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,880
doing

793
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,720
um

794
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,760
okay

795
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,399
if that works i mean you have or if i

796
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,600
can launch on the brisket design

797
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
meetings is that the right

798
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,519
good place to do it

799
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,279
no yeah okay i would think so too

800
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,720
sorry what what what you're saying in

801
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
terms of trying to discuss this with

802
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,559
some people from young doctors in one

803
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,760
set up brewski design meeting or so yeah

804
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,600
i'm happy to i mean i we can get some

805
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,039
young doctors i think i'd probably have

806
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,880
to make a judgment on it or and get more

807
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,000
help if needs be um so i'm happy to go

808
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,919
well the data at rest aspect is simply

809
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,480
that we're using yang to model digital

810
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,880
artifacts that may just lie on a usb

811
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,760
stick

812
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,519
right as opposed to just you know

813
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,760
querying you know active information

814
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,600
from a running router

815
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,200
i yeah i don't see that that should be

816
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,880
an issue in the sense we also but it's

817
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,919
new we couldn't simply you know steal um

818
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,840
you know from from from a lot of

819
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,600
documents that do the same thing and

820
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
that's why we're nervous so we have

821
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,279
benoit's document i mean you can speak

822
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,600
to of the um

823
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,279
young file format

824
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,200
uh instance data file format so we do

825
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,399
have a document that's gone through

826
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,960
recently to actually have yang data at

827
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,399
rest and a document format for that i

828
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,720
think that's quite right for this

829
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
purpose necessarily because that has

830
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,480
extra metadata stuff that you probably

831
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,559
don't need but so that we are doing yang

832
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,879
data arrest

833
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,639
yeah

834
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,480
but but uh i i would second uh michael's

835
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,159
opinion i mean we had an early young

836
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,720
doctor review of uh what is contained in

837
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,320
the draft so far

838
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,640
but i think

839
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,360
especially giving the last changes where

840
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,480
we essentially made the

841
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,640
the young description dependent on the

842
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,360
young description in bluesky

843
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,960
it would be good to have some some kind

844
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,840
of overall review of the young young

845
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,559
application or young usage uh in the

846
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,799
context of the different boothby graphs

847
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,840
of ruski document

848
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,080
okay i'm giving you the action item

849
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,960
michael

850
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,200
okay

851
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
so i'll take it down as an action item

852
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,159
to schedule that meeting to discuss that

853
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,799
strategy okay

854
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,440
can you can you add the the name of that

855
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,239
document from to the notes which you're

856
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,719
referring to

857
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,879
okay and i have the ai's at the end

858

okay who's next

859
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,839
uh

860
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,159
next number four

861
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,879
this should be me or no

862
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,199
oh

863
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,839
what happens here slow chair fast

864
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,960
participants excellent

865
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,440
all right

866
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,280
do you mean do you need me to click on

867
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,440
anything here

868
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,480
um

869
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,119
i would like to share the slides myself

870
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,280
let's see if it works out

871
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,159
yeah there is a green approve approve

872
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,960
click approve yes

873
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,780
uh now i see a selection of slides

874
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,929
[Music]

875
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,200
but can i share my local version

876
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,119
no not just the the uploaded one other

877
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,640
other

878
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,400
might be possible but i don't remember i

879
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,040
see okay then it doesn't i can also use

880
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,400
the upload

881
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,200
just have done some minor tweaks

882
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,599
i just need to find

883
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,880
yeah sorry

884
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,040
i changed all the number it introduced

885
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,560
numbering but it didn't take it over

886
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,119
here seemingly so

887
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,680
let's see

888
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,000
from

889
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,000
grasp alternative enrollment uh there we

890
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,160
go

891
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,280
yeah work out

892
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,320
thanks

893
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,400
yeah so i'm

894
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
presenting the current status of ruski

895
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,839
ae

896
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,240
which stands for alternative enrollment

897
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,359
protocols for brewski

898
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,240
as we agreed last time we changed the

899
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,640
name or the abbreviation

900
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,720
of this draft from essence and role to

901
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,480
ae

902
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,760
and so also changed

903
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,520
the url of the repository which you can

904
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,280
find here

905
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,720
and

906
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,680
um i've become the editor last time and

907
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,720
stefan fries hendrick brockhouse and

908
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,640
eliot there are

909
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,320
the authors

910
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,280
mainly

911
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,119
and i'm basically the editor

912
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,440
um

913
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,880
just as a uh how to switch to the next

914
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,839
one all right there we go

915
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,880
just just a quick recap of what brewski

916
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,520
ae is about

917
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,400
it's a variant of bruce kl of

918
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,560
vanilla brewski where the initial

919
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,839
voucher exchange stays as it is

920
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,880
um

921
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,839
but then when it comes to the

922
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,599
certificate enrollment

923
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,440
um where usually est is used

924
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
this has been plugged out and

925
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,480
any other

926
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,079
enrollment protocol can be plugged in

927
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,520
for instance

928
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,480
cmc or a cmp

929
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,839
such that

930
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,040
the things

931
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,640
that in this dash dot

932
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,599
box

933
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,760
are

934
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,400
changing can be done according to the

935
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,119
specific protocol at hand for example

936
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,400
whether to get

937
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,960
extra certificates ca certificates

938
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,160
whether maybe

939
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,880
get some certificate attributes

940
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,680
and then um do the of course do the

941
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,160
actual certificate request and get a

942
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,560
response or maybe some extra rounds

943
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,720
could be needed in terms of polling or

944
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,800
whatever the protocol

945
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,200
um allows for

946
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,280
and in the end we do the usual

947
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,000
enrollment status

948
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
from the pledge to the registrar

949
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,960
so the middle part of the protocol is

950
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,280
being generalized

951
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,240
any questions or comments on this

952
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,800
apparently not then

953
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,320
let's see what has been changed um since

954
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,160
last iatf

955
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
um

956
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,119
we have set up two versions

957
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,520
um the first version of one

958
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,560
um

959
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,520
by the way the numbering had to be reset

960
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,480
after

961
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,440
when changing document name so we start

962
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,599
again with version one

963
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,720
um

964
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,839
in this

965
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,680
version one we did the renaming that

966
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,280
already mentioned

967
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,000
i also added the graphics

968
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,680
that you just have seen which i also

969
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,400
presented last time and to alice asked

970
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,599
to

971
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,160
to incorporate this also in the document

972
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,200
itself

973
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,240
which turned out to be quite a

974
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
difficult thing to do giving the

975
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,440
constraints

976
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,359
um in the

977
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,359
format

978
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,920
of figures that are allowed for such

979
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,359
documents

980
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,560
but in the end i think at least got an

981
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,000
black and white um version of them

982
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,839
um

983
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,520
of the uh

984
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,920
of the graphics in there

985
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,000
yeah i apologize for dragging you you

986
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,320
folks into this it's it's great if if

987
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
something went out of that i'm still

988
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,440
very much annoyed about

989
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,240
all the new hurdles that the xml v3 has

990
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,079
has been putting on you know the the

991
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,400
requirements for the documents hopefully

992
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,320
that can be improved over time to make

993
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,160
it easier to get the nice colorful

994
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,040
pictures into rfc's as well sorry go on

995
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,640
oh yeah this would be really nice if we

996
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,839
can do this

997
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,960
at least for later documents

998
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,760
yeah apart from that did some editorial

999
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,280
tweaks uh

1000
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,520
more or less to restructure some of

1001
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,880
the sections

1002
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,640
but not really

1003
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,720
content-wise changes

1004
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,839
and we also added some details of the

1005
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,640
lightweight cmp instance

1006
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
of risky ae

1007
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,280
which

1008
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,040
we just would suggest to call it risky

1009
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,000
uh cmp

1010
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,440
then about a month back

1011
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,240
we

1012
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,359
provided a further version of the draft

1013
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,400
where we clarified one architectural

1014
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,359
thing

1015
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,880
namely

1016
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,359
so far we had written that the registrar

1017
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,880
can act as a local registration

1018
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,200
authority or as a full registration

1019
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,640
authority or as uh and simply as an

1020
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,040
enrollment proxy

1021
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,200
and this proxy may have got

1022
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,800
misunderstood

1023
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,960
as such in a way that

1024
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,520
maybe the registrar has no control

1025
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,400
okay or no insight into what's going on

1026
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,000
um so we clarified this and stated

1027
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,960
that

1028
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,440
in fact the registrar

1029
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,880
is

1030
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,280
can delegate

1031
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,760
so towards the towards the pledge it's

1032
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,920
it's still um the

1033
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,839
the registration authorities

1034
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,480
from from the pledge view but it can

1035
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,800
delegate more or less

1036
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,599
parts or all of this registration

1037
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,599
authority tasks

1038
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,079
to some further back-end server

1039
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,400
so this is no actual change in to the

1040
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,000
contents but

1041
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,480
a clarification of the presentation of

1042
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,119
the contents

1043
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,200
and

1044
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,560
for the cmp instance of ruski

1045
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,760
ae

1046
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,400
we

1047
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,319
just added a reference

1048
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,920
uh to the um to another draft on co-op

1049
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
transport for

1050
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,800
cmp v2

1051
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,359
and another reference

1052
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,240
i'm getting some echo

1053
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,440
hopefully you don't get it as well

1054
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,960
another instance

1055
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,880
reference also two words constrained

1056
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,359
brewski

1057
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,160
because this could also be of interest

1058
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,119
to have

1059
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,119
for example a constrained version of a

1060
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,240
cmp

1061
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,280
um

1062
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,960
with the co-op transport

1063
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,760
uh and this can also combined

1064
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,640
with bruce ke okay if it runs down

1065
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,680
we've also done a poc implementation

1066
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,800
and this was well received also by

1067
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,400
colleagues of us

1068
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,319
who

1069
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,720
got uh the good impression that

1070
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,920
um

1071
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,960
this bruce kae um this would be ready

1072
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,680
for

1073
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,279
incorporation into their products

1074
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,200
are there any comments or questions on

1075
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,078
these topics here

1076
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,160
if not

1077
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,960
let's switch to my final slides

1078
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,280
on open points or potentially open

1079
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,880
points

1080
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,160
um

1081
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,359
the only

1082
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,319
thing where we're still waiting for um

1083
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,680
some

1084
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,560
enhancement or extension would be

1085
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,400
um

1086
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,359
the instantiation of um

1087
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,920
of the enrollment protocol to use

1088
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,119
estival for cmc rather than the

1089
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,240
normal

1090
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,280
simpler version of esd

1091
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,160
there we have been waiting for input

1092
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,800
of elliot

1093
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,599
but so far got didn't get it

1094
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,520
elliot apparently is not here so i

1095
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,640
cannot

1096
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,040
otherwise you could have asked him

1097
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,319
but

1098
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,640
it looks like a new

1099
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,480
job role that keeps him pretty busy but

1100
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,040
you can run into him on

1101
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,240
gather i think more

1102
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,560
so

1103
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,599
i will ask him again and

1104
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:12,560
if

1105
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,160
and when

1106
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,800
some further input from his site

1107
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,599
would be available

1108
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,960
and then

1109
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,640
we would have liked to already have an

1110
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,800
shepherd review from trolleys are you

1111
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,040
still up for doing that

1112
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
yeah let me let me see you know what

1113
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,800
what what the order is i was trying to

1114
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,960
put the uh

1115
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
my ai is on the bottom so it seems the

1116
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,720
brewski cloud maybe

1117
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
is is that higher priority in the list

1118
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,240
how do you folks want to have these

1119
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,118
things serialized

1120
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,680
oh we can take it offline right so just

1121
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
let me know what

1122
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,200
across the different documents how you

1123
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,279
how you feel i should serialize my time

1124
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,359
thanks

1125
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,839
yeah we would also appreciate further

1126
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,440
reviews from

1127
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,800
other wrecking group members

1128
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,880
and let me take this opportunity and

1129
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,440
asked is there anyone around

1130
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,359
who might be interested in doing so

1131
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,520
i would i would recommend to everybody

1132
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,200
just you know to to go through the list

1133
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,040
of you know active participants in the

1134
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,880
group and and figure out who seems like

1135
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,720
a good candidate and reach out

1136
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,560
individually in email

1137
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,800
you know these these broad questions uh

1138
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,960
you you can almost

1139
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,880
no reply from anybody who's busy right

1140
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,200
so but if you ask them individually

1141
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,119
and maybe you also you know offer your

1142
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,119
help with their document that that goes

1143
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,040
a much longer way

1144
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,160
thanks i'll do that

1145
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,200
yeah

1146
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,880
and

1147
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,720
the final question is whether the

1148
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,119
document is already ready for waking

1149
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,440
group last call

1150
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,040
so from our perspective it's pretty much

1151
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,160
so

1152
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,359
except if anything pops up during some

1153
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,599
some um

1154
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,440
of the

1155
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,680
next review

1156
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,760
yeah that's that's it for my site

1157
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,640
are there maybe any other

1158
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,598
comments or questions

1159
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,680
yeah um

1160
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,880
for for the folks in the room uh

1161
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,040
maybe you know we we can we can always

1162
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,359
do do they ask who has read the document

1163
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,280
um

1164
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,440
said

1165
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,839
how was it your show of hands tools

1166
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,240
okay

1167
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,440
okay so we had 14 people participating

1168
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,040
six said they had read the document

1169
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,880
eight said they didn't have so that's

1170
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,800
already good

1171
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,559
into the notes

1172
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,800
thank you

1173
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,440
and one of those who have read would be

1174
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,680
nice

1175
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,319
didn't notice who it was

1176
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,760
so if you

1177
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,160
could let us know would be nice but

1178
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,920
otherwise we can also try to find other

1179
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,520
i'm not sure if that tool actually tells

1180
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,680
us to listen yeah

1181
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,640
yeah

1182
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,599
so

1183
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,480
if

1184
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,640
yeah let's see

1185
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,280
if anyone comes up to do a review formal

1186
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,839
review thank you

1187
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,559
okay

1188
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,880
um

1189
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,280
they're not more questions

1190
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,119
again right in terms of in terms of the

1191
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,440
reviews if i haven't checked the latest

1192
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,720
version of the document if you've been

1193
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,559
trying who if you've been tracking in

1194
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,480
the changelog who has provided feedback

1195
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,599
and you know

1196
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,760
read the document um if if that's in

1197
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,520
there that that would be the first thing

1198
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,599
i you know we chairs and

1199
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,400
uh would be looking into to judge how

1200
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,160
close it is to to working group last

1201
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,520
call

1202
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,640
i will add this information

1203
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,119
okay then i think we're up for uh

1204
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,880
kyung chow

1205
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,079
for the enema distribution the the grasp

1206
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,520
distribution yes exactly so how uh how

1207
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,400
could i show my screen or

1208
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,200
or

1209
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,680
you need to click on the uh share slides

1210
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,440
share slice

1211
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,359
share pre pre-loaded slides it's always

1212
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,920
there yeah okay yes and then i approve

1213
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,359

number four or

1217
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,359
slice number four yes

1218
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,558
oops sure

1219
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,800
is it showing up already yep yeah okay

1220
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,839
okay great great so hello everybody uh

1221
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,920
good afternoon good morning good evening

1222
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,280
so

1223
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,960
i'm now in germany so

1224
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,520
it's already uh not late night but it's

1225
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,040
almost late

1226
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,440
okay so since we didn't got a chance for

1227
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,200
the last meeting you know because of

1228
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,079
internal let's say approval issue so we

1229
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,240
didn't get a goal to attend this meeting

1230
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,640
so we could not

1231
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,440
register itf

1232
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,880
130 so but this time we got a goal so we

1233
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,680
can

1234
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,119
come here and then do some updates

1235
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,079
so

1236
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,880
this slide is about the version five for

1237
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,599
the

1238
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,640
grass

1239
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,720
grass distribution

1240
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,599
okay next page uh this is a short

1241
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,200
reminder

1242
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,680
the main content of the draft is about

1243
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,440
how to

1244
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,280
re-utilize the

1245
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,280
let's say the grasp

1246
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,359
protocol api

1247
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,640
with a very limited extension so that we

1248
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,400
can have enhanced

1249
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,960
uh information distribution module

1250
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,240
for the whole

1251
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,480
ani so this is

1252
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,880
our main target

1253
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,440
next page so here's

1254
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,319
some

1255
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:39,359
short

1256
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,720
that's a short briefing since uh

1257
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,720
112 130. so we updated from version two

1258
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,960
to four the main change here is that we

1259
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,640
took the first also

1260
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,920
and we moved zora and then brands name

1261
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,599
to the acknowledgement

1262
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,640
and we've

1263
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,960
focused on polishing the use cases and

1264
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,640
requirements according to the

1265
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,359
the comments from the main list

1266
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,440
but this time we

1267
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,119
went into more details you know

1268
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,599
according to the comments provided by

1269
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:12,960
our

1270
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,720
shepherd michael

1271
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,359
so we go one by one

1272
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,480
from his review comment so we made some

1273
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,119
updates from version four to

1274
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,119
version five

1275
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,000
okay

1276
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,160
so here's our

1277
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,319
some comments that we have addressed in

1278
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,680
this version so the first one is that um

1279
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,760
the review comments says that the use

1280
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,599
case section is okay

1281
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,319
but it seems that automotive example uh

1282
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,839
seems uh

1283
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,920
not to have the real world demand at

1284
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,280
this point

1285
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,760
in general we

1286
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,720
can

1287
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,640
we we we actually agree on these

1288
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,640
comments but uh

1289
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,720
and and we are

1290
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,440
we're and we are thinking that this part

1291
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,559
could

1292
00:51:58,559 --> 00:51:59,680
let's say

1293
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,440
we would like to keep this kind of you

1294
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,240
know

1295
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,559
use case because we

1296
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,520
at at some point maybe um

1297
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,920
let's say the the end point with

1298
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,640
mobility could be part of the sap

1299
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,760
although although it's not uh let's take

1300
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,839
considered

1301
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,160
with the acp setting yet but we think

1302
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,720
this could be our nice futuristic

1303
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,760
use case if the mobility kind of let's

1304
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,119
say featured

1305
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,000
can be included or can be part of the

1306
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,960
the whole

1307
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,800
ami but we can discuss of course um so

1308
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,040
but we add some clarifications and

1309
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,359
putting down

1310
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,880
its gap to the existing scope of the ni

1311
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,559
that's in this version

1312
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,839
and another comment about the

1313
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,559
the use case part is that it pointed out

1314
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,440
um whatever the c2p management functions

1315
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,720
could be let's say performed with an ali

1316
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,760
but

1317
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,400
but actually right now cpub

1318
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,960
does not

1319
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,200
use the grasp protocol of course and you

1320
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,040
use http 2.0 and json you know for this

1321
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,839
use

1322
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:10,800
um

1323
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,720
but this is a kind of like our whole

1324
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,720
motivation you know behind that because

1325
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,240
we think there are huge potential uh and

1326
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,119
even internally when we are discussing

1327
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,359
let's say in huawei we also promote less

1328
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,200
animals work because we

1329
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,880
think there are huge potential where

1330
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,920
animals work let's say concept protocols

1331
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,800
and architecture and so on could play

1332
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,720
play a very important role in 3gb

1333
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,960
network

1334
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,240
let's say

1335
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,520
it's not that easy that we fully replace

1336
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,559
as everything in http with anima but i

1337
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,280
think it's a very good good good idea to

1338
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,440
say that okay

1339
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,079
how about the 3d network architecture

1340
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,960
even part of that could be let's say

1341
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,720
dumb

1342
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,040
but animals work let's say protocol even

1343
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,480
architecture that that could be very

1344
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,040
nice so this is why we we

1345
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,480
keep this http use case

1346
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,480
in our draft

1347
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,280
okay and the the last one is the last

1348
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,800
one is that we

1349
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,240
actually mentioned the in-network

1350
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,040
computing capability let's say features

1351
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,720
uh but the

1352
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,640
by the common sense that there is

1353
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,720
um

1354
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,720
no reference so we added one reference

1355
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,680
for that uh if let's say if needed we

1356
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,920
can add it more

1357
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,359
okay so let's move on

1358
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,280
do you take comments here

1359
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,079
in the middle

1360
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,119
sorry

1361
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,040
are you asking me

1362
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,559
is it okay to provide comments in the

1363
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,240
middle uh and not only at the end

1364
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,920
because of course of course of course of

1365
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,880
course of course of course yes so so so

1366
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,920
for the first point um i think it may be

1367
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
useful to remember that originally when

1368
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,040
we were doing

1369
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,160
enema um the idea was to replace the

1370
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,960
whole control plane um yes with an

1371
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,200
autonomically built one and we just you

1372
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,200
know degenerated so to speak to an

1373
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,440
additional acp

1374
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,160
and uh that concept certainly is most

1375
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,559
useful when you want to get the a into

1376
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,559
existing equipment

1377
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,799
service provider routers i think in the

1378
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,640
case of

1379
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,400
these these futuristic

1380
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,319
er styles we may get it back to the

1381
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,400
original vision of anima where the

1382
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,799
autonomically formed secure

1383
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,280
um routing infrastructure would be you

1384
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,520
know the only network that you have

1385
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,640
and

1386
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,240
actually would be then a layer three

1387
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,240
equivalent to what most of these iot

1388
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,920
networks already have which is you know

1389
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,240
each technology has its own

1390
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,200
um layer two you know uh security

1391
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,440
mechanism and and that also

1392
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,280
you know creates a lot of unnecessary

1393
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,480
islands so i think

1394
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,720
you know um thingy is necessary if

1395
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,839
uh if i may be able to help in improving

1396
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,640
that writing so because i think

1397
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,960
this this to me shows a lot more closer

1398
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,040
to what the reality in the future could

1399
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,839
be give or take the market forces and

1400
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,359
now i'm just uh

1401
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,880
ranting here because my network

1402
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,280
connection seems to drop me off and i'm

1403
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,680
happy that you folks can't even hear me

1404
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,440
unstable connection to the server trying

1405
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,520
to reconnect i can't hear you

1406
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,599
oh i can hear you clearly it's okay yeah

1407
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:20,799
yeah

1408
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,400
okay now you can hear you can see the

1409
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,160
slides again okay

1410
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,040
yeah

1411
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,119
that was the main point and uh that i

1412
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,799
wanted to make thank you

1413
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,440
okay okay then i will continue so this

1414
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,799
is uh really about some replies uh to

1415
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,359
the comments about the use case you know

1416
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,040
from the shepherd but of course there

1417
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,960
are you know many comments we didn't

1418
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,400
address so far

1419
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,359
uh but we will handle that as a later

1420
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,640
and then it comes to a very encouraging

1421
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,920
comment that

1422
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,040
the the shepherds think the data backup

1423
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,280
could be a very interesting

1424
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,400
could be a

1425
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,040
very interesting functions for ai

1426
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,680
and scpo of course we also agree

1427
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,960
uh so

1428
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,880
then um but

1429
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,079
it also pointed out that the use case um

1430
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,400
aside from the

1431
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,119
data backup uh

1432
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,000
it

1433
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,160
does not seem actually to be relevant to

1434
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,839
to the ami and acp so

1435
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,760
then we think

1436
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,839
later on we should look into more

1437
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,680
details about the

1438
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,640
the data backup use case and see if we

1439
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,280
should keep this use case

1440
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,359
and then following this

1441
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:37,119
comment the there is one comment about

1442
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,760
saying that we should mate let's say

1443
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,160
this document more protocol-oriented

1444
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,440
description

1445
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,000
and it it refers to

1446
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,119
um

1447
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,000
this mainly discussion but we

1448
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,760
we actually checked that this million is

1449
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,920
discussion but the the latter request

1450
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,319
actually suggests that the opposite so

1451
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,200
less product oriented description so

1452
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,160
here there's a little bit confusion uh

1453
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,880
probably we can also let's check it out

1454
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,240
later

1455
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,319
whether or not we should make it more

1456
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,280
let's say product oriented or less work

1457
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,040
oriented

1458
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,599
okay so

1459
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,980
yes um

1460
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,240
[Music]

1461
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,920
then it goes to

1462
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,440
then the order comments for section

1463
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,559
2 are done here

1464
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,920
and then it goes to section 3.

1465
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,680
first of words pointed out and

1466
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,720
let's say the pops and sub

1467
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,480
you know features for the information

1468
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,359
distribution could be a be

1469
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,720
let's say

1470
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,960
less capable for when the network size

1471
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,160
getting larger and denser

1472
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,319
so probably uh here um

1473
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,799
and we we should

1474
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,040
refer more works so we actually added

1475
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,000
some representative reference uh here uh

1476
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,839
in our

1477
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,760
number five version

1478
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,920
and we also did a

1479
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,720
minor change you know about this rfc

1480
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,920
so the common set it should be

1481
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,920
let's say

1482
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,880
normative you know reference okay

1483
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,040
so this is the major change we

1484
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:19,839
made

1485
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:20,559
from

1486
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,280
two to four and four to five

1487
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,400
um

1488
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,400
then there are some problems also

1489
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,720
pointed out um

1490
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,839
let's say

1491
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,559
it says that the government doesn't

1492
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:33,920
provide a reasonable security

1493
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,520
consideration so

1494
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,599
yes of course uh we didn't reach that

1495
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,040
far yet so we are asking what are what

1496
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,160
or what we should consider let's say

1497
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,480
the security aspect so this is the first

1498
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,440
issue

1499
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,720
and the second issue is is is about the

1500
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,359
writing i think so we

1501
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,079
we of course lack of the experience of

1502
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,200
how to

1503
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,960
write a proper

1504
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,839
less itf draft so we in most of the

1505
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:03,680
cases we use can

1506
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,319
so we didn't quite differentiate in

1507
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,559
which scenario we should use should or

1508
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,880
must or let's say is there any certain

1509
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,520
rule that we should follow this

1510
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,440
kind of you know

1511
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,920
word should and must so

1512
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,920
probably we we should also check it out

1513
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,280
okay so

1514
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,240
of course

1515
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,359
there are

1516
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,599
many other problems that we didn't touch

1517
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,839
uh from the comments and opinions

1518
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,920
provided by surfer but we will also

1519
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,400
handle that in the next version

1520
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,520
uh

1521
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,680
then the future works uh you know as i

1522
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,760
said we should we will let's say

1523
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,400
continue but i would also take this

1524
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,480
opportunity to to to ask let's say

1525
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,799
more attentions and maybe

1526
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,599
more group reviews so that we can really

1527
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,839
speed up the process of the

1528
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,400
of this document of course we can keep

1529
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,280
revising the as the document but it

1530
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,680
seems endless we certainly need very

1531
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,559
concrete action items or deadlines

1532
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,160
maybe in this year by the end of this

1533
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,000
year so that

1534
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,040
we can go for the last core

1535
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,279
yes

1536
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,920
yeah this is from my side

1537
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,079
right so thank you so coming from my

1538
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,720
side if you go to the the the last slide

1539
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,640
before this yeah here right so i i think

1540
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,799
um you know um

1541
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,079
an explicit implementable example of how

1542
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,079
to apply these mechanisms would

1543
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,599
certainly be helpful

1544
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,680
right okay um it could be started just

1545
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,559
an appendix but really just the explicit

1546
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,559
grasp methods right who is talking with

1547
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,520
whom why are they doing it and how then

1548
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,240
are explicit you know grasp objectives

1549
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:46,960
uh

1550
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,680
exchanged how right um

1551
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,000
whether you implement that actually in

1552
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,240
any prototype code maybe on on top of

1553
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,839
brian's

1554
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,480
grasp implementation or so on that would

1555
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,480
of course be icing on the cake but you

1556
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,400
know the whole point is you know

1557
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,039
existence proof of an implementable

1558
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:06,799
um

1559
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:08,880
adaptation of the method in this

1560
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,240
document

1561
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,880
right okay because otherwise it's it's

1562
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,200
it's always you know hard to figure out

1563
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,440
well i can guess i could apply this way

1564
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,480
but you know once i see yes yes i agree

1565
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,079
yes you're right and you would want to

1566
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,480
start specifying this out in in text

1567
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,920
first before you

1568
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,079
um try to implement it and you know

1569
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,319
maybe you know the the people

1570
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,359
concerned here about the the lack of

1571
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,680
linkage to reality would already be

1572
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,520
happy just to see that written down but

1573
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,200
i think it's it's certainly the best

1574
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,839
starting point to resolve this issue

1575
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,920
okay okay i understand i actually have a

1576
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,520
question about this uh

1577
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,920
following up your comment so

1578
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,240
do you think that we should uh really

1579
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,319
let's say consider a very specific use

1580
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,000
case or scenario

1581
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,440
let's say

1582
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,000
does it is it necessary to really have a

1583
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,359
very concrete

1584
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,160
example to really say that okay this is

1585
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,039
the entity in which uh let's say in

1586
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,520
which application in which scenario in

1587
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,880
which kind of

1588
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,359
network or something like this or just

1589
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,760
kind of very generalized the

1590
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,440
functionality

1591
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,960
you know implementation or something

1592
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,160
like this

1593
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,520
so to to what kind of extent or scope

1594
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,599
that do we really have to consider

1595
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,720
is proof of concept

1596
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,960
michael richardson at the mic

1597
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,319
yeah thank you thank you yeah hello um

1598
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,440
yeah um yeah you need to

1599
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,880
tell us

1600
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,799
i don't see any point in the document

1601
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,799
unless it actually describes something

1602
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,039
that someone can implement

1603
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,400
right so

1604
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,760
um

1605
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,520
it's nice to wish for

1606
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,160
3gpp to take on your stuff

1607
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,920
um we also wish yes but

1608
01:03:56,839 --> 01:04:00,000
um mean unless they're actually doing it

1609
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,960
or then i don't see the point or

1610
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,079
um

1611
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,119
maybe you want to implement it in your

1612
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,280
3gpp equipment

1613
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,000
um or 5g equipment

1614
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,160
then great describe it how it works okay

1615
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,160
even if that means the document is

1616
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,319
describing your implementation and not

1617
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,000
necessarily a standard and it has to

1618
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,160
become informational okay but that's

1619
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,599
still really useful

1620
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,000
um but a general document about you

1621
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,359
could do stuff

1622
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:31,359
i don't i don't see the point

1623
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:32,960
i don't even see the point in reviewing

1624
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,359
it further so i mean really

1625
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:36,480
i mean

1626
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,000
if if you're trying to describe

1627
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,319
something then please describe it in

1628
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,720
real concrete details with you know that

1629
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,880
someone can actually implement ideally

1630
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,880
that you've actually implemented

1631
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,079
so

1632
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,240
um

1633
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,200
that's what i'm encouraging right yeah

1634
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,119
maybe maybe to help

1635
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:57,839
some um

1636
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,599
productive detail on that right so i

1637
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:02,160
think when you're referring to um

1638
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,559
specific standard bodies

1639
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,400
and how they could do things when it

1640
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,000
seems to be clear that they're already

1641
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,440
on a different track

1642
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,880
that's that's that's always a bad

1643
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,200
reference right so it's you know try to

1644
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,280
to find a reference

1645
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,839
i mean the the benefit on how to do it

1646
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,280
the the exact

1647
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,799
example um

1648
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:24,240
that that describe the detail of

1649
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,240
um you know the grass method everything

1650
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,920
necessary to implement that that's one

1651
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,400
part the applicability to

1652
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,559
to a particular use case scenario for

1653
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,440
that that should just be you know as

1654
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,680
specific as possible but not you know in

1655
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,839
contradiction to what we know some

1656
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,520
particular part in the industry has

1657
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,319
chosen right so this

1658
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,480
this is like you know okay yeah okay you

1659
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,319
can't come up with so let's say

1660
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,400
i'm sure that that that that can can be

1661
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,079
overcome right

1662
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,640
okay okay i understand so uh

1663
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,640
then it means that in my understanding

1664
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,680
if i'm correct uh we can let's say just

1665
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,039
stop at the the levels saying that this

1666
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,000
is the node and this the node this node

1667
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,400
has implements the functionality

1668
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,960
that we propose in the document then

1669
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,640
it's sufficient we don't have to say

1670
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,920
that

1671
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,319
what node it is and

1672
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,640
let's say it's a very specific node for

1673
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,039
example it's as a network node running

1674
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:25,599
in 5g network or usb network or it's a

1675
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,599
let's say vehicle or

1676
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,160
it's an iot device or something like

1677
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,480
this or

1678
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,480
the most concrete

1679
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,000
write down of um

1680
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,559
an example and and and and we'll

1681
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,640
basically start discussing it from there

1682
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,799
right to to to refine it to a point that

1683
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:51,200
that we're satisfied with it

1684
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,280
okay okay

1685
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,319
yes i mean

1686
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:55,680
look at some of the prior prior

1687
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,880
documents i think it's uh rfc 899 who

1688
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,200
one or two there is one

1689
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,920
from shang young and others for um you

1690
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,520
know example applicability of grasp

1691
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,599
um so that that

1692
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,359
went one step further in the level of

1693
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:12,720
details

1694
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,359
okay okay

1695
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,760
yeah yeah come on

1696
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,520
and we will do that yes

1697
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,720
hello shane

1698
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,319
you have some comment

1699
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,960
yes we can hear you

1700
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,599
oh yeah uh my recommendation for this

1701
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,760
question would be first

1702
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,440
we can

1703
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,119
spend a little bit

1704
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,240
text to describe a use case

1705
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,319
as started

1706
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:41,280
as teres suggested then

1707
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,000
we should focus on a

1708
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,240
standardized

1709
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,240
scenario which

1710
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,880
is generalized

1711
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,599
if there's something

1712
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,960
you know too specific to certain use

1713
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,079
case

1714
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,520
we can have

1715
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,559
the appendix

1716
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,640
that would make this

1717
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,000
document focus enough but also

1718
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,680
have enough uh use case information

1719
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,200
for the audience right

1720
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,719
okay okay

1721
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,960
if we will consider that

1722
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,120
yes probably we

1723
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,158
say

1724
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:24,880
let's hope if we have enough resources

1725
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,560
maybe in the next version let's at the

1726
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,560
end of the year we can let's provide

1727
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,158
something

1728
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:32,238
on the table regarding the

1729
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,158
implementation or just functional

1730
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:37,198
descriptions or concrete examples yes

1731
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,839
yeah we will do that

1732
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,158
okay so

1733
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:46,319
is there any other comments

1734
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,960
from other audience

1735
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,600
now um i think we can happily take this

1736
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,000
this this to the list and uh you know

1737
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,679
please please start on

1738
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:02,560
uh

1739
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,640
on the steps that uh

1740
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,238
yeah we gave you here and if you have

1741
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:08,158
any more questions let's let's do that

1742
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,000
actively on the list

1743
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,120

thank you

1745
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,799
okay uh update on constraint brewski and

1746
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:26,158
join proxy and that would be

1747
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:28,640
mr richardson

1748
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,920
no i don't think network service auto

1749
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,600
deployment no that was this right yep

1750
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,040

slides for the participants on remote it

1766
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,880
takes less bandwidth and and it's larger

1767
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,560
on the screen but if this is the best

1768
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,600
you can do that's fine as well

1769

okay

1789
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:31,120
let's start

1790
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,400
i'm using and this slope is about the

1791
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,840
draft

1792
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,840
auto deployment mechanism for

1793
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,480
resource-based network surveys and at

1794
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,679
first uh i will have a short review

1795
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:46,640
about

1796
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,800
the draft and

1797
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,320
this strategy we want to discuss

1798
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,440
the question about how to establish a

1799
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,800
set of

1800
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,679
autonomic negotiation mechanism to

1801
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,640
achieve the negotiation and the

1802
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,360
distribution of the natural resource in

1803
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,719
the domain network between the surveys

1804
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,000
and the

1805
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,800
network and the the

1806
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,520
key point of our goal is

1807
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,400
establish autonomic negotiation

1808
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,120
mechanism

1809
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,400
and the this is a major change from the

1810
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,000
ietf one month three seasons and uh i

1811
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,320
also received some comments from the

1812
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,080
brian and

1813
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,880
in this meeting i want to explain my

1814
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,520
thoughts about this comment and i want

1815
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,320
to

1816
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,800
talk about some major changes from the

1817
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,120
itfu biomass resistance so first thing

1818
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,000
is that i add some picture in the

1819
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,040
session

1820
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,480
for to

1821
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,199
uh to discuss the process of the

1822
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:56,640
resource negotiation i think this is uh

1823
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,640
important things and

1824
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,440
will make our workforce to understand

1825
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,840
and i will introduce

1826
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,080
this in the next page

1827
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:10,000
and the second is that i add a grasp

1828
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,800
objective example use case in the

1829
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,560
section 6

1830
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,159
6 1 and i talked about this use case as

1831
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,120
a last meeting and

1832
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,920
i updated in it into this new version

1833
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,760
the third is that

1834
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,560
i

1835
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,159
this has some

1836
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,920
compassion with other technology and

1837
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,800
brian suggests that we should discuss

1838
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,120
more about the night and

1839
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,719
i plan to do this in the next step

1840
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:47,120
uh the last thing is that i created some

1841
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,000
text error

1842
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,360
okay this page is about auto deployment

1843
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,640
process

1844
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,199
and in this auto deployment process we

1845
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:04,480
talked about how the two different kinds

1846
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,199
of asa can communicate

1847
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:10,000
with each other and how to

1848
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,040
uh this to uh how it translates to asia

1849
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,280
negotiations resource

1850
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,320
and in this process we can

1851
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,280
warehouse a three stage the discovery

1852
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,239
stage under the negotiation stage and

1853
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,159
the

1854
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,960
after negotiation what is uh

1855
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,360
to assad should do

1856
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,800
and uh

1857
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,000
in this

1858
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,159
process we

1859
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:39,600
will add in this new version underway at

1860
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,239
the new staff about the sacred

1861
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:44,960
synchronization to other asa

1862
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,360
and we added this in the after

1863
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,560
negotiation uh after negotiations are

1864
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,679
two different kind of asean

1865
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:55,280
nato

1866
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,159
a negotiation with salt and so providing

1867
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:01,600
resource management asa removes

1868
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,080
accessible results from its resource

1869
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:04,960
poor

1870
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,920
and after that we will synchronization

1871
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,040
to other as a whole

1872
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,280
the

1873
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,960
negotiation results and exercises uh

1874
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,159
request resource manager asa can tell us

1875
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:23,280
so why such as uh resource resource

1876
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,800
nation is

1877
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,600
ready under the service time

1878
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,000
uses resource

1879
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,159
center package

1880
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:35,600
and this is about the auto deployment

1881
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,880
process

1882
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,760
and the in this page we want to talk

1883
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,199
about some

1884
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:42,400
uh

1885
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,600
uncomfortable with other technologies

1886
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,600
uh this draft we think is not a

1887
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,360
resource resurination portal but

1888
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,880
a mechanism to enable the survives under

1889
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:57,760
the

1890
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,840
network to nato a negotiation how much

1891
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,880
resource

1892
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,120
the networks can provide for the surveys

1893
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,880
so and

1894
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,760
this draft is different from other

1895
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,199
particles is that it can

1896
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,760
it can support the multi-round

1897
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,560
negotiation mechanism and supports

1898
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,480
multiple type of

1899
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,640
resource negotiation

1900
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,000
and the

1901
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,440
and as for 39 we seemed that

1902
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,280
this mechanism supports a

1903
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,360
negotiation of the resource

1904
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,560
uh for the denied surveys and the this

1905
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,320
draft of racing

1906
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,960
can be considered as a distribution

1907
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,120
solution of the

1908
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,840
denied resource damage negotiation

1909
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,040
and the about the

1910
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,360
society consideration

1911
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,440
and the in this

1912
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,880
new washing we say that

1913
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,120
this draft

1914
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,239
doesn't want to introduction the action

1915
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:09,760
security problems for anima and the

1916
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,199
uh wasting uh

1917
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:14,719
some

1918
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,280
eyes and i think there's a discussion

1919
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,560
about some society matter is out of

1920
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,960
this draft scrub and i think

1921
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:25,920
some

1922
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,679
some security problem is a common

1923
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:30,640
problem

1924
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,320
for example

1925
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,960
brian asked me some

1926
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,199
some question about multiple domain

1927
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,560
network

1928
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,440
and this icing and

1929
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,600
as i've seen

1930
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,840
9 2 2 2 and it says that this will be a

1931
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,159
possible weight part

1932
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:53,679
and i think is a necessary to

1933
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,199
establish some rule to

1934
01:17:56,199 --> 01:17:59,600
retrace the about some

1935
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,120
about this the quality consider province

1936
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,640
and i think

1937
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,239
we need a separate draft to this passage

1938
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,280
and

1939
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,080
this is not our

1940
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,679
drafts i want to discuss

1941
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,320
and

1942
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:22,159
for the next step and we want to

1943
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:23,040
uh

1944
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,000
we plan to do the following things the

1945
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,280
first thing is that we want to update

1946
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,480
the autonomic resource management

1947
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,000
objectives

1948
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,800
uh

1949
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,760
with i think that there are some un

1950
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,360
non-standard writing of the

1951
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,040
new washing drafts and it caused some

1952
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,400
misunderstanding so

1953
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,120
stands for brian's half and

1954
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,880
he gave me some

1955
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,480
related

1956
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,400
paper and i will

1957
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,280
represent carefully and update in the

1958
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,880
next version

1959
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,480
uh and the

1960
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:04,400
next uh next question is about two ways

1961
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,159
we should consider

1962
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:10,719
more about uh is practice scenarios

1963
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,480
uh for example

1964
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,000
um if

1965
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,480
if the resource state change in the

1966
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,600
network

1967
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,159
and the what we should do something to

1968
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:23,199
ensure the right resource and

1969
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:26,000
maybe we should talk

1970
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,679
about this more detailedly and i think i

1971
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:30,960
should

1972
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,640
add an example

1973
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,920
in section

1974
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,480
6 to discussions

1975
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,640
this question

1976
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,320
and that's all

1977
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,040
and

1978
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,360
welcome to through my

1979
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,360
comments and the

1980
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:49,719
contribution thank you

1981
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,840
thanks

1982
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,040
um

1983
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:57,360
let me just back to the notes here

1984
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,159
i was wondering um have have you done

1985
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:05,199
any prototype implementation for example

1986
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,719
also on top of

1987
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,199
brian's grasp

1988
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:12,199
implementation

1989
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,440
uh

1990
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,919
did you hear me

1991
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:38,800
okay i think we might have lost some

1992
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,800
connection

1993
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:55,599
oh okay i think we've

1994
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,159
it's strange

1995
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,519
right

1996
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,440
huh

1997
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,199
what she was talking the whole time is

1998
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,840
she did you mute yourself

1999
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,679
one second i mean

2000
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,840
see

2001
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:22,880
i don't think i need to unmute her i

2002
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,520
think she can talk

2003
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,880
so you if you if you can hear us please

2004
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,480
get back to the microphone so that we

2005
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,760
can

2006
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,080
discuss this further

2007
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,159
for for any questions or so

2008
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,159
otherwise we'll just move on to the next

2009
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:51,120
slot first but we can return to this uh

2010
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,400
if you if

2011
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:57,080
if you get back to being able to talk

2012
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:05,199
alright which first brings us to

2013
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:10,320
mr richardson i hope

2014
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,320
update on constraint brewski which seems

2015
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,199
to be primarily the uh

2016
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:18,480
join proxy can you pull the slides out

2017
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,719
oh no it's me okay yeah you have to do

2018
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:23,920
it yeah yeah yeah yeah watching

2019
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,520
materials uh where is it in a second not

2020
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,520
share screen the microphone should be in

2021
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,800
front of the app

2022
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,840
right yeah well ask me so

2023
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,280
i'm having to

2024
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,480
constrain join proxy changes is that the

2025
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,360
one

2026
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,080
i hope like a nightclub singer here

2029
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,040
okay so this is a i'm michael richardson

2030
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,199
um this is an update on constrain join

2031
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,239
proxy which was in

2032
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,080
wasn't working group has been through

2033
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,360
working last call has gone to visit

2034
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,199
rob has come back

2035
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:02,239
and

2036
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,320
it's also an update on the constrained

2037
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,800
voucher document um and you'll

2038
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,000
understand where next slide please

2039
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,719
so

2040
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:11,679
um

2041
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:14,159
big thing that we did is that we moved a

2042
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,480
lot of the discovery text that was in or

2043
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,320
the discovery protocol definition that

2044
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,760
was in uh constrained joint proxy we

2045
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,239
moved it into constrained voucher

2046
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:25,840
and then we said so we said this is how

2047
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,840
you do it for the state full way

2048
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,280
traditionally

2049
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,600
and then we said this is how you do it

2050
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,719
for the case that it's stateless

2051
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:35,920
so

2052
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,120
um

2053
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,080
if you are looking are a red are a joint

2054
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,679
proxy and you're looking for a registrar

2055
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,719
um then the registrar and grasp speak

2056
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:49,280
should announce itself

2057
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:52,400
with an ip proto udp

2058
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,600
and a

2059
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,840
5684 or other arbitrary port on which

2060
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,679
it's going to run co-op

2061
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:00,800
and

2062
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,400
it should announce it with an objective

2063
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,480
of brewski jp

2064
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,239
which in brewski it's just an empty

2065
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,600
string we should have put something in

2066
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,280
there but we didn't

2067
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,800
so then if you in fact support um other

2068
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,280
protocols um for instance the stateless

2069
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,480
protocol then we say in joint proxy you

2070
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,920
should and this is the bottom of the

2071
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,440
screen in blue

2072
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,199
um you should announce it with brucey

2073
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,920
rjp as your target and then a different

2074
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,159
port number

2075
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:32,159
pardon me do you see your screen

2076
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:33,760
you're not seeing a screen not seeing

2077
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,480
anything shared

2078
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,679
yeah

2079
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:39,679
um can we get some more remote

2080
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,719
participants are you getting video

2081
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:45,719
uh

2082
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,800
can't understand them actually

2083
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:03,760
okay reconnect next slide please yep

2084
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:09,280
um okay so if you in fact are a pledge

2085
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,960
and you're looking for

2086
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,639
a joint proxy

2087
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:13,520
um

2088
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,480
then

2089
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,520
and if you want to find one that does

2090
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,880
uh co-op constrained uh voucher join

2091
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,960
then you would see that by an

2092
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,760
announcement that says it's a udp

2093
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,800
and we put in the string there dtls

2094
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,480
um and you'd see a port number that's an

2095
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,159
arbitrary port number despite the fact

2096
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,639
that i can't spell properly it's a not

2097
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,120
an abbottary but an arbitrary port

2098
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,239
number

2099
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,320
and the important part is that in the

2100
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,320
join proxy in the constrain point proxy

2101
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,920
there's no change because from the

2102
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,920
pledge point of view it doesn't matter

2103
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,239
whether the joint proxy is is uh doing a

2104
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:49,280
stateful

2105
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,159
um

2106
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:52,560
uh join where it stores its state in

2107
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,639
memory or whether it's doing a stateless

2108
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,159
join where essentially it stores its

2109
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:59,679
state in the network next slide

2110
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:01,040
different topic oh wait are there

2111
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,239
questions about that topic

2112
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:06,880
um no i think this this is finally the

2113
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,360
the question is how can we be as nice as

2114
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,360
we are in grasp with this uh with the

2115
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,280
other discovery methods right

2116
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,760
um yeah so so the document goes through

2117
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,000
it and mdns but it's less i guess it's

2118
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,440
less visually interesting so i didn't

2119
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,199
put it in the slide please look at the

2120
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,880
diff um it's basically just you look for

2121
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,159
a particular name brewski dot jp or

2122
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:30,960
brewski dot rjp and there's not any

2123
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,280
difference it's you know it's a target

2124
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,840
you look for so it's less beautiful if

2125
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,000
it's not in grasp i think i think my

2126
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,400
major um unresolved the the unresolved

2127
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,199
thing i think we have is with um

2128
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,679
uh core right yeah co-op is coming okay

2129
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,280
co-op is coming in it's at the end of

2130
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,600
the thing because it's the the

2131
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,280
so we improved the document a little bit

2132
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,719
one of the things we did is we put an

2133
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:56,880
extra level in the in the mesh so it's

2134
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,800
clear that it's a multi-hop and that not

2135
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,120
every device is directly connected to

2136
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,679
the registrar

2137
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:05,280
uh

2138
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,760
i keep getting a hiccup when i look at

2139
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,040
the diagram because i want to put the

2140
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,719
pledge on the left and the registrar on

2141
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:12,880
the right but the other authors liked it

2142
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,320
this way so

2143
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,480
whatever um the important thing is that

2144
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,040
the last hop is probably clear

2145
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,040
uh and because it's not the the device

2146
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,440
is not yet part of the network

2147
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,960
next slide please

2148
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,000
oh we made it nicer looking with the a

2149
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,040
the conversion to svg

2150
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,280
okay so

2151
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,960
we had in the document that a joined

2152
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,440
proxy may implement both

2153
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,600
with no mandatory to implement for the

2154
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,960
joint proxy

2155
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,840
um it now says the joint proxy must must

2156
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,080
implement both i don't know exactly how

2157
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,440
that happened

2158
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,199
um

2159
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,280
it's not what i would have written um i

2160
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,120
i believe it happened as a kind of

2161
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,120
frustrated response to reviewers

2162
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,639
comments about not quite understanding

2163
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,159
what's going on

2164
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:01,199
um so i made this table

2165
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:02,560
and i'm sorry it doesn't quite fit on

2166
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,760
the the slide um

2167
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,040
so what does it amount to um i think

2168
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,080
that

2169
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,400
all registrars have to support stateful

2170
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,360
onboarding for the simple reason that

2171
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,679
um if you're going to make a co-op dtls

2172
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:19,520
connection it is a stateful

2173
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,400
activity and you have to a registrar has

2174
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,239
to support state for that there's no

2175
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:25,760
other way about it

2176
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,440
so the registrar's always going to

2177
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,560
support that

2178
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,719
always going to announce it

2179
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,159
and

2180
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,560
that's a a simple first step that's

2181
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,920
mandatory

2182
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,239
a joint proxy that

2183
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,400
implemented a stateful onboarding

2184
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,320
process that is it uses ram to keep

2185
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,080
track of what's going on

2186
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,159
uh would see that announcement and would

2187
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,560
say of course i can operate in that way

2188
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,719
and would go

2189
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,120
um if a registrar does support the

2190
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,280
stateless method that's in this

2191
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,560
jpy thing then it would announce it

2192
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,360
and

2193
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,760
the joint proxy that supported it might

2194
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,760
prefer to do that rather than the

2195
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,560
stateful one if it prefers to

2196
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,000
use uh to prefers to use network to

2197
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,239
store the state rather than

2198
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,199
um

2199
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:16,239
ram and that's not necessarily a pr uh

2200
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:18,960
all every device there in particular if

2201
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,960
you're not battery operated but you do

2202
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:21,760
have

2203
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,480
uh and you have lots of ram

2204
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,199
then and your network's very poor

2205
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,520
then stateful might be a better choice

2206
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,920
you know it's it depends

2207
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,080
i would rather not say that

2208
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,080
either are mandatory

2209
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,000
um i would like to tell people if you

2210
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,880
buy a registrar and it doesn't support

2211
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,760
stateless and you buy join proxies that

2212
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,400
don't uh sorry that

2213
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,719
a registrar that does not

2214
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,960
um do stateless yes and you buy joint

2215
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,600
proxies that only do stateless

2216
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,679
then it's not going to work

2217
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,440
so i don't i would say that it's not an

2218
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,120
interoperability failure that is a

2219
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,600
procurement failure in my opinion the

2220
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,159
the interoperability failure would be is

2221
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,280
if

2222
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,760
the registrar did support stateless

2223
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,800
and the

2224
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,040
joint proxies did support stateless but

2225
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,679
they failed to negotiate that in in in

2226
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:16,000
real life right i mean it similarly if i

2227
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,880
buy a if i buy a cisco router with uh

2228
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,920
short haul optics and i buy a juniper

2229
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:27,280
router with only copper connections it

2230
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,280
also doesn't interoperate despite the

2231
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,960
fact that everyone else has got a thing

2232
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,639
you've got the wrong plugs so this i

2233
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,920
think is a wrong plug situation but

2234
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,320
i would love to have more uh comments on

2235
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,560
the list i don't i just don't think that

2236
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,280
we really want to tell every join proxy

2237
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,920
entity that you must implement both or

2238
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,280
that you must implement one or you must

2239
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,639
build the other because i really think

2240
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,880
it depends upon what what your target

2241
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,239
environment is

2242
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:53,920
what we should have is we should have

2243
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,920
whatever you have implemented it should

2244
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,920
automatically configure and find the

2245
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,760
thing that works

2246
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,000
can i add to your myrand rant

2247
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,320
so which is about security

2248
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,120
um we have been i think in pretty much

2249
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,639
every itf spec pretty bad about defining

2250
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:14,159
really actionable um state overload

2251
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:16,320
protection so it from the security

2252
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,719
perspective the state list is so much

2253
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,560
easier right we don't have to specify

2254
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,400
anything because there is really no

2255
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,800
problem of doing the security and state

2256
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,560
overload control on the registrar it's a

2257
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,239
big box it can easily get software

2258
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:30,800
updates but uh on the proxies uh that's

2259
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,800
that's a lot harder if we do stateful on

2260
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,280
the box uh if you if if the working

2261
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,679
group and you are telling me that we

2262
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:39,600
should make stateless mandatory to

2263
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,880
implement

2264
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:41,679
then

2265
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:43,440
i actually don't have a problem with

2266
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,600
that okay i'm just bringing just the

2267
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,120
security thing to do to the table as one

2268
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,360
that will typically only run into in the

2269
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,719
end of the process in isg and put it out

2270
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,400
for consideration i don't want to make

2271
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,120
any you know judgment calls right now so

2272
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,520
so so i would agree with you that would

2273
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,600
go with it there there there are some

2274
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,880
some

2275
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,159
there are some there are different

2276
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:10,080
attacks in that case and i i'm happy to

2277
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,600
to go through them

2278
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,880
and put it in the security

2279
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:16,159
considerations um but i think um at

2280
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,679
least the authors we need some more

2281
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:20,400
clear guidance as to what to do here um

2282
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,360
i would prefer to leave it open but i'm

2283
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,840
i'll go with whatever anyone wants

2284
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,560
you're going to speak from the mic

2285
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,920
oh you're going to

2286
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,239
you're going to fix something else okay

2287
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:33,520
this is the problem when you have your

2288
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,960
ad to your id support

2289
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:40,960
robots wilson cisco so

2290
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,639
i'm not sure i feel that strongly on

2291
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,080
this i mean obviously raised a comment

2292
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,320
during my review i think it was simply

2293
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,880
the the observation that if there's a

2294
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,880
sort of minimum common denominator that

2295
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,639
all these things support that obviously

2296
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,560
makes interrupt easier that you know

2297
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,159
that you've if somebody doesn't know

2298
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:57,280
exactly what they're doing i know this

2299
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,719
is probably not plausible in this

2300
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,719
deployment scenario if they get one of

2301
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:02,000
these and one of those they're going to

2302
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,080
at least talk something rather

2303
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,560
absolutely take so that's all it's from

2304
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,719
i can understand that

2305
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:10,719
in the different scenarios maybe

2306
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,400
one's a lot more optimal than the other

2307
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,560
and hence it's hard to say always do

2308
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,560
stateless always do stay full

2309
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,960
i would

2310
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,199
see like they also have to agree on the

2311
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:23,040
radio

2312
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,800
right you can't you can't interrupt your

2313
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,440
15-4 in a 802-11

2314
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,719
right and and so you know at that level

2315
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,360
you might say all the 15.4 devices ought

2316
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,120
to support stateless

2317
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,600
well that's awesome okay yes right okay

2318
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,920
and it and and it's perfectly fine if

2319
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:40,960
the the

2320
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,600
wi-fi ones just don't because you know

2321
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,600
what the network's so big who cares on

2322
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,360
the other hand the network's so big

2323
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,600
it's easy to fit all the state in it

2324
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,199
right there's no there's no issue about

2325
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:53,520
extra extra big you know more packets

2326
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,440
because you can easily fit in 1500 bytes

2327
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,639
the whole state

2328
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:57,440
so

2329
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,679
you know i think anything where you can

2330
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:02,080
sort of constrain down the minimum

2331
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,320
options i think that personally it feels

2332
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,560
to me that improves interoperability yes

2333
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,360
i i agree so you know i mean mandatory

2334
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,040
to implement does not mean mandatory to

2335
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,400
use

2336
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,159
but then you have the question of okay

2337
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:16,840
so i if i implement both which one do i

2338
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,639
prefer

2339
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,000
and you have different devices

2340
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,520
preferring different things then you get

2341
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,360
weirdness right

2342
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,520
where you know on this side of the room

2343
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,600
you can you you get really efficient

2344
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,120
onboarding on that side of the room you

2345
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,040
get a different joint proxy and you know

2346
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,760
something works differently right so um

2347
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,320
so that's why i'm like i don't know

2348
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,440
right but

2349
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,199
um

2350
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:41,920
i guess i'm happy to write anything

2351
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,040
okay

2352
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,119
um if the implementation experience for

2353
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,679
example shows that the stateless isn't

2354
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:50,480
even significantly more difficult to

2355
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,400
implement then we know it has the

2356
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,960
security benefits so those two pieces

2357
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,199
together might be you know to make that

2358
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,199
the mti

2359
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:02,639
sure let's let's write that down then

2360
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,159
but i mean that's that's basically the

2361
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:06,480
implementation judgment call right

2362
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,000
because i mean i was i was looking at

2363
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,199
from the simple i'm writing an

2364
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,040
application on top of a

2365
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:14,080
uh tcp socket right so the the stateless

2366
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,760
stuff was difficult in the

2367
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,440
non-constraint case now in the

2368
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:18,800
constraint case

2369
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,800
might be turning opposite with you know

2370
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,760
dtls and everything so if you if you can

2371
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,280
make the judgment call that the um

2372
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,679
that the stateless approach is

2373
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:30,880
equivalent

2374
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,000
or even better in terms of

2375
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,679
implementation and we have the security

2376
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:36,880
benefits those two together but okay

2377
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,320
i i'm okay i'm okay with that um uh i'm

2378
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,239
okay with that um it's a it's an

2379
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,000
additional piece on the registrar that

2380
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,560
we're mandating must exist

2381
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,320
and um

2382
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,560
but you know i'm actually okay to say

2383
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,719
that to say it that way i prefer the

2384
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:56,639
stateless way myself okay um because i i

2385
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,960
i really think that it's much better to

2386
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,080
do that for the the low power devices uh

2387
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,920
for that they don't need ram

2388
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,639
particularly um for that and they can

2389
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:07,520
just

2390
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,679
you know just go and let someone else

2391
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:12,000
take care of the general service attack

2392
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,320
and he's flying isn't the registrar like

2393
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,639
a bigger box anyway so there's a bigger

2394
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,639
box so

2395
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,280
in the home it might be the bigger home

2396
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,920
router yeah okay but in an enterprise

2397
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,719
it's probably in a cabinet in a one you

2398
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:29,679
case or a vm yeah right

2399
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:31,600
but are those two cases i wouldn't

2400
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,880
thought we had to support both of these

2401
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,480
makes sense yeah it's not that much

2402
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,800
better but whereas the joint proxy you

2403
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,119
know it literally may be light bulb yeah

2404
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:41,679
right light bulbs have power so they

2405
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,600
could just join proxies

2406
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,800
right at least when they're switched on

2407
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,920
they have power

2408
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,679
but you won't get a security software

2409
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:49,440
upgrade on them

2410
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,840
that's

2411
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,440
true those guys are actually i think

2412
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:51,919
that's not

2413
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,199
among the best but

2414
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,360
anyway let's go on yeah okay sorry about

2415
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,839
next slide

2416
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:02,400
next slide

2417
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,280
okay

2418
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,440
so um

2419
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,639
we uh throughout our old jpy message um

2420
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:10,960
this is a some ways a very big change at

2421
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,880
this late stage

2422
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,960
um but all the people implementing were

2423
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,960
are basically authors at this point so

2424
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:19,119
they're all very happy to do this um

2425
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:20,320
basically we said it's none of your

2426
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,040
business what we put in the jpy message

2427
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:28,000
um and uh it's just some context um and

2428
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,080
uh in the document we suggest what you

2429
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,400
should put in it and that it's less than

2430
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,280
16 bytes and you can aes

2431
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,199
cbc encrypt it

2432
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:41,119
and that authenticates it nicely um

2433
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,840
and you know you can change the keys

2434
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,440
at your whim

2435
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,480
okay

2436
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,960
with some caveats about how to do this

2437
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,800
it also makes it much much much closer

2438
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,320
to how it works uh with rfc 90

2439
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,239
32

2440
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:59,119
or 31. it's one of those two uh which is

2441
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:01,600
the six dish uh minimal security

2442
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,000
onboarding that uses the co-app extended

2443
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,960
token in almost exactly the same way and

2444
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,880
you could and it has exactly the same

2445
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,719
problem and the same things and that's

2446
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,400
what we did so

2447
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,920
you could actually use the same code if

2448
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,600
you were implementing both on the same

2449
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,639
machine

2450
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:19,760
um so that's uh really it this is i the

2451
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,520
working group really needs to look at

2452
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,719
this because this is a change in the

2453
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:24,400
wire you know

2454
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,119
bits on the wire change

2455
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:29,040
why are on the bits change

2456
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:32,400
and so please read this and object now

2457
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,880
next next uh

2458
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,000
or a proof

2459
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,080
or proof yeah

2460
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,480
um okay this is the part where we get

2461
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,360
kind of

2462
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,600
icky um

2463
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,679
so when we're doing co-op discovery um

2464
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,679
if you were just looking for

2465
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:50,480
an

2466
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,000
an est

2467
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,239
uh or co-app in uh rfc 80 9148 i think

2468
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:57,199
it is

2469
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:59,840
uh recently published um you know you

2470
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,119
would do something on the left in the

2471
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:03,840
green okay um in particular you would do

2472
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,360
a multi-cast

2473
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,840
you know request tell me all the est

2474
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,239
servers and you get this response back

2475
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:11,840
that says oh they're here and they have

2476
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,440
this different content types and you can

2477
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,199
do these different things i actually

2478
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,800
think that's wrong because i think that

2479
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,480
it actually should have a co-app s at

2480
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,400
the front and i don't think you could

2481
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,920
multicast co-op discovery over dtls

2482
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:24,840
um

2483
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,800
but um

2484
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,040
anyway so on the right we've done the

2485
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,159
same thing

2486
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:31,600
in this case

2487
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,679
there happens to be a stateless

2488
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:35,920
registrar available

2489
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,600
and so he responds and it turns out

2490
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,760
according to the link formatting rules

2491
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,760
as far as we understand them

2492
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,800
going back to some 3000 um

2493
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,239
rfc 3000-ish rfc for some details about

2494
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:50,159
what the authority is if you want to

2495
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:51,760
stick a port number in you have to put

2496
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,080
the ip address and if it's a v6 address

2497
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,920
you have to put parenthesis or square

2498
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,600
brackets around it

2499
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,560
okay so that's the first one so 7434

2500
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:04,000
that's the stateless port number

2501
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,920
what's the scheme well we wrote coap as

2502
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,159
it's not coap s

2503
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:13,119
it's this thing of coap over dtls

2504
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:15,920
and then this gpy header and then udp

2505
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,760
and then ipv6

2506
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,920
so you can't go naively show up and

2507
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,000
start speaking co-app to it it won't

2508
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,880
work

2509
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,760
you have to have the jpy header

2510
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,280
so what are the solutions i don't think

2511
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,800
that's the next slide but i was going to

2512
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,719
make it the next slide see what the next

2513
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:31,760
slide is

2514
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,080
you want to see the next slide yeah

2515
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,840
yeah oh yeah there we go this is the

2516
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,679
option so the first first option is

2517
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:41,119
what's the issue i don't see an issue

2518
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:43,280
no that's that's it right

2519
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,280
the second one is we can create some new

2520
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,000
scheme jpy and we wondered

2521
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,400
what the overhead of doing that is how

2522
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,199
many

2523
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:54,159
how many reviews and external experts do

2524
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:56,000
we need to make that happen

2525
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,360
and we started looking through a list of

2526
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,800
uh schemes and we thought well maybe

2527
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,080
it's not as hard as we think because

2528
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,520
there's like all sorts of garbage in

2529
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,320
there

2530
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:05,360
um so you know what if someone says

2531
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,719
that's the right way then i guess we

2532
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,159
could go that way

2533
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,639
uh we could abuse some other scheme i

2534
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:11,679
guess

2535
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,400
uh but which one i don't know um

2536
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,280
uh it would be abuse um we could just

2537
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,679
not use co-op discovery for this case

2538
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,280
okay

2539
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,159
um

2540
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,719
or some other idea your other brilliant

2541
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:27,040
idea so this is where i'm really

2542
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,639
really would like a lot of discussion

2543
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:32,880
and i know no carsten has an opinion

2544
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,600
one concern of myself i just couldn't

2545
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,159
find you know good recipes on how to do

2546
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:42,480
this in in the rfcs right so well

2547
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,560
nobody's done exactly this before so

2548
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,360
maybe

2549
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,119
i i don't i don't know when is actually

2550
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,199
the the internet isn't working um so

2551
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:51,119
when when is actually the co-op working

2552
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:52,960
group right if they have five minutes

2553
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:54,719
time maybe we can even bring it up there

2554
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,320
right take it to the original well we we

2555
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,199
have we have the we have the the carson

2556
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:02,320
is is the uh expert reviewer for

2557
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,440
um

2558
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,639
um

2559
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:06,639
some part of this um

2560
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,320
and uh

2561
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,800
you know so to a certain extent if he

2562
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,719
thinks it's okay then it's okay

2563
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:15,360
um and it's the expert reviewer for the

2564
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,520
the name of the ski of the of the thing

2565
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:18,880
we're looking up

2566
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,080
um

2567
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,600
but you know i said there's like uh

2568
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,040
there's other ways there's other ways

2569
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,040
through this process um

2570
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,639
and as i said one of the issues is maybe

2571
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,400
there is no issue ultimately we're doing

2572
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,119
co-op s it's just we have a shim layer

2573
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:32,639
in front of it and you have to know

2574
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:34,719
about this and it's not said anywhere

2575
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:37,760
so that's one answer

2576
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,920
opinions from the internet

2577
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,880
and from the room please

2578
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,480
they would not understand the question i

2579
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,159
think was the other other question i

2580
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:48,559
should ask

2581
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,080
we'll go back to the previous line uh

2582
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,040
yeah

2583
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,480
please rob go ahead um so rob my

2584
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,080
instinct is to try and create new scheme

2585
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:58,880
here

2586
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,560
because i i don't think it's that hard

2587
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,800
to do so that would be my

2588
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,480
my first step to try would be because it

2589
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,840
feels like that's the right thing to do

2590
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:06,880
and that's well defined what this

2591
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,080
behavior is

2592
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,560
i think pretending it's not an issue

2593
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,000
is a bit icky

2594
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,679
because it's not going to work if you

2595
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,040
you know had a server that wasn't

2596
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,400
expecting this it's just going to not

2597
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,800
talk so we're not we're not really ever

2598
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,080
going to use this

2599
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,400
mechanism anywhere else

2600
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,119
i don't think right

2601
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:28,000
um maybe someone else has another

2602
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,719
stateless co-op ish thing that they need

2603
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,560
to do with dtls

2604
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,719
but i can't imagine what it is but it

2605
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:36,880
could come along but that's my concern

2606
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:39,440
is this is a single-use scheme

2607
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,960
can i just say from the process

2608
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,639
perspective i would like to understand

2609
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:44,400
first what you know

2610
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,960
somebody who best reads our rfc would

2611
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,719
figure out is the recommended way from

2612
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:50,639
the rfcs i couldn't do that i couldn't

2613
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,719
figure out what the recommended way is

2614
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:54,639
if that recommended way it turns out to

2615
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,800
be you know crappy lot of overhead and

2616
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,280
we can come up with an okay way that

2617
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,199
that's just a fallback right but how do

2618
01:44:01,199 --> 01:44:03,040
we figure out what the recommended way

2619
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,639
is

2620
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:06,560
i don't i don't get your question

2621
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,199
the the encoding right whether you know

2622
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,040
using a particular scheme

2623
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,119
right um having for this thing the port

2624
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:14,560
number all the all these things what is

2625
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,320
the recommended way to encode our

2626
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,639
information we're making it up as we go

2627
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:20,800
we're reading the rfcs we think but we

2628
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,920
feel you know unsafe about it so

2629
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,520
is the expert reviewer the one that

2630
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,760
should give us the guidance is the

2631
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,159
working group for that wrote the rfcs uh

2632
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:32,080
the one that should give us the guidance

2633
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:34,159
that's that's my process question i

2634
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:35,920
think i'll ask ask

2635
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:38,239
i don't know which ads it goes to art

2636
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:41,119
area probably yeah probably

2637
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:42,800
right so i mean let's let's just figure

2638
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:43,840
out in the first place what the

2639
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,280
recommended way is to encode the

2640
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,199
information that we need to carry

2641
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:49,600
and then go from there if if there if we

2642
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,960
can walk through the process doing the

2643
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,480
recommended way then let's do that

2644
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:56,480
otherwise find the work around kirsten

2645
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:58,880
yeah i'm having a hard time

2646
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,320
understanding the problem here um so the

2647
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,800
the thing is that between these angle

2648
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,520
brackets you have to have a link

2649
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,320
and um

2650
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,719
there are many ways to build a link

2651
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,080
um but in the end it needs to be a link

2652
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,520
and if you

2653
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,199
have a

2654
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:22,159
special kind of plumbing

2655
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:22,960
uh

2656
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:24,560
that you are using

2657
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,280
um a long time ago we had the discussion

2658
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,600
about rfc

2659
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,360
8232 32 or 83

2660
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:32,719
23

2661
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:35,679
um whether uh the the

2662
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:37,679
best way would be to

2663
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:40,400
to essentially do the http thing and and

2664
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:43,760
completely ignore the plumbing

2665
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:44,719
or

2666
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:46,080
actually

2667
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:49,440
do schemes that are plumbing specific

2668
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,760
and we decided to go for plumbing

2669
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:52,880
specific

2670
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,600
schemes with the the

2671
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,960
intention

2672
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,239
to at some point invent something that

2673
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:03,119
that makes life easier for us

2674
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:06,400
now that was five years ago and we this

2675
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,400
invention hasn't happened yet

2676
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,199
um so i think right now the state of the

2677
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:14,639
art is that you come up with a scheme

2678
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:17,840
um describe what it does

2679
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,920
and and put it there

2680
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,199
okay

2681
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:23,519
thank you

2682
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,360
and i i got drawn into this because i'm

2683
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,600
i'm supposed to

2684
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,320
give a um destiny an expert opinion on

2685
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,080
the rt

2686
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,520
uh part

2687
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,639
which i think that there is no

2688
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:40,560
no discussion about the rt part that

2689
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:41,840
that's fine

2690
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,520
um but the the example with which it's

2691
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,080
introduced that that doesn't work

2692
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,520
right now and

2693
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,119
that kind of

2694
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:54,560
taints the the irt registration

2695
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,320
that we definitely want to go forward

2696
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,719
with as quickly as possible

2697
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:00,639
okay so so we're going to go find the

2698
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:01,520
scheme

2699
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:04,080
figure out how to register register that

2700
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,719
and what's involved and

2701
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:08,320
get back to the working group in a

2702
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:09,520
couple of weeks

2703
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,040
i think there'll be vacations in the way

2704
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,320
but we'll get back to the working group

2705
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,320
in a couple weeks and i hope we can do

2706
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:15,520
that quickly

2707
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,880
any other comments because i'd like to

2708
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,880
go on to another document

2709
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,880
just 30 minutes

2710
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,480
quickly um

2711
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:23,600
from a

2712
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,600
systematics point of view

2713
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,639
the place that defines jpy should also

2714
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:32,400
be the place that defines the scheme

2715
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,040
yes so we should put it in our document

2716
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,679
yes yes i agree with you completely it

2717
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:39,199
just needs to be there they need to know

2718
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:42,400
that they need to put this there

2719
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:45,199
okay i'm trying to take that down

2720
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:47,119
thing sir carson that there was a lot

2721
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:48,239
more

2722
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:50,159
that we got to then on the on the mail

2723
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:51,199
exchanges

2724
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:52,719
what's the last is that the last there

2725
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:54,320
might be one more slide

2726
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,840
uh just questions oh that one no we

2727
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:59,600
couldn't live without that yes okay

2728
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,040
and i think formally it's coming back to

2729
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,560
the working group rob for a second

2730
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,639
working group last call right

2731
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:06,320
and given how we're moving you know a

2732
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:09,600
lot of text around from from the um

2733
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,159
voucher i think it doesn't make sense to

2734
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:14,159
try to progress any of these documents

2735
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:15,440
individually

2736
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:16,880
right because they're so much tied

2737
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:19,280
together so we should kind of try to run

2738
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,199
them in parallel

2739
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:22,960
right okay

2740
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,400
i was just going to quickly i posted

2741
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,639
into the chat the answer got back from

2742
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:30,320
ayanna so i put a question to

2743
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,880
i put a question into um

2744
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,199
the ice g and i and i on his honor that

2745
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:37,040
as well so and they gave the answer so

2746
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,480
it's in the chat effect the thing is he

2747
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,679
don't think it's that hard his expert

2748
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:41,360
review needs to be discussed in the

2749
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,880
mailing list but don't

2750
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,440
i don't think it's that arduous

2751
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,600
i think we try to accelerate the the

2752
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:50,400
voucher stuff and i i'm just fearful

2753
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,639
that the stuff then goes down a pro

2754
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:54,400
process where you know we're still

2755
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,320
working on the proxy and we would still

2756
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,320
like to do changes over in the voucher

2757
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,320
because of it so let's try to keep them

2758
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,440
parallel that makes sense too

2759
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,119
okay so you want to pull up the other

2760
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:07,280
yeah other um this is a completely

2761
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:08,639
different document

2762
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:10,719
okay yeah you can have all my time so i

2763
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:12,080
may not

2764
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,560
just i think i'm the last am i not no i

2765
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:16,639
i i still wanted to promote my you know

2766
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:18,639
grasp dns stuff but we can skip that

2767
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:19,840
okay i'm sorry that's always trying to

2768
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,840
rush because i knew i didn't no no i i

2769
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,480
i'm saying it's it's fine i'm just uh

2770
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,520
which one

2771
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:26,840
is it now

2772
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:31,119
proxy eep to connect now yeah eap

2773
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:33,360
all right the word eap in it eip to

2774
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:35,280
connect okay for onboarding let's take

2775
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,520
that one then

2776
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,159
okay so um there's a dot this is a

2777
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:42,560
document but basically about how do we

2778
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:45,440
manage to run brewski with wi-fi

2779
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,639
um so there were efforts in the emu area

2780
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:51,520
to do uh brewski teep

2781
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,840
um so one of the problems is that teep

2782
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,440
is not really deployed out there it's

2783
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,040
not really out there

2784
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,760
doing brewski t might be neat but

2785
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,119
doesn't really get anywhere anywhere

2786
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:02,560
anybody anywhere

2787
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,360
so

2788
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,119
al and i wrote this document about how

2789
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:09,799
to do it next slide please

2790
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:13,199
so basically what we do

2791
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:17,520
is you do an eap tls and you use a

2792
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,480
network

2793
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,840
identifier of onboarding at eap.rpa

2794
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:25,679
and uh you uh don't verify the server

2795
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:28,000
and uh you get put on a network where

2796
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
you're probably very lonely

2797
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,360
and you might not even get dhcp v4

2798
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,800
and that's okay because brewski doesn't

2799
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,239
need that

2800
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:39,360
um but you're encrypted um and you wind

2801
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,840
up in a in a captive portal of some kind

2802
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,360
um you might get all these other you

2803
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,080
know v4 things and have a captive portal

2804
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:47,599
and you might be able to you know

2805
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:49,760
download windows updates and a lot of

2806
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:52,239
enterprises have that network already

2807
01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:54,880
okay it's it's it's what happens to you

2808
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:57,679
if you fail the i'm running the latest

2809
01:50:57,679 --> 01:50:59,920
um virus scanner stuff

2810
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,760
and um

2811
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,599
that's all we need we just need you to

2812
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:05,040
be on the right network so that we can

2813
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,280
then run grasp find out where the join

2814
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:10,400
proxy is and do the rest okay that's

2815
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,560
really it okay

2816
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,639
the argument against this kind of thing

2817
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:16,159
has always been

2818
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:18,080
that

2819
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:20,239
ssids are expensive and we can't just

2820
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:23,199
set up our own especially in enterprises

2821
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:24,480
we can't just set up our own for

2822
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,159
onboarding

2823
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:28,560
and the realization was that we already

2824
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,400
have it it's a captive portal network

2825
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,400
and the enterprises already have it

2826
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,639
it's it's not a clear text network which

2827
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:36,639
is what i'd originally imagined

2828
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:39,679
um and um you do it this way and it's we

2829
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:41,360
don't have any definition that says how

2830
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:44,159
do you do eep tls without client

2831
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:45,599
authentication

2832
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:47,040
and so

2833
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:48,560
that's basically what we're going to do

2834
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,119
it's a missing it's a missing slot we

2835
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:53,840
can fit this into this slot and we think

2836
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,080
it works

2837
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,239
uh next slide please it's really very

2838
01:51:58,239 --> 01:52:00,559
simple

2839
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,760
um as i said there's the question of do

2840
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,159
you authenticate in eap the server and

2841
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:10,080
brewski would say no

2842
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,000
it's provisional provisional you'll do

2843
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,520
it later

2844
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:16,000
on the other hand if it comes arrives at

2845
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,119
a device that has a ca trust store

2846
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:20,880
and it can authenticate it it could

2847
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:23,520
authenticate it that would be fine

2848
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,599
there's an additional piece of work

2849
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:26,800
um

2850
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,960
which is how do i know which network to

2851
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,560
join there could be many of them

2852
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,480
and in some sense that is an 80211u

2853
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:37,679
problem

2854
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:39,520
and i'm not even sure we can do that

2855
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,679
work in the ietf but we do have a

2856
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:43,520
suggested solution

2857
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,040
for that

2858
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,560
um for that

2859
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,480
uh this work probably probably next

2860
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:51,280
slide this work probably belongs

2861
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:52,880
um

2862
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,280
in emu

2863
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:56,960
but i don't think it's worth taking it

2864
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:59,040
to mu unless this working group has a

2865
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,719
clear notion that this is the direction

2866
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:02,080
we want to go

2867
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:04,000
okay at which point it becomes we can

2868
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,119
argue over who gets the document

2869
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:08,320
um

2870
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:09,679
and that's about it there's several

2871
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:11,360
other entities doing something very

2872
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,760
specific very similar

2873
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,119
in different ways

2874
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:16,000
um

2875
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,320
and that captive portal network could be

2876
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:19,520
used for

2877
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,679
all sorts of things right it can be used

2878
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:24,800
as a captive portal literally okay

2879
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,360
where you actually go to a web website

2880
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,480
and actually you know put in your hotel

2881
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:33,119
room number and last name and

2882
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,880
uh get access to the internet if it's

2883
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,639
your laptop so that that would be

2884
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:38,880
reusable but on your you know you can

2885
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,960
imagine even in this hotel you could do

2886
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:41,760
that

2887
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:44,800
and your iot device could onboard you

2888
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,719
know whatever your pacemaker or

2889
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:49,520
something that you have you have

2890
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:52,719
alan you want to say something

2891
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:55,599
yeah um

2892
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:58,159
one of the other pushes for

2893
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:00,320
implementing this

2894
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,560
is um

2895
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,080
things like

2896
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,400
keep as you say people are pushing all

2897
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,719
kinds of stuff into e because it's just

2898
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:11,040
easier right so for anyone who's read

2899
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:14,000
rfc 7170 which defines cheap there's a

2900
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
whole pkcs7

2901
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,560
certificate provisioning thing there and

2902
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,040
as an implementer i'm

2903
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,480
sort of

2904
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:25,280
upset about just shove everything in to

2905
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,320
eat

2906
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,480
um and what we probably should have done

2907
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,920
10 years ago when this was originally

2908
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,920
published is just get people onto a

2909
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,480
network um so i've been talking about

2910
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:36,639
this this general concept

2911
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:39,599
in emu and other places for a while

2912
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:42,239
there's some positive support for it and

2913
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:45,840
some pushback but i think from a

2914
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:48,080
layering point of view

2915
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:50,400
we have no business doing anything in

2916
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:54,400
eep other than authentication and that's

2917
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,159
where this is going it just makes things

2918
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:57,760
easier if

2919
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:00,719
everything is ip for anything past the

2920
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:03,520
initial authentication

2921
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,520
and to be clear once you're on board and

2922
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,520
you get a certificate and a credential

2923
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,599
you come back and do eap tls again and

2924
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:11,199
get on the real network

2925
01:55:11,199 --> 01:55:14,880
okay um uh for that um but when you're

2926
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,560
doing it and you know we can have 10

2927
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:20,080
different onboarding mechanisms that and

2928
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:23,520
if they run over ip or panna or a whole

2929
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,360
bunch of other things whatever it is you

2930
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:26,400
want to do

2931
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:27,199
well

2932
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:29,520
it's just running over you've got you're

2933
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,760
getting an equivalent of a wired an

2934
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,280
untrusted wire

2935
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,800
and i think that's really valuable

2936
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,320
because i think it just brings us back

2937
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,920
as alan just said it brings us right

2938
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,360
back into

2939
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,920
we're running ip not this thing that

2940
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,159
fragments poorly over

2941
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:48,320
uh you know uh uh

2942
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,599
wireless frames and has no you know

2943
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:53,920
has no other controls or visibility or

2944
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:56,880
debug ability or that kind of stuff

2945
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,800
so sorry you lost me somewhere before

2946
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:02,320
slide one so there is a well-known ssid

2947
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,880
for a captive portal that no no no what

2948
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,159
there is is there is a way for the

2949
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:10,080
the um

2950
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:13,040
access point to announce the list of

2951
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,040
realms that it supports

2952
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:17,599
okay okay and so the new realm that it's

2953
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:21,760
going to support is eap dot arpa

2954
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,199
and it can already do that that's

2955
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:27,119
already in the spec in 802 uh 11u

2956
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:29,840
okay okay so you add eap dot arpa to the

2957
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,840
list of things that this particular

2958
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,440
channel supports

2959
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,760
and the client says aha i found one that

2960
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,320
i can onboard on it uses the user id

2961
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,719
onboarding at eep arpa and continues

2962
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:43,840
alan did i get that right

2963
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,320
uh yes so this is

2964
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:49,760
what one thing we're doing here is

2965
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:54,320
defining what 5216 missed 5216 allowed

2966
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:58,000
for unauthenticated eeptls

2967
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,840
but offers nothing further so all these

2968
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:02,960
stos did magical things themselves um so

2969
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,400
we just defined something here which

2970
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:07,679
should be much much simpler

2971
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:11,360
okay so we're latching on to that 5216

2972
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:14,159
to create a new announcement

2973
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:16,719
using for example a pre-existing ssid

2974
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:18,080
which is different but which will be

2975
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:21,119
learned through this mechanism yep

2976
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:23,520
okay and then from there on we just try

2977
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:25,280
to use standard brewski constraint

2978
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,360
brewski exactly

2979
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,040
yeah

2980
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:29,840
okay

2981
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:32,400
or or something else that you know

2982
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,719
someone invents next year

2983
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:36,560
how difficult is it to to build a

2984
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,560
working proof of concept from that is is

2985
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,239
this i think al and i might have

2986
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:42,880
something by the next day yeah oh would

2987
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:44,560
be cool yeah okay

2988
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,239
yeah it's it's on the back the room

2989
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:47,920
might even see it

2990
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:50,080
it's pretty pretty simple to do it's

2991
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:53,119
just certificates on the server side

2992
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:54,560
maybe maybe not

2993
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:57,280
and updating client-side behavior to

2994
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:01,280
treat eep. as special

2995
01:58:02,239 --> 01:58:04,400
okay

2996
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:08,239
so discussion on the list please

2997
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,520
yep all right sounds cool thank you very

2998
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,199
much

2999
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,280
okay i'm going to skip my marketing

3000
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:18,239
material for uh the grasp dns stuff and

3001
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:21,360
take it to the list and i think

3002
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:23,119
we've reached another two full hours

3003
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:26,080
again thank you very much everybody

3004
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:31,040
and yeah hopefully see you all in london

3005
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:36,960
and this meeting is officially closed

3006
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,360
thank you all

3007
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:42,719
hopefully see you in london

3008
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,800
bye-bye

3009
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:50,960
yeah you know what the problem is

3010
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:53,040
i'm using the simple thing which is just

3011
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,280
two wires and actually for this hum i

3012
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:57,119
would need three wires then it actually

3013
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:58,480
is without hum

3014
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,320
but you know then i don't have the uk

3015
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:04,080
cable any cable the us cable because

3016
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,000
i have all three of them they're way too

3017
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
big

3018
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:18,880
yeah but i mean it's it's i think it's

3019
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,520
always very very nice just the cable for

3020
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:24,400
the continent right

3021
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:27,638
now yes

3022
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,960
it already
