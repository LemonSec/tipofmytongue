you can go through this very quickly so

13
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,679

um

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,000
here's an agenda so we have um basically

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,320
um discussion of some working group last

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,680
call drafts

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,960
and also they're like some proponents

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,320
wanting to recharge the working group

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,399
really want to focus on the energy of

24
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,040
the group and also the expertise we have

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,719
to do the work we want to do

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,878
here's the working group draft status we

27
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,720
have three drafts

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,920
is finish the iesg review right so they

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,840
are on the status of

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,360
our

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,640
ifc red eq but we still miss the wrath

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,959
because we have some normative reference

33
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,879
which are now ready so using the first

34
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,599
thing on your screen yeah it's kind of

35
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,840
annoying in a way i heard people have

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,239
waited years for them to

37
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,120
finish

38
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
and so we have um a couple of drafts

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,800
need to be uh discussed whether we

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,760
should

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,400
finish the last call sent to iesg for

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,319
review or should we

43
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,720
abandon it so i hope this meeting we can

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,560
discuss them

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,599
um

46
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,640
that's it and then so let's go back to

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,760
the

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,680
um any other questions

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,519
want a suggestion any discussion no

50
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,000
then let's go to this

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,239
first thing on the agenda

52
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,360
about the consumer interface um

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,920
data model okay so can i tackle during

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
my speaking is it fine i think

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,200
if i okay otherwise it didn't hurt yeah

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,480

so first of all i briefly report um

66
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,840
consumer pacing interface and

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,560
restoration interface young data model

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,959
so linda could you

69
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,239
okay open the slides

70
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,480
okay

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,040
so yeah i briefly have five minutes uh

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
so next slide please

73
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,439
the basically consumer patient interface

74
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,199
uh we got uh

75
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,399
the review

76
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,238
from

77
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,440
um

78
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,360
some china mobile

79
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,479
in ping

80
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,680
pengling

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
and zhang subak from e3

82
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,960
and also security directorate so

83
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
basically uh

84
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
this time we synchronize a

85
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
consumer-based interface the way the

86
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,639
other nsf pacing and capability young

87
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,800
model and monitoring

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
because we

89
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,520
passed through

90
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
uh three data young model

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
the thorough the

92
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
review and evaluation

93
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,800
of isc

94
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,520
in the meanwhile we also updated the in

95
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,080
parallel uh consumer phase interface and

96
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
the resurrection interfaces so we

97
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
believe uh

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
these two drafts are well synchronized

99
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
next slide please

100
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,440
so young penguin he

101
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
is a child mobile engineer so

102
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
he think

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,039
some

104
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,000
he raised some uh

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
ipl

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
licensing issue but uh i reserved with

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,160
my sku paid turned attorney so

108
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,400
now the consumer patient legislation

109
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,840
interface

110
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,360
the ipr

111
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,280
declared as this is the reality free so

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,000
anybody can use for free

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,720
so

114
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
i think this is cleared next slide

115
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,280
please

116
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
and yesterday uh dr johnson park from

117
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
actually uh he

118
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,199
gave several comments so i addressed her

119
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,440
last night and i

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,800
updated and i submitted the version 22 i

121
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,479
believe all

122
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,479
his comments are

123
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,520
cleared

124
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
okay next slide

125
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
those are editorial comments

126
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,600
and also uh security directorate he gave

127
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,639
he reviewed and overall looks of

128
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,680
i think is fine and then he gave one a

129
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,120
niche

130
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,919
typo so interruption so we collected

131
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,198
next slide please

132
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
the second uh young model is a

133
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,520
resurrection interface this is uh

134
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,280
importing um

135
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,759
capability young data model so

136
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,440
capability young data model is passed as

137
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,880
rfc so

138
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,080
this is

139
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,479
borrowing a major component from

140
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,840
capability

141
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,960
so the only uh some picture or isolation

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,840
is

143
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,680
some excess information and the

144
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
performance capability

145
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,240
young model are the separate one but

146
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,199
very short uh young data modules so i

147
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,319
think that

148
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,680
it should be okay

149
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,960
next slide please

150
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,120
so

151
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,720
the same uh libya uh young and penguin

152
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,800
mobile china uh he also revealed he

153
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,440
think it looks fine so

154
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,080
he doesn't have any objection for king

155
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,199
roblascore next slide

156
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,599
and also actually uh

157
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,479
mr ginger choi uh he

158
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,039
uh reviewed uh our draft

159
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,759
uh he addressed one a comment about the

160
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,800
access information so the previously uh

161
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,560
we had some

162
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
transport some

163
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
layer information but

164
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,560
and now

165
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,840
our young model focus on

166
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,360
the access in the the same data center

167
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
so in that case

168
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
ip address and

169
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,199
portal number enough because

170
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,319
this access information for some

171
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,039
security controller can access

172
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
network function nf

173
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,960
to computer so usually uh netcomp or

174
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,840
leicester conf are used so which means

175
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,440
the tcp is used so in bristol tsp is a

176
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
transporter layer so

177
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,720
as a result ip address and the proton

178
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,039
number for

179
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,840
on nsf is good enough so that's why we

180
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
removed some on redundant

181
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,958
text

182
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,159
next slide please

183
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,039
so also the scott uh security direct

184
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,920
uh told it so he's think

185
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
uh our

186
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
draft also already

187
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,200
and he doesn't have any objection but he

188
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,720
has some over some comment so he think

189
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,839
there is no issue about this document

190
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,040
next slide please

191
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,839
also

192
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,160
operations uh directorate uh

193
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,000
uh gian uh mishira uh she

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,519
or i think

195
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,120
a guy gave some comment uh so

196
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,480
he or she suggested some redundant

197
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
example xml so we removed

198
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
most of them but first example

199
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,360
is useful i believe so we just

200
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,880
keep it other

201
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,440
example external we removed the next

202
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,399
slide please

203
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,480
so next step

204
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,200
we

205
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,160
got

206
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,200
okay through a review from

207
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,120
people

208
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,560
outside the authors so i believe uh

209
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,200
also the one thing i want to say

210
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,080
uh last um

211
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,640
actually the hackathon is already almost

212
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,279
seven years during seven years

213
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,200
except the one hackathon because of

214
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
copied yeah

215
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,360
the happening at that time we couldn't

216
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
participate in itf hackathon except that

217
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
so we

218
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,399
kept

219
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,680
participating and

220
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,720
itunes hackathon we demonstrated also we

221
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
implement our own also we implemented

222
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,240
with uh at three people we so we had

223
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
have two implementations

224
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,360
and consumer pacing legislation

225
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,399
interface young model are well approved

226
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,440
through

227
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,920
last seven years hackathon

228
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,959
or not

229
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,720
seven years hackathon point of view

230
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
maybe at six years

231
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,360
so

232
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
low man i believe uh consumer-facing uh

233
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,440
legislation interview young model are

234
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,200
ready to go

235
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
okay

236
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
okay so do you have some comment

237
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,560
okay

238
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,399
hi roman genetic responsible

239
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,000
sec aad so uh just so just to clarify my

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,279
understanding you're saying consumer

241
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,880
facing and registration interface is

242
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,440
ready to exit the working group

243
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,160
oh is that is that what is that the uh

244
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,160
yeah ready for last call

245
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,279
so i guess i have a little bit of a

246
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,000
question i was cruising the mailing list

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
i'm trying to understand the

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,160
the degree of review for example with

249
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,320
the registration interface because i see

250
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,839
on the mailing list

251
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,880
one person commented on it

252
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,680
actually the uh penguin he also china

253
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,320
mobile he also uh slowly libya but he

254
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,240
couldn't find any uh

255
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,160
problems so oh yeah no and it's great

256
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,839
that he did i just didn't see anyone

257
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,120
else from the working group saying that

258
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,880
they read it and reviewed it i mean the

259
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,560
director reviews are great but we asked

260
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,000
for those that's coming from the outside

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
that's not working group energy

262
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,079
i mean is it possible to get more

263
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,600
reviewers i mean there's folks in this

264
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,880
room i mean are they committed to

265
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,399
reviewing it and saying it's ready to

266
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,600
publish that's what i'm looking for

267
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,040
yes yeah yeah i mean that's what i mean

268
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,079
we need the church i mean what i'm

269
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,000
looking for is the transparency that you

270
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,680
know folks have looked at it and kind of

271
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,120
read it and if we could do that for both

272
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,560
of those to get to the point that we

273
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,519
have

274
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,959
i mean this isn't a voting thing it's

275
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,160
not a numbers thing we could have three

276
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,760
to five independent people that aren't

277
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,200
document authors that aren't the direct

278
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,959
reviews that say i looked at it and even

279
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,240
if it's i don't have comments but i

280
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,600
looked at and reviewed it that would be

281
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
the strong signal i'd be looking for to

282
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,160
kind of exit working for a blast call

283
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,800
so you know the two young model already

284
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,200
seven years old so last

285
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,440
six years uh hackathon project during

286
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,800
hackathon project

287
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,120
people gave some comment as sujan

288
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,240
mentioned

289
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,120
so

290
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,279
i think also you know young model

291
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,600
isolation case you can see very short

292
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,680
young models so i think yeah there is no

293
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,360
problem yeah

294
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,279
yeah i mean i i mean sue and i kind of

295
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,560
talked about this since you kind of

296
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,680
mentioned her i mean i think we have a

297
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,880
little bit of uh

298
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
i'm trying to focus us on the process

299
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
because the hackathon is is wonderful

300
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,519
but the hackathon is not unfortunately

301
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,600
our document process so what we would

302
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,639
expect just to level set uh to level set

303
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,079
everyone from working for last call is

304
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,240
that we have a document there is an

305
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,079
author team one would expect that the

306
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,440
team of authors has been folding in

307
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,560
what's happening from the working group

308
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
and they've already done everything that

309
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,240
needs to get done what i think gives

310
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
working group the chairs confidence and

311
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
me confidence that

312
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,440
we this is a consensus-based thing that

313
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
the people that in the the people that

314
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,720
participate in the working group

315
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,000
put everything they needed in this

316
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,440
document would be for folks from the

317
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
working group to positively confirm to

318
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,040
us we looked at it we think it's ready

319
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,760
to go uh and you know it just and we

320
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,959
feel that there are kind of new issues

321
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,639
and so the hackathon thing is i guess

322
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,600
great

323
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,440
uh and it's wonderful i mean the many

324
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,720
years of participation has been an

325
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,639
exemplar of how to tie things in the

326
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,079
hackathon of the working group but we

327
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,920
need that experience rolled back into

328
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,680
the working group so we can see that so

329
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,880
if there are artifacts from the

330
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,320
hackathon where you're working for

331
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,760
participants or participating that's

332
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,000
great but i think again we need a

333
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,839
timeliness thing which is if it's

334
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,199
happening seven years ago that wasn't

335
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,040
the final document so what we need is

336
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,880
there's a final version of the document

337
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,560
and the working group has looked at it

338
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,320
and you know they want it you know they

339
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,880
endorse it continuing to publication

340
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,320
so you can see you know uh security uh

341
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
directorate and the operation

342
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,399
directorate they couldn't find any uh

343
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,440
problems

344
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
so i think yet still

345
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,480
yeah two people rebuild and i believe

346
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
yeah

347
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,160
yeah i think good enough so maybe some

348
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,720
other somebody else some rebuild it'll

349
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,480
be better yeah

350
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,880
yeah and again the finesse is it's not

351
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
an impeachment of the work it's not

352
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
saying it's kind of good enough what

353
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,120
it's really asserting is that it was

354
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,040
developed with a consensus-based process

355
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,519
which means that

356
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,880
again it's a product of the working

357
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,000
group and the working group kind of

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,360
agrees so what we need is for the

359
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,040
working group to say we're good with

360
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,800
that and again the director reviews are

361
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
great but the director reviews are on

362
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,079
the side of the working group they're in

363
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,600
addition to because we brought them in

364
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,279
and we wouldn't consider them as part of

365
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,079
the consensus process

366
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,920
does that make sense yeah it makes sense

367
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,320
to me i think we will

368
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,680
definitely um solicited more people to

369
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
review people sitting here maybe you

370
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,160
know reach out to them to review it

371
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
yeah it's just young mother is really

372
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
hard to review um it's like writing code

373
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
right it's not like a word document

374
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,120
people

375
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,920
yeah in a sense this is the check

376
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,519
to kind of exactly the point getting

377
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,680
reviews is hardened uh i fully kind of

378
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
recognize that but this is in a sense is

379
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,279
the check if we do not have enough

380
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,120
energy to have people review the final

381
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
thing then we probably don't have enough

382
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,959
energy to publish and this is the check

383
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,480
that there's consensus in the working

384
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,399
group to do this and there's energy to

385
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,040
kind of finish all of that

386
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
yeah and the transparency kind of to the

387
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,399
comment the transparency on the list

388
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,759
that's clutch because if it's happening

389
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,199
on the side it's great but we're not

390
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,800
aware of it through the normal process

391
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,399
and so the mailing list is the place to

392
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,440
document it thanks

393
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,240
just for full transparency this is diego

394
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,360
lopez

395
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,759
in some cases i must confess my in my

396
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,680
case that for example i have i have

397
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
reviewed the document

398
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,680
it seemed okay and simply

399
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,279
you feel like you don't you don't have

400
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,279
the time to i mean the time i'm talking

401
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,680
the ten seconds to say well it's okay

402
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,040
just because you have all the other

403
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,079
things that that distracts you but but

404
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,759
uh

405
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,240
that's uh

406
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,399
yeah i mean the there's different ways

407
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,000
to kind of get to the consensus process

408
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
but my concern in measuring that

409
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,279
consensus because that's what the

410
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,800
working group chairs are doing is the

411
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,040
only evidence we have is the meetings

412
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,120
and the mailing lists and so we don't

413
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,199
have i mean my assessment and i think

414
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,959
i've put this on the mailing list before

415
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,320
my assessment is we haven't met in a

416
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,680
while which again is perfectly fine

417
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,800
certain working groups have a different

418
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,560
tempo but if you take a look at the

419
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,120
working group mailing list from the last

420
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,199
two years three years

421
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,759
there are no there is no discussion of

422
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,600
the documents it is the document authors

423
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,679
which is great it is the director

424
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,760
reviewers but the work group is entirely

425
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,240
silent on all of the edits and so from

426
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
my perspective i can't tell that there's

427
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,000
consensus what i see are the document

428
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,599
authors are being incredibly responsive

429
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,359
to the reviews but the working group is

430
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,119
not at all commenting when we were

431
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,199
talking two plus years where we don't

432
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,359
see that at all and so on this way out i

433
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,640
really want to make sure that we've

434
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
double checked the consensus especially

435
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,839
how long it took for some of those

436
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,520
others which is where this consensus

437
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,799
kind of concern kind of came from that

438
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,559
maybe we don't have enough eyes on it as

439
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,080
it exits the working word

440
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,960
so i want to say one thing to roman uh

441
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,480
so you know young

442
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,240
the code case i

443
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
theogo mentioned is hard to uh some

444
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,400
review so in the past the tom patch he

445
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,960
you know slowly uh review gave a lot of

446
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
comments last two years

447
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,000
so we uh worked very hard

448
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,080
actually we actually worked hard in

449
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,880
terms of young some fixing something at

450
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,320
that time working with people i think

451
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,200
it's hard to give some specific so tom

452
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
pets also young doctors

453
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,760
so we got a lot of you know comments we

454
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,880
yeah

455
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,080
so at moment maybe somebody else yeah

456
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,600
maybe

457
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
also we approved using the the

458
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,360
implementation so i think yeah so but

459
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,160
yeah

460
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,799
so if you think we need more comment

461
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,760
maybe we can looking for so but yeah

462
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,400
well so roman is i find it's interesting

463
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,039
i went to this open source uh gathering

464
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,600
today at lunchtime uh for many of the

465
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,080
extensions in the routing area they're

466
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
required to render implementations right

467
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,520
so um there's some proposals in bgp for

468
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,679
example you look at the code and then

469
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,520
you run the code they have test

470
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,400
configurations so that if you can run

471
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,640
through the test then you are okay

472
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,960
because some of the features like can be

473
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,679
encoding so integrated details like

474
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,480
people

475
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,240
don't care like i know the information

476
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,080
but i don't really care how you arrange

477
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,720
the fit so i wonder if maybe it's like

478
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,440
data model they should have some kind of

479
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,360
testing what we do have young doctors

480
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,799
reviewing

481
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,200
testing

482
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,200
yeah i mean i don't know the the answer

483
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,640
to the general purpose thing but kind of

484
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,160
from my perspective we have a working

485
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
group whose only job is to make yang

486
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
modules and so in a sense i appreciate

487
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,240
it's an arcane thing but if in that case

488
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
i mean if it's an arcane thing that's

489
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,039
what we brought a working group together

490
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,400
to do right it should be all yang

491
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,160
experts with the domain expertise to

492
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,960
kind of model and if not then

493
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
then we actually in fact do need outside

494
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,000
help which i don't know whether we need

495
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,679
but like what we need is review which is

496
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,280
the yang experts that gathered in this

497
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,600
room need to put eyeballs on and said i

498
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,440
looked at it and i am comfortable with

499
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,120
it or i have feedback so it's not so

500
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
much we need comments as in we need to

501
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,559
find issues with the document i'm not

502
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,320
saying that at all what we need is an

503
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
assertion of consensus which is people

504
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,600
have looked at it and we're comfortable

505
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,199
with it uh to kind of go

506
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,840
okay yeah all of that as well yeah

507
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,600
that's right thank you i think that's

508
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,840
good

509
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,240
okay so we move to next

510
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,640

chef i deliver high level

532
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,720
policy to secret control security

533
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,080
controller

534
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,400
and nfi deliver

535
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,240
the translated low-level policy to ns

536
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,080
target nsf

537
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,399
next please

538
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,440
for

539
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,679
well understanding

540
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,559
let me

541
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,880
let me introduce

542
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,240
about the cfi cfi is

543
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,880
required because the web application

544
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,919
developed by each vendor need to have

545
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,679
standard interface

546
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,280
specifying the data types

547
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,120
used when the itunes user and security

548
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,520
controller communicate with each other

549
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,559
using

550
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,120
this interface therefore the cfi

551
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,679
document specified the required

552
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,440
information

553
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,120
their data type and encoding system

554
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,200
so that high-level security policy can

555
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,320
be transferred to security controller

556
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
through cfi

557
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,880
this high-level police can be translated

558
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,280
into low-level security policy by the

559
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,840
security controller next please

560
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,919
and apply

561
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,960
focus on the providing security policy

562
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,799
computation for

563
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,400
nsf as a low level policy to

564
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,880
deploy secret security service secret

565
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,159
controller delivered translated

566
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,480
low-level police to nsf according to

567
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,760
their respective security capabilities

568
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,520
their data modem

569
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
provide a generic nsf

570
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,679
and advanced

571
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,960
nsf such as ips

572
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,200
url filtering

573
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,520
next please

574
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,280
okay for

575
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,480
understanding how to

576
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,080
connect ci pi to nfi

577
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
let me introduce

578
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,440
top time level young 3 com comparison

579
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,960
as you can see the

580
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,000
these

581
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,720
show the consumer pacing interface time

582
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
level young tree

583
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,799
and this show at

584
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,480
nsf page interface time level m3 as you

585
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
can see they have a

586
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,279
similar structure

587
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,080
next place

588
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,120
yeah this this tree is low level young

589
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,679
tree comparison

590
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,520
this studies show

591
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,919
consumer-facing interface

592
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,600
low-level young tree

593
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,240
and this side shows nsf pacing in

594
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,200
interface low-level young tree as you

595
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,320
can see

596
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,200
uh

597
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,440
cfa and ipad data model use the event

598
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,679
condition action policy

599
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,360
use yeah

600
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,679
that kind of structure

601
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,320
next please

602
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,840
so

603
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,960
little relationship between cfi and nfi

604
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,559
cfi and nfi have almost one to one

605
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,080
mapping relation the young tree of cfi

606
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,720
and nfi have similar structure based on

607
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,679
itunes capability young data model

608
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,400
with this characteristic the

609
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,039
attribute of cfra young module can be

610
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,679
mapped to an api young module by

611
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,600
determining deterministic mapping

612
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,640
algorithm there is a zhang algorithm

613
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,320
the value of

614
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,640
the attributes of sharepoint policy

615
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,600
example 5 can be converted to those of

616
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
the attributes of antibiotics exam

617
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,799
required by determining finite

618
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,240
automata

619
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,200
the value of the attributes of the nfi

620
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,240
policy can be con constructed into

621
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,240
ns and nfy police exam required by young

622
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
aurelia ii

623
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,039
that is

624
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,960
such as

625
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,159
pyongyang next please

626
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,679
this figure

627
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,559
show

628
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,880
exemplary architecture of security

629
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
policy translator

630
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,559
secretary's translator has five

631
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,159
components as parallel

632
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,080
arrows nsf database data model mapper

633
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,200
data extractor data converter and policy

634
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,039
generator

635
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,600
next please

636
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,120
yeah folder

637
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,799
okay this is

638
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,600
this figure show high level policy for

639
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,720
sms

640
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,240
access blocking

641
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,600
example

642
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,480
this high level policy is border

643
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,760
blocking

644
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,279
access to the

645
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,320
web sns website during

646
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
office hour

647
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,039
as you can see the kind of high level

648
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,480
information must change to the low level

649
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,039
policy

650
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,840
next please

651
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,520
this video shows

652
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,559
the

653
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,640
procedural policy

654
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,159
provisioning with

655
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,760
nsf

656
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,159
the high-level police data

657
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,480
compared to the low level participator

658
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,200
in secret secret controller

659
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,559
and then

660
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,320
low level policy

661
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,480
delivered to the

662
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,840
target nsf according to the

663
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,639
capability next please

664
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,159
so the

665
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,400
high level policy finally

666
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,640
translates to those

667
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,760
two low low level policy first is low

668
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
level policy for prior

669
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,120
secondary support web filter

670
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,000
as you can see there

671
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,159
that kind of

672
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,960
in this build employee translate to the

673
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,080
on i project bonded to exterminate

674
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,320
and the

675
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,200
web sns website translates into facebook

676
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,440
and instagram

677
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,679
next please

678
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,960
for the next step

679
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,200
this draft explained the relationship

680
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,039
between cfi and nfi as guideline for

681
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:00,080
security translation it helped the

682
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,480
audience to understand how to link the

683
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,480
cfi data model and an nfi data model is

684
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,440
not just on exemplary architecture and

685
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
procedure of security secretary's

686
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,880
translator

687
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,360
with this threat put on implementer can

688
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,799
design and implement it on spd that can

689
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,679
work in the itunes ecosystem

690
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,399
this drift drift is proposed as a

691
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,640
working item in itunes assembly

692
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,720
chartering thank you thank you for

693
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
listening

694
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,520
yeah this is uh jean paul john

695
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
from skku

696
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,399
so the this draft i'm one of an author

697
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,360
of this draft uh let me briefly uh

698
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,440
explain this motivation

699
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,880
so this is

700
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,520
the raptor explain

701
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,360
relationship between cfi and nfi

702
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,480
for guideline so without this draft it

703
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
is a very hard implementer to figure out

704
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
how to translate

705
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,799
cfi xml high level young

706
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,720
and low level young

707
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
based on nfi

708
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,520
so we focus on this relationship between

709
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,559
two

710
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,240
data young models

711
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,159
and then let

712
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,159
the audience can understand easily how

713
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,360
to link to each other and the implement

714
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,720
and also as appendix we can suggest the

715
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,039
exemplary architecture and procedure

716
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,159
rather than some implementation detail

717
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,880
some direct normal mentioned so we just

718
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,760
focus on the relationship about two data

719
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,720
models okay that's it thank you thank

720
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,360
you very much um i do have questions it

721
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,840
seems like almost like a dns the name to

722
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,559
the address the the high level

723
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,760
name or context to the low level mapping

724
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,000
so with that you will need some kind of

725
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,880
external database to rely on right to do

726
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
the translation

727
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,440
so

728
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,919
it's showing here i didn't see it

729
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,960
like like for example i want the entire

730
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,520
group to do something but this group

731
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
information has to be

732
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,440
represented in some kind of

733
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,919
database right right exactly so

734
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,600
could you show the some

735
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,719
our architecture

736
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,240
yeah

737
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,200
show the database architecture

738
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,640
okay so you can see we have the nsf

739
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,919
database

740
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,480
so we can populate some employee

741
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,000
information

742
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,279
name and

743
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,399
their ip address based on the dhcp and

744
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,760
also url case uh some sns website case

745
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,960
instagram youtube facebook like that

746
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,840
kinds of populated into nsf database

747
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,279
linda mentioned

748
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,679
dns database so we can

749
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,039
so actually the popul population of that

750
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,760
database case a kind of current our

751
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,679
consumer patient also

752
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,360
we export as i remember patrick right

753
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,240
so we consumer phase interface also

754
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,200
dealing with the population that kind of

755
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,960
database entries

756
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,200
with those information however young xml

757
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,760
can be easily translated into low level

758
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,480
young using our procedure yeah

759
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,200
okay

760
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,039
this is developers

761
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,760
a few things uh i'm glad to see that

762
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,080
you're moving the architecture to uh to

763
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,559
an exemplary and not such part of the

764
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,080
text as would

765
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,000
uh there are a couple of things

766
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,320
regarding i mean one is that brings to

767
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,440
my my mind the discussion today on the

768
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,159
two about the levels of detail here

769
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,519
probably

770
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,399
making some consideration about uh

771
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,399
extensions that can be dynamically added

772
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,799
by the translation process would be uh

773
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,159
important

774
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,559
because not necessarily a one-to-one

775
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,880
mapping from the from the consumer phase

776
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,440
to the nsf facing probably something

777
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,600
possibility of adding uh of adding

778
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
extensions that would be more important

779
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,919
on the side of the nsf because the

780
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,240
translator has some additional knowledge

781
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,279
would be interesting and another thing

782
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,480
is that the

783
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,760
in the

784
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,600
ops group

785
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,720
we are discussing precisely

786
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,320
how to establish

787
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,720
beyond these core correspondence with

788
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
names etc are trying to go a little bit

789
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,360
beyond in the connection between models

790
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,200
and instances of the models and when you

791
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
have a model that is related to another

792
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,120
model how you relate the instances

793
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,760
uh mapping again the the same connection

794
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,519
that are in the models mapping them on

795
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,600
the instances this is something that

796
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,080
probably

797
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,120
we should try to consider what i i will

798
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,880
do because the

799
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,519
people that are working on this

800
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,480
are

801
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,120
unless one of the authors of this series

802
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,440
of drafts is uh working with me and i'll

803
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,519
put you in contact because i think there

804
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,799
is a

805
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,000
potential here to precisely apply these

806
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,840
and enhance the translation process

807
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,880
just can you use the microsoft

808
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,279
yeah hello everyone my name is patrick

809
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,600
from sunglass university so basically in

810
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,159
our uh current draft we are proposing

811
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,320
like a the relationship right between

812
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,200
the two data models we have the high

813
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,440
level policy which is the cfi and then

814
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,799
we have the low level policy which is

815
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,159
the nfi and in these two data models

816
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,000
uh so in the

817
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,120
nfi

818
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,519
we designed it we designed it to be have

819
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,519
more details right we have like access

820
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,918
control list which is imported from

821
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,760
rsc8519

822
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,560
and in in that

823
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,440
it has like every single

824
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,879
headers of uh packets from layer 2 layer

825
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,760
3 layer 4 and so on and

826
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,000
but in our contour facing we are

827
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,280
designing

828
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,520
for

829
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,280
very small details

830
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,399
that

831
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,639
basically use users without expertise on

832
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,440
those

833
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
parameters on those

834
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,560
on those

835
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,079
packet headers

836
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,119
they can

837
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,760
try to use our framework

838
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,280
and the purpose

839
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,440
so that we need a translator

840
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,079
in

841
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,480
it's necessary right for our framework

842
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,159
and that's why we need to propose we

843
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,280
need to have this mapping between these

844
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,800
two data models yeah thank you

845
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,560
hi roman daniella wearing no hat just as

846
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,400
cardigan man university uh i think i

847
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,720
have two interrelated uh kind of

848
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,960
questions how how do folks that are

849
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,839
using iqsf now bridging the gap between

850
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,079
the two models and then my related kind

851
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,280
of question is

852
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,839
is that secret sauce of the implementers

853
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,359
i mean is there i mean do we need

854
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,640
standardization in that mapping

855
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,079
in a couple of projects related with uh

856
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:40,880
well

857
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,200
actually we are relating this with with

858
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,960
the management of the supply chains and

859
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,400
all the like

860
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,520
and

861
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,240
well currently what the what the people

862
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,760
that are developing this are doing is

863
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,280
using

864
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,680
well is using a process similar to this

865
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,440
but it's not general because the the

866
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,320
policies are very much uh are

867
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,480
very much reduced and controlled so they

868
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,720
are a set of rules that are quite

869
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,480
straightforward so they are not applying

870
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,599
this this general case

871
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,200
that the uh as i said before if

872
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,359
we consider here precisely the

873
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,359
correspondence between the different

874
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,520
instances of the of the different models

875
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,119
and how they are related

876
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,400
and the the how the extensions could be

877
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,720
uh could be linked i think i think that

878
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,640
would make sense i mean when we talk

879
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,160
about extensions because it's important

880
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,880
thing

881
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,720
that a vendor comes with extensions and

882
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,400
how you connect one to the others and

883
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,880
how you connect the instances i think we

884
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,520
we should or we could explore that space

885
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,960
so a woman comment is this draft

886
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,320
explained

887
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,760
some uh linkies between two uh model

888
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,800
because

889
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,839
uh almost a one-to-one mapping but not

890
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,680
exactly one tool mapping

891
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,800
patrick

892
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,240
yeah mentioned

893
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,599
so certain uh some detail is missing in

894
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,560
a consumer face interface such as users

895
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,599
group

896
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,040
just the user could write letters than

897
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,720
ipv0006 ipv4 addresses and so those are

898
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,920
can be translated using nsf database can

899
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,280
be handled by that so this document is

900
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,240
filling that gap between consumer pacing

901
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,359
and energy

902
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,839
facing interfaces without this document

903
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,960
it is very hard to figure out how to

904
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,640
link to each other because

905
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,280
the i'm editor for those

906
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,599
data model i'm well aware of that but

907
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,000
other people no idea

908
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,240
so translator is a very important piece

909
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,720
of our itunes app and with this one and

910
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,200
the people can easily understand their

911
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,280
young models and then they can make it

912
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,320
so that is the purpose of this document

913
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,560
okay

914
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,119
so so if i'm kind of summer to summarize

915
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,280
i guess my question was primarily

916
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,640
why would i'm not saying that the

917
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,160
translation didn't need to happen i'm

918
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,480
asking why does that has to happen in a

919
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,200
standardized way and you're saying that

920
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,720
is it fair to say that because you could

921
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,320
have an ecosystem of different kind of

922
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,160
extensions you need to kind of guide

923
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,480
that translation

924
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,800
because there is heterogeneity like the

925
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,400
the models be kind of different so we

926
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,160
need to provide more guidance so we can

927
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,118
in fact do the translation

928
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,839
thank you very

929
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,480
much so

930
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,520
should we go to the next one

931
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,800
yeah okay let me start

932
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,720
hello everyone my name is patrick linga

933
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,560
i'm from singaporean university from

934
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,320
south korea

935
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,160
well this is my actually my first

936
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,560
meeting in itf

937
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,480
in person i've attended online

938
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,680
previously

939
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,480
so

940
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,400
can you put me on the next slide please

941
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,520
okay so

942
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,440
basically i want to talk to you about

943
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,240
the

944
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,160
the new draft that we are proposing

945
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,280
which is the

946
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,800
previously we called it application

947
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,599
interface and we received a comment that

948
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,760
this name can be confusing and because

949
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,520
for that reason we we changed it into

950
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,680
analytics information and analytics

951
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,079
interface that

952
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,560
it's the naming itself is much more

953
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,640
clearer and you can clearly know what's

954
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,200
the meaning of analytics interfaces okay

955
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,839
next slide please

956
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,760
so yeah this is the updated frameworks

957
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,920
basically we added a component and

958
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,359
another interface

959
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,119
in the previous

960
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,920
versions we call it application now for

961
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,640
next slide please

962
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,119
yes now we call it analytics interface

963
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,480
as you can see it's

964
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
much more easier to understand that

965
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,319
what's the purpose of it instead of

966
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,000
saying it's an application right now

967
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,240
it's analytics interface yeah next type

968
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,479
please

969
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,319
okay so

970
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,280
uh the in here now we added a new

971
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,760
component which is the i2nsf analyzer

972
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,560
this analyzer is purpose is we collect

973
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,640
monitoring data from

974
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,960
those nsf's that's working

975
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,920
they

976
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,560
collect all of the important information

977
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,599
all of the data and try to analyze it

978
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,560
and

979
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,520
the

980
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
analysis we can use

981
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,200
machine learnings or anything but it's

982
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,280
not well it's not in the scope of our

983
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,000
draft but basically we needed some kind

984
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,880
of

985
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,560
entity that

986
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,000
analyzed this information and then we

987
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,359
can

988
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,680
provide some more useful information

989
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,200
from this data

990
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,160
next slide please

991
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,119
okay so to provide those analytics data

992
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,319
we

993
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,800
we propose this analytics interface so

994
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,319
this interface is between the security

995
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,880
controller and the analyzer so after the

996
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,280
iterative analyzer analyze those

997
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,960
monitoring data

998
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,319
it will try

999
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,480
to

1000
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,800
provide a new information

1001
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,599
or

1002
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,319
the configurations like what how to

1003
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,359
solve the

1004
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,480
what's issue in the current

1005
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,000
network right

1006
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,480
so we propose this analytics interface

1007
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
so that that analyzer can send

1008
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
information to the security controller

1009
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,200
next slide please

1010
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,920
so yeah uh

1011
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,200
why do we need a nsf analytics interface

1012
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,720
so

1013
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,839
as you know our of our

1014
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,400
servers networks are they are running 24

1015
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,760
7 and then

1016
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,800
and you you don't know what's going to

1017
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,119
happen in the in the during the time

1018
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,640
right

1019
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,119
and anyone can attack your servers and

1020
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,800
it or it can goes bad immediately so

1021
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
it's very important that we have some

1022
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,319
sort of analyzers that

1023
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,040
what's what's happening in our

1024
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,280
system right now so

1025
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,599
the analyzer can collect the data and

1026
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,920
those monitoring data and then we

1027
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,359
basically try to

1028
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,880
make sure everything is okay and then

1029
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,280
by analyzing those uh activity and

1030
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,599
performance basically we can create a

1031
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,599
closed loop security control

1032
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,520
this is this is used so that we can

1033
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520
enhance the network security through the

1034
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,079
analysis of those monitoring data

1035
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,960
and by adding the two components and

1036
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,240
basically one component and one

1037
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,200
interface we allow what we call security

1038
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,800
management automation

1039
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,200
and this is supports automatic

1040
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,839
adaptation and also

1041
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,280
we can

1042
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,400
support

1043
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,040
adaptability basically yeah next slide

1044
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,839
please

1045
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,560
okay so

1046
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,480
in this analytics interface there are

1047
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,839
two roles that we are

1048
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:06,880
we needed

1049
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,200
to provide an enhancement of this

1050
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,280
network security the first one is the

1051
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,599
the policy configuration second one is

1052
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,839
the feedback information basically on

1053
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,160
both of these roles we provided three

1054
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,119
fields which is the nsf name

1055
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,359
the problems which is the

1056
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,599
issue that we are having currently and

1057
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,760
then we have also the solutions what is

1058
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,079
the possible solutions for

1059
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,920
the issue that we are having currently

1060
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,000
next slide please

1061
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,880
so

1062
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,400
the first one is the policy

1063
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,760
configuration

1064
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,599
the purpose of this policy configuration

1065
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,079
is basically when we are having an nsf

1066
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:42,960
that's

1067
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,319
working

1068
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,599
uh

1069
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,280
all the time and then we collect those

1070
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,040
information what's going on what is

1071
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,599
happening in our network and then when

1072
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,520
we analyze those data

1073
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,280
and then we can provide some sort of a

1074
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,640
reconfiguration or a configuration

1075
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,560
because we want to enhance what's

1076
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,119
happening in the network right so if we

1077
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,640
find out something

1078
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,920
is terribly going on then we need to

1079
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,440
reconfigure

1080
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
those uh

1081
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,319
configurations on those nsfs so to do

1082
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,240
that we created some sort of a closed

1083
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,480
loop that is basically giving a feedback

1084
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,720
over and over so that our

1085
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,400
network is safe

1086
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,440
okay next slide please

1087
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,960
and we have a feedback information which

1088
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,079
is

1089
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,560
a different kind of information that's

1090
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,560
delivered from the analyzer

1091
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,319
in this case it's not

1092
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,079
really a configuration

1093
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,319
for example if we

1094
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,200
in our network system we have some

1095
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,599
hardware failure or any

1096
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,319
hardware overloaded so in this kind of

1097
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,920
things we cannot handle it with just a

1098
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,200
security policy right so we need to have

1099
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,240
another solution and in this case

1100
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,319
those solutions

1101
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,240
may or may not be

1102
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,280
used and we need to report them to the

1103
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,920
users and or maybe

1104
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,720
cury something extra to the developer

1105
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,240
management system

1106
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,599
so that that is what the feedback

1107
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,359
information is

1108
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,839
next slide please

1109
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,520
so yeah the next step for this travis

1110
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,079
analytics interface is an interface for

1111
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,560
security management automation

1112
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,160
so with this

1113
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,760
new interface we created the closed-loop

1114
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,079
security control that improve

1115
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,280
the and enhance the security policy

1116
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,760
and also the network security itself

1117
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,640
and

1118
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,880
in the young module this is based on the

1119
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,640
nsf facing interface and monitoring

1120
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,400
interface

1121
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,839
and

1122
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,720
also this draft facilitates both the

1123
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
report and query for security management

1124
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,000
automation

1125
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,240
and we want to propose this draft as a

1126
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,839
working group item in the next nsf

1127
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,240
recharging thank you

1128
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,280
i do have a question for this just

1129
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,880
curious um

1130
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,599
so

1131
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,760
the interface the information going

1132
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,599
through this interface

1133
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,480
would that be same as nsf or

1134
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,440
consumer-based interface for like

1135
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,000
reconfiguration if you want to

1136
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,160
reconfigure some policies

1137
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,000
don't you use a subset of the

1138
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,119
compute consumer phase interface or nsf

1139
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,920
actually the we actually uh uh my name

1140
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,560
is jerome porzing skku

1141
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,760
so this uh analytics interface uh um

1142
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,400
import uh nsf phase interface and the

1143
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,680
monitoring

1144
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,040
data model young module so

1145
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,560
the thing is

1146
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,920
so it identifies nsf name

1147
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,280
and also some problem and the solution

1148
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,800
so that is a kind of lever so it just

1149
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,440
the user so yeah your life yeah we are

1150
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,760
using the existing nsf facing and

1151
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,480
monitoring interface

1152
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,960
but not exactly same so that's why we

1153
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,359
propose and also this purpose is we

1154
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,240
provide the closure security control so

1155
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,480
i think that is additional required

1156
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,599
piece okay thank you

1157
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,760
yeah thanks my name is uh george

1158
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,319
garcia's from hawaii this is a question

1159
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,720
on the feedback that you are proposing

1160
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,559
is this a synchronous feedback or

1161
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,000
asynchronous

1162
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,240
and if you see synchronous what is the

1163
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,280
periodicity of getting information for

1164
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,520
monitoring

1165
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,480
you understand the question

1166
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,839
can you explain a bit more about

1167
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,599
synchronous and asynchronous means yeah

1168
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,119
synchronous is when you actually

1169
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,559
periodically uh collect information so

1170
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,040
you know a period of time or a

1171
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,960
synchronous when something happens when

1172
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,920
an event

1173
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,079
happens then you collect information i

1174
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,200
see yeah so

1175
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,040
this collect information is based on our

1176
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,960
monitoring and our monitoring is based

1177
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,359
on a notification based or report base

1178
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,559
right so when the something happens

1179
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,400
we're going to report it to the analyzer

1180
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,800
analyzer will realize what's happening

1181
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,559
and then we're gonna give some sort of

1182
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,800
reconfiguration to handle it

1183
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,400
right yeah that's

1184
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,119
asynchronous

1185
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,479
thank you

1186
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,359
hi roman de niro uh carnegie mellon

1187
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,880
university no hat

1188
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,160
could you

1189
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,680
in the kind of the decomposition of

1190
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,119
what's in the data model there was this

1191
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,359
box of problem in solution

1192
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,119
i'm looking in the draft and i apologize

1193
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,559
i didn't read it so i'm as smart as

1194
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,839
scrolling through it and kind of looking

1195
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,160
kind of at your slides can you explain

1196
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,960
kind of a little more about

1197
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,480
what gets put in that problem and kind

1198
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,480
of solution i guess i'm not exactly kind

1199
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,839
of following level though given the

1200
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,559
level of specificity in in kind of the

1201
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,240
data model it seems kind of high level

1202
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,319
and selective kind of what's the can you

1203
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,400
keep walking through that so

1204
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,319
okay but we're talking about a problem

1205
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,839
and a solution so this problem is

1206
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,440
basically those monitoring data right

1207
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,079
when we for example you

1208
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,160
in your network you get some ddos attack

1209
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,079
there is a problem right

1210
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,160
that type is something we call the

1211
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,559
problem here that we need to be solved

1212
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,400
and then this solution is maybe some

1213
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,559
sort of reconfiguration we ask

1214
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,640
some ddos mitigator

1215
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,480
to block a certain

1216
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,359
uh packet from someone like for yeah

1217
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,520
from some ip right so that is the

1218
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,440
solutions

1219
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,040
right

1220
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,880
so the problem is just

1221
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,800
what's going on in the network the

1222
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,240
solution is

1223
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,119
it can be a reconfiguration or we can

1224
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,440
ask require some sort of things here

1225
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,079
so yeah so thanks for that kind of

1226
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,520
specific example since you mentioned a

1227
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,119
denial service deck you would say the

1228
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,920
problem is i have this attack

1229
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,319
source address on this port yes and that

1230
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,200
would be the example of a problem

1231
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,960
okay thanks yeah thank you

1232
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,559
it would be nice if you can add those

1233
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,319
examples

1234
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,160
i have the same questions

1235
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,000
yeah actually we have some example but i

1236
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,480
didn't put it in this slides yeah okay

1237
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
yeah thank you

1238
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,160
okay so

1239
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,440
uh

1240
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,920
so the tutoring is quickly i will

1241
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,319
there's another one

1242
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,319
okay

1243
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,800
am i herobot

1244
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,280
yes yes we can hear you very well

1245
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,359
i'm not hearing you linda so i'm gonna

1246
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,880
trust that i'm gonna

1247
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,880
you'll need to tell me if i can't be

1248
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,359
heard someone at the main mic i can't

1249
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,400
hear linda's mic remotely

1250
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,640
i'm gonna go ahead

1251
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,839
and hope that you all hear me by the

1252
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,119
chat window

1253
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,640
look um

1254
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,680
we're trying to finish

1255
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,920
linda if you can't hear i'm sorry sue if

1256
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,520
you can't hear linda's microphone i'm

1257
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,359
speaking from the the microphone from

1258
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,800
the floor we can hear you loud and clear

1259
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,440
so just proceed okay that's great

1260
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,680
i couldn't hear linda's uh could be the

1261
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,559
connection i'm in an airport i'm sorry

1262
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,559
look guys we're

1263
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,400
the bgp uh

1264
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,599
[Music]

1265
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,000
model is trying to finish a few of its

1266
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,520
last pieces

1267
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,400
and we're trying to look at uh some

1268
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,160
things that are working linda go to the

1269
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,400
next slide between two bgp peers

1270
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,559
so this is the model

1271
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,359
and what we have is a secure session

1272
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,480
a container inside of the bgp piers that

1273
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,480
would make a lot of sense

1274
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,160
the options currently we have are ao md5

1275
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,400
and ipsec you can see with the

1276
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,839
discussion

1277
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,720
down at the bottom why i need help

1278
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,839
um i had a long talk with mahesh and

1279
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:08,400
um uh who chair also chairs um

1280
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,960
net conf so

1281
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,160
here you find that we really need help

1282
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,240
to find out if we've got the right

1283
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,920
grouping

1284
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,960
paul has suggested a few things but

1285
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,440
this is why i don't know if

1286
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,760
if we have a

1287
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,319
right now we just put in a string

1288
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,559
security association name

1289
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,920
but i really need to find which group is

1290
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
is going to help us with that

1291
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,559
next slide

1292
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,119
you notice the other ones have key

1293
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,960
chains so

1294
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,640
one of the thing is you want to make

1295
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,400
sure that you can

1296
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,960
have a security association

1297
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,200
perhaps

1298
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,359
i don't know

1299
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,880
operationally

1300
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,200
people seem to change

1301
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,760
their security association some very

1302
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,559
rarely but they also want operational

1303
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,599
state

1304
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,000
okay so that's my need

1305
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,800
um what i don't know is if it's

1306
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,319
i2n

1307
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,280
i2 nsf or if it's

1308
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,880
ipsec me go ahead now to paul's uh

1309
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,440
slides that he helped me this is paul's

1310
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,200
suggestion

1311
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,640
go ahead linda next slide

1312
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,920
um

1313
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,680
why do we need

1314
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,200
ipsec

1315
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,160
you notice that it it's within a trusted

1316
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,599
cloud because many of them are being

1317
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,040
within a

1318
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,720
the

1319
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,319
network provider

1320
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,480
it could be across a physically secure

1321
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,839
private link

1322
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,559
and it could be across an exchange point

1323
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,040
which we'll call an open internet

1324
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,599
so the ipsec

1325
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,400
can be used any of those cases

1326
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,960
what's good about it is you really need

1327
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,119
to have some sort of monitoring so this

1328
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,800
is a case where

1329
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,880
you're seeing i

1330
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,119
uh to nsf work in the model uh i always

1331
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,880
envisioned and i'm

1332
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,640
i that's a

1333
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,760
where the i2 nsf may be

1334
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,599
uh integral parts inside of a larger

1335
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,400
uh combinatory box routers and uh

1336
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,800
security devices again

1337
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,599
this is all

1338
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,000
sort of please help if i'm in the wrong

1339
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,040
place send me someplace else so but send

1340
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,280
me someplace i can get help

1341
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,559
um next slide

1342
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,280
paul suggests and i agree that it's

1343
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,480
this

1344
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,040
building blocks that i

1345
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,079
to nsf is very useful because we have

1346
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,640
some of the same things inside of

1347
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,359
uh routing places you have something

1348
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,559
that's controlling the security be it

1349
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,760
md5 or be it ao

1350
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,440
using key chains

1351
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,520
something that watches it and gets

1352
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,400
operational state and then something

1353
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,880
that is a configuration backend which is

1354
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,440
really the development management system

1355
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,400
and a user which in this case oftentimes

1356
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,839
is the network

1357
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,680
you can see that we have multiple

1358
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:22,240
gateways and that uh the 5d systems will

1359
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,319
probably grow in that

1360
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,319
next next slide linda

1361
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,319
and again i try i'm going to try to be

1362
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,720
brief so here's where paul was

1363
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,960
suggesting kindly to me that rfc 9061

1364
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,520
might be used

1365
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,400
that's what i thought initially i had

1366
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,400
debates with my co-authors because

1367
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,480
mahesh's

1368
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,240
jeff are familiar with the key chains

1369
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,440
but we couldn't get to a a solid point

1370
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,559
so

1371
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,559
paul is right you can either run i

1372
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,000
reckless

1373
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,559
uh you need to question but what i

1374
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,559
really need um

1375
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,680
a discussion set of partners to to ask a

1376
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,319
whole bunch of questions and this is

1377
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,880
a bid am i at the right place

1378
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,960
i i pointed my co-authors at 90 61 to

1379
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,480
begin with

1380
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,680
but

1381
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,200
we got

1382
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,920
we ended up with some debate so next

1383
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,040
slide linda

1384
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,880
and then i think

1385
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,480
i'm done

1386
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,079
uh

1387
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,480
i need to find out am i in the right

1388
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,720
place to ask the question

1389
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,240
uh

1390
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,240
it it look look it if we go from there

1391
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,920
the question is whether we need to

1392
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,920
extend it or whether i just don't

1393
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,440
understand it

1394
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,559
and

1395
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,559
this is another one of the

1396
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,160
those cases where we're pushing at um

1397
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,559
models outside of the routing world

1398
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,200
because we're not sure how to plug into

1399
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,960
them but we

1400
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,599
don't want to invent our own right the

1401
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,760
idea is you need to glue it to the whole

1402
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,359
system so

1403
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,319
i know that you need to have a a

1404
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,079
discussion and i'm

1405
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,799
glad to take it to the list i just hope

1406
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,319
that

1407
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,880
i could get some feedback

1408
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,960
and linda you can i'll turn my mic off

1409
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,280
thank you

1410
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,559
okay so hello this is diego oh i see

1411
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,240
rafa is there as well

1412
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,079
so well i'll wait

1413
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,360
rougher now much better than myself

1414
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,079
[Music]

1415
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,079
no no no go ahead go ahead neil oh yeah

1416
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,680
no bro

1417
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,079
well no simply i i want it i want the

1418
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,599
simply to remark

1419
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,480
i think this is this could be an

1420
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,400
interesting approach the uh as long as

1421
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
we get

1422
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,680
the trust model right

1423
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,839
we should not forget is that we're

1424
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:55,359
talking about bgp um

1425
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:59,119
wait a second i'm gonna take them

1426
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,119
we we're talking about bgp reflectors

1427
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,599
that are in different domains

1428
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,880
and that are going to be submitted to uh

1429
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,720
to a common controller

1430
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,640
and that's uh that has trust

1431
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,880
implications because is that the

1432
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,200
autonomous systems are going to put

1433
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,760
trust on a on a common device that is

1434
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,079
somewhere

1435
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,480
the we have to be careful about this the

1436
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,920
my understanding of uh rfc

1437
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,640
1961 when it was conceived was precisely

1438
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,480
four highly centralized environments in

1439
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,440
which

1440
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,319
enterprises that were willing to connect

1441
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:38,960
their branches to central offices or the

1442
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,599
branches among them etc

1443
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,079
this is a totally different

1444
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,400
beast i would say because it's a and the

1445
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,400
trust model we have to understand well

1446
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,640
the trust model if we get the trans

1447
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,440
model right well why not when whether in

1448
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,200
the interesting conditions of this is

1449
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,799
that it would

1450
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,160
support

1451
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,760
whatever the kind of bilateral

1452
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,760
agreements between the different bgp

1453
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,960
domains i mean as long as you have your

1454
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,040
your bgp domain you have mine we agree

1455
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,160
that we trust uh paul's uh

1456
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,240
controller we are happy

1457
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,559
but again is can be tricky the trust

1458
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,319
model can be very tricky and we have to

1459
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:20,000
think about it but i must say i find it

1460
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,480
appealing

1461
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,720
from uh from a first uh

1462
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,359
from from uh from a touching base just

1463
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,760
touching this

1464
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,400
thank you thank you diego uh i may send

1465
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,720
you some questions on the background i

1466
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,599
realize the trust model is is

1467
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,599
in some cases uh within a common uh

1468
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,839
administrative area and sometimes very

1469
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:44,960
tricky

1470
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,599
so um i should be at itf i'll try to

1471
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,040
track you down

1472
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,119
uh what i need to know from roman and

1473
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,599
the rest is should i continue the

1474
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,079
discussion on the i2

1475
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:02,079
nsf list or should i go to ipsec me

1476
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,839
cheers here

1477
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,559
i'm sorry linda you were saying

1478
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,920
i'm not hearing you roman

1479
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,520
no sorry i thought linda was saying

1480
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,200
something so i was giving her the floor

1481
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,240
if she wanted to have the floor

1482
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,558
oh

1483
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,920
yeah yes yes i can hear you job that's

1484
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,559
why uh so a couple of comments regarding

1485
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:33,440
the

1486
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,480
uh

1487
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,880
what i can say is i

1488
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,200
agree with the

1489
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,880
paul's view

1490
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,480
about using rfc uh

1491
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,960
as it is because in to me to me

1492
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,760
basically we have two nsf

1493
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,559
both

1494
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,520
rveb routers that's fine you can use

1495
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,720
both models i don't see

1496
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,400
at the first side

1497
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,280
without any additional detail

1498
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,799
and you need to extend or to change that

1499
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,200
because in the end you need to apply

1500
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,839
a security association between two uh

1501
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,480
two end points and that's fine we can

1502
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,760
use the the rfc 9061

1503
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,480
regarding uh diego's comment

1504
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,240
regarding the other comment the my my

1505
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,839
opinion there is if two bgp routers

1506
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,799
belongs to two different domains then we

1507
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,880
are talking about two different

1508
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,000
controller security controllers managing

1509
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
two different vgp routers but then here

1510
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,400
what we are saying is we need something

1511
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,520
for the east-west interface between both

1512
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,960
uh

1513
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,480
security uh controllers

1514
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,200
to finally install something in the vgp

1515
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,760
but the northbound interface

1516
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,839
define i mean sorry the southbound

1517
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,079
interface defined in the

1518
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,400
in the rfc

1519
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,039
9061

1520
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:03,599
can be used uh directly that's my

1521
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,039
opinion and and i agree with paul's view

1522
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:07,839
uh

1523
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:08,880
this is

1524
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,200
this is why i was saying you uh you knew

1525
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,440
much better than me that's a very good

1526
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,400
idea

1527
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,720
sorry for nothing i'm feeling

1528
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,480
i'm feeling bad not for not thinking

1529
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,440
about that

1530
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,079
well and that boot implied that we would

1531
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,480
develop an east west interface for for

1532
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,240
1961 well

1533
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,200
yeah

1534
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,119
yeah that's that's that's a that they

1535
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,200
did something is that something an

1536
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,200
interface between controllers in my

1537
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,880
opinion if if two both bb routers are

1538
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,559
under a different

1539
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,400
uh

1540
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,440
security controller

1541
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,480
different security controller it is

1542
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,599
likely rafael that

1543
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,490
they each would have their unique

1544
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:53,960
[Music]

1545
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,480
i2nsf function

1546
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,559
inside of their system

1547
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,440
it might be um

1548
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,760
a third case which i didn't introduce

1549
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,680
which is there's a

1550
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,640
a route server in which case there are

1551
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,319
three players but

1552
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:15,039
uh i i get the point that it the i2ns

1553
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,760
nsf server needs to be

1554
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,359
in the

1555
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,280
uh security domain

1556
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,920
in the case of the route server

1557
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,720
um

1558
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,359
that might be three but i i see the

1559
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:30,319
point i think graphing what i'll do is

1560
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:32,799
uh work through the examples i had done

1561
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,960
and send them to you and

1562
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,119
and uh copy the

1563
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,400
uh

1564
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,520
um

1565
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,520
send them on the list and copy and make

1566
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,799
sure that we've got the right concept

1567
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:47,920
on that and if if i'm not bugging you

1568
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,319
guys too much that would be helpful i

1569
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,558
thanks

1570
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,559
so sue this is roman you as a d uh you

1571
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,559
asked me kind of a question so first

1572
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,480
that we're over time so we probably need

1573
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,720
to stop but kind of quickly i'm

1574
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,200
struggling how to understand

1575
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,039
why this would be the appropriate

1576
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,559
working group to continue doing

1577
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,599
additional modeling on ipsec or bgb

1578
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,599
things given that the one ipsec document

1579
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,359
we did was already on the bubble of the

1580
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,520
charter and i only approved it because

1581
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,359
for expediency since we were so far

1582
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:22,640
along and if we were doing from the

1583
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,079
beginning we would not have done it in

1584
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,200
this work here because it is out of

1585
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,240
scope for the current chart

1586
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,319
uh so you have near also co-chair of uh

1587
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,480
i i pissed comey

1588
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,119
the ipsec community working group

1589
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,400
looked at that

1590
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,520
draft that led to 1961 and rejected it

1591
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,440
we didn't want to do it so that's why it

1592
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,079
ended up here

1593
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,880
so yolo i'm sorry

1594
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,760
was that an and and roman let a no go

1595
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,240
fight go find ipsecny

1596
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,920
is that the direction i'm fine with

1597
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,920
either one i just

1598
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,079
want to get the answer

1599
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,720
and it's always possible to uh bring it

1600
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,440
back to ipisa me and dusk again

1601
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,000
but so far we've never done really ibiza

1602
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,520
policy we always assume that uh

1603
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,119
it's up to the user to make the

1604
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,280
configurations match and uh defining

1605
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,760
this east-west uh

1606
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,160
model here means that we're

1607
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,400
somewhere somehow negotiating between

1608
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,039
the controllers and coming up with a

1609
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,520
cohesive policy and that's

1610
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,599
that's a difficult thing that um ibiza

1611
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,400
me has never done

1612
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,440
a lot of time appreciate it

1613
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,440
thank you thank you very much

1614
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,400
so

1615
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,160
we are running out of time maybe we can

1616
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,079
continue on the mailing list about

1617
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,520
rechartering

1618
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,640
thank you thank you very much

1619
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,200
