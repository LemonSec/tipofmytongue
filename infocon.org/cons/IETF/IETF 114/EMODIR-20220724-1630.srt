1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,480
yes

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,400
questions

3
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,199
guys

4
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
um

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,880
uh

6
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,400
sorry

7
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,440
i'm not meant to laugh at you

8
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,280
yeah seems awesome

9
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,280
oh

10
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,159
all right

11
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,080
we're going to get started in just a

12
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,319
minute uh this is the newcomers overview

13
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,519
for ihf 114 so if you just

14
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,400
um

15
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,959
if you have not done this you need to uh

16
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,040
screen the qr code

17
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,560
um this is the way we keep track of

18
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,319
attendance in each meeting and you'll

19
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,840
get practice for it we have these we

20
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,959
used to have these things called blue

21
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,720
sheets which is the way we

22
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,799
uh kept track of who was in the room and

23
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,799
that's important for a number of reasons

24
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,840
actually

25
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,560
and because we are a standards process

26
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
we we need to do that so um you'll see

27
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,159
this

28
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,599
at the entrance to every meeting this

29
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,400
week and on the boards and things so and

30
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,799
that way uh you are recorded as having

31
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,319
been in the room for this particular

32
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,840
discussion

33
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,519
and when you think about app and open

34
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,879
standards it's important to know who's

35
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,439
in the room for the discussion

36
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
and one of the joys about being the

37
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,199
first session

38
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,639
is there's always

39
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,759
last-minute technical things

40
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
and as we go through this uh feel free

41
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,720
to go to the microphone if you have any

42
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,520
questions any of you that are remote

43
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,680
you can feel free to um

44
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
put yourself in the virtual queue i

45
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
guess we should practice the q

46
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
methodology while we're here as well so

47
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,520
you need to use your phone

48
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,680
to put yourself in the queue

49
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,199
and this will give us two advantages

50
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,560
during the week one

51
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
we won't have everybody lined up all

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
crowded around the microphone for

53
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
coveted reasons

54
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,479
and then the second one is it puts the

55
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,919
physical attendees that are here in

56
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,199
person on the same footing with the

57
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,360
remote attendees everybody gets their

58
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
their chance

59
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,280
their choice in line so

60
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,440
are we good now

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,479
we're good

62
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,400
great thanks

63
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,440
um

64
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
so there's one other thing um and i

65
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,039
meant to review it and stick a slide in

66
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,880
the slides and i didn't get it done and

67
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
that is uh the covet policy which is

68
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
which is posted everywhere so we do ask

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,800
everybody when you're in meeting rooms

70
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,440
to please wear a mask uh well when we're

71
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,800
speaking we're going to take it off to

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
make it a little bit clearer but we're

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
pretty far away from you uh and then

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
we'll put it back on so um

75
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,520
so with that

76
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,759
we'll go ahead and get started

77
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,639
um

78
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,000

have a uh these parts online as well

92
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,759
that's a little bit outdated and we're

93
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,199
revising it

94
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,479
and we're going to pull out the meeting

95
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,479
specific information so that the videos

96
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,479
online will be

97
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,720
you can see them in advance

98
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,560
but the four parts are here we're going

99
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,319
to talk really quickly sort of a high

100
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,319
level overview and an introduction to

101
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,639
the newcomers activities then we're

102
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,759
going to talk about the structure of the

103
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,440
ietf and then we're going to talk about

104
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,960
the meeting week and then we're going to

105
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,400
talk about additional resources that

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,759
would be helpful

107
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,759
so i introduced myself i actually wanted

108
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,400

sals i've been also involved in the itf

113
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,080
for a really long time

114
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,840
uh and

115
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,759
i have had a couple of different work

116
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,560
group chairs got involved in the

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,800
what's now emo der education mentoring

118
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,840
and outreach

119
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,800
a few years ago have been giving the

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,560
co-presenting this

121
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
tutorial

122
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
for several years

123
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,520
the last couple have obviously all been

124
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,880
virtual

125
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,199
so it's nice to see people you can only

126
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,160
see half the face but thank you

127
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,680
yes so um also

128
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,280
if anybody is interested in helping with

129
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,120
the emo directivities we're we'll ask

130
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
again at the end but any feedback you

131
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
have on information that you might have

132
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,360
missed or things that would help you uh

133
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,599
sort of find your way around the ietf uh

134
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,199
please be sure because that all helps us

135
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,840
make those activities

136
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,638
uh next slide

137
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,160
oh they're right there i don't know why

138
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
i'm looking backwards so anyway the

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,199
scope of this presentation is

140
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
specifically to help uh you prepare for

141
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,599
this meeting and to make this meeting uh

142
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
or you know your general introduction to

143
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,400
the ihf uh the most effective

144
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,840
this presentation does not include

145
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,759
things like the history of the ihf or

146
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,759
how to write a standard

147
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,919
or even how it touches on how to bring

148
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,680
new work to the ietf but there's a lot

149
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,440
more information

150
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,960
obviously we really just wanted to give

151
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,199
you a snapshot to get you started and

152
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,879
give you some pointers as to where to go

153
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,560
and then hopefully from there you'll

154
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,520
find the information that you need

155
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,758
next slide

156
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,319
there we go

157
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,879
uh so the first thing that uh you will

158
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,479
have seen this when you registered

159
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,799
actually even so the this uh the

160
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,958
notewell is the general set of policies

161
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,279
and rules that the ietf follows if you

162
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,440
have you need to at some point read

163
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,880
through these and if you go to the next

164
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,800
slide

165
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,680
it's this plus the list of policies that

166
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,239
are referenced

167
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
i should probably begin to

168
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,959
anticipate when i'm going to change and

169
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,760
give you a heads up

170
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,680
we lost the connection

171
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,079
do you have a network

172
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,270
oh no momento

173
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,340
[Music]

174
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,839
okay

175
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,480
i can tell you there's a list of bcps on

176
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
this next thing and it covers things

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,399
like our anti-harassment policy

178
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,399
our intellectual property intellectual

179
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,880
property processes

180
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,839
this is not loud

181
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,560
all right

182
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,959
let me do it

183
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,800
okay hold on one second

184
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
no

185
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,120
it's not

186
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,680
that's not their problem

187
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,199
before i did

188
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,360
okay

189
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,040
okay so now we return you to where we

190
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,880
were this is the list of best current

191
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
practices or bcps uh that we have it

192
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,800
includes the things like the stan oh

193
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
sorry go ahead you can ask the dumb

194
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
question if you could define vcp for us

195
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,200
best current practice

196
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,079
so

197
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,000
just as a slight tangent if you look at

198
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
the

199
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
ietf

200
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
types of documents we have standards

201
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
track we have informational we have

202
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,839
experimental and sometimes a draft will

203
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,399
be labeled as a best current practice it

204
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,079
might be a best current practice about a

205
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,920
technology or it might be a best current

206
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
practice for

207
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,920
how the ietf operates

208
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,160
so

209
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,240
anyhow so that's our list of uh policies

210
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,200
if you go the next slide

211
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,120
so these specifically are the newcomer

212
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,560
activities uh for this ietf uh this is

213
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,160
the newcomers overview tutorial which

214
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
you are currently

215
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
attending

216
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,160
the uh

217
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,920
there is a quick connections today at

218
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,079
four o'clock uh there is a sign up

219
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,240
process for that we strongly encourage

220
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,480
you to attend that it's it's

221
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,079
it's sort of like a quick meeting with a

222
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,920
bunch of iutfer so you walk around a

223
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,120
room

224
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,800
and you spend a few minutes talking to

225
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,480
some experienced ietfers and then you

226
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,079
move on to another group

227
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,399
we've had pretty good success with that

228
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,920
tomorrow evening we have a newcomers

229
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,000
dinner that's also a sign up you should

230
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,079
have gotten an email about that if

231
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,240
you're not getting the newcomers emails

232
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,000
i strongly encourage you to see the lady

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,279
in purple at the front of the room she

234
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,720
didn't know i was going to point her out

235
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
but there she is

236
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,079
she's going to be helping with some of

237
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,040
the newcomer activities going forward

238
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,920
and so if you're not getting the

239
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,519
newcomer emails please see michelle

240
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,920
uh there is a remote newcomers coffee

241
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,959
break one of the things that we're

242
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,279
really struggling with as are a lot of

243
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,399
uh activities is how to incorporate how

244
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,880
to blend our in-person and our remote

245
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,639
attendees and how to make the experience

246
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,639
beneficial for both of them

247
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,320
and i will have to admit i think we're

248
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,760
struggling a bit with the remote we

249
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,519
really aren't quite exactly sure how to

250
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,839
best serve the remote newcomers

251
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,000
um so we do plan to have a coffee break

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
for them and for you all for those of

253
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,160
you who are remote um

254
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,399
in gather i know there's more details in

255
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,920
that in the newcomers email that you

256
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,279
should have received

257
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,040
we're going to do an oncom

258
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
on-site newcomers feedback session on

259
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,279
thursday morning

260
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,880
there will be a little bit of food there

261
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,760
so

262
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,160
you can come for that

263
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,279
and then we're going to do a remote

264
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,880
newcomers feedback session and it's not

265
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,240
just for remote people but we're just

266
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,600
going to do a follow-up session that's

267
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,639
going to be online strictly online

268
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,839
and we'll do that in the next couple

269
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,199
weeks and we'll get that scheduled and

270
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,639
sent out next slide

271
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,959
so with that i'm going to hand over to

272
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,079
rich and he's going to talk about the

273
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,560
structure of the ietf

274
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,880
okay take a breath thanks

275
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,519
next

276
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,480
all right so the mission of the ietf we

277
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,079
have a mission statement like everybody

278
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,519
does these days

279
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,079
we want to make the internet work better

280
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,320
and what that means is we're going to

281
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,639
produce we want to produce high quality

282
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,480
technically relevant documents that

283
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
means if somebody technically relevant

284
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,600
means if somebody has an idea on how to

285
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,079
get more effective use of car braking

286
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,680
systems that's probably not relevant to

287
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
the itf

288
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,240
but it does cover a fairly wide area

289
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,560
for example there's a recent flurry of

290
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
activity about drones

291
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,480
you know the little flying things that

292
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,800
people record the videos on

293
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,600
because the faa is interested in

294
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,920
identifying them securely

295
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,440
being able to control them keep them

296
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,920
away from sensitive areas like airports

297
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,160
and so on so people in the itf are

298
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,759
working on

299
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,440
drip

300
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,480
drone remote identification protocol

301
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,600
it involves some interesting

302
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
cryptography challenges how you fit a

303
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,959
signature into a small packet that can

304
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,680
be sent over radio things like that

305
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,040
and we want to influence the way people

306
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,600
design use and manage the internet uh in

307
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,079
the past that was more of a selling job

308
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,320
but now there are people

309
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,079
other organizations recognize that if

310
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,600
you want to do something

311
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,519
internet related and it's a technical

312
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,639
protocol

313
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,320
this is the place to be

314
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,399
so

315
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,000
newcomers welcome

316
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,560
next slide

317
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
so we are in what's called an sdo with

318
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,519
standards development organization

319
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,079
we're different than many many other

320
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,759
sdos

321
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,360
lots of them for example iso

322
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,440
or osi depending on how you want to

323
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,519
abbreviate it

324
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,199
there's membership is based on your

325
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,279
country of origin

326
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,079
and it's paid membership

327
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,880
the itf anybody can join all you have to

328
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,920
do is sign up on this website called the

329
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,560
data tracker

330
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,720
datatracker.ietf.org or dt.iatf.org

331
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
everyone here if you registered you

332
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,759
already had an account

333
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,079
you already created an account

334
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,079
self-selected membership is based on

335
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,240
individuals so you don't see things like

336
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,519
when the c plus standard is reviewed the

337
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,040
vote tallies are china says yes u.s says

338
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,959
yes russia says

339
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,160
abstains and so on it's by individuals

340
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
we also don't vote and we'll talk about

341
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,039
that a little later well we do have um

342
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,559
consensus our goal is rough consensus

343
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,760
which means

344
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,599
that we want to make sure that

345
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,160
everyone's had a chance to say but not

346
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,839
that everyone's

347
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,599
you know everyone's voice has been heard

348
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,839
but not that everyone gets to

349
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,000
veto every single decision

350
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,959
um the real the primary driver yeah

351
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,439
yeah please

352
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,720
um

353
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,919
a couple of ways the one let's see lee

354
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,160
the woman in white um

355
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,760
the membership fee here there's some

356
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,600
membership fees right you you join the

357
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
ietf by subscribing to mailing lists of

358
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,280
the groups you're interested in the

359
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,440
conference fees pay for a lot of pay for

360
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,919
some of it we get significant grants

361
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,760
from the internet society

362
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
because the internet society knows that

363
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,160
without the itf the internet is much

364
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,600
less of the thing

365
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,720
and now the iatf also the itif is a

366
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,120
legal entity underneath the internet

367
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,799
society but a separate legal entity in

368
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,880
terms of tax um

369
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,360
and lee is in the development leads is

370
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,200
the development organization which is

371
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,919
responsible for you know seeking grants

372
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,679
if you look on the

373
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,640
um

374
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,400
banners they're hanging up around the

375
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,760
place you'll see several companies

376
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,480
recognized oracle uh

377
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,760
contributes money to help fund

378
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,880
sustainability my company and i forget

379
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
the other one uh

380
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,799
diversity and inclusion

381
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,240
so if you have onsite we have on-site

382
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,799
child care which is funded out of that

383
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,280
so it's corporate contributions on the

384
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,600
global sponsors are people who've signed

385
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,120
up for significant contributions to host

386
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
the ietf meetings which are three times

387
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,840
around the world uh per year uh made

388
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,039
significant contributions to fund that

389
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,559
answer your question

390
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,720
great um

391
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,320
the one thing i would just point uh

392
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,360
mention

393
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,840
is um

394
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
not about funding actually but about

395
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,760
process um

396
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,280
and this this

397
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
i almost hate to do this but uh for the

398
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,559
rest of the meetings this week if you

399
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,840
have any questions if you can go to the

400
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,679
queue and put yourself in the queue in

401
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,160
this room and this is this is a friendly

402
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,640
group a friendly uh

403
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,039
introduction to newcomers event but the

404
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,480
the way the other meetings will work is

405
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,919
you'll need to get in the queue in order

406
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,520
to ask any questions

407
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,039
so um

408
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,760
i i hesitated to do that

409
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,559
but

410
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,080
uh i think you're smiling behind your

411
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,360
mask

412
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,559
yeah okay um yeah when so

413
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,200
the the video system we use is called is

414
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,720
we call it meat echo it's by a company

415
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,160
called meat echo

416
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,799
it's very well integrated into the itf

417
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,880
processes and even

418
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,640
so remote that's what you use it's a

419
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
browser-based application

420
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,960
online there's the online what is it in

421
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,520
person version which is meat echo light

422
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,960
it doesn't bother doing the video and

423
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,160
the audio because you're here in the

424
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,080
room but in the upper left hand corner

425
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,640
there's like a raise your hand icon and

426
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
so if you want to speak at any of the

427
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,520
other sessions

428
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,799
um you click on the raise your hand and

429
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,039
the chairs up front here will manage the

430
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,280
cube because that same cue is also for

431
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,879
people who are watching it remotely

432
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,760
okay uh next slide please

433
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,840
so the big picture

434
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,919
the iesg

435
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,840
you may have heard that term also the

436
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,559
term int area directors

437
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,480
these are the people responsible for

438
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,120
steering the technical direction of the

439
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,200
ietf as in what the different working

440
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,520
groups do and work on

441
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,120
creating new working groups and so on

442
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,480
that process

443
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
they also

444
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,039
approve the decisions

445
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,158
for where we meet

446
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,039
the irsg related to the

447
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,000
internet tech task force ietf there's

448
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,080
the internet engineering

449
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,640
internet research task force and they

450
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,720
have similar kinds of meetings um

451
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,039
they're all co-located here if you

452
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,039
register and attend an ietf meeting you

453
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,480
can attend any of the irtf sessions

454
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,159
and so there are things there about

455
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,280
privacy

456
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,760
uh how you measure the global

457
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,440
consumption of the you know global use

458
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
of the internet and things like that

459
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
the internet architecture board is sort

460
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,640
of an

461
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,039
oversight committee

462
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,679
they held handle the liaison program so

463
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,679
there are lots of organizations that

464
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,120
liaison with the ietf

465
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,480
iso itu has uh interactions you know

466
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,880
they define new signature schemes uh

467
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,039
working with nist post quantum that

468
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,840
stuff all has particular liaisons uh

469
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,320
many of the ietf protocols don't use you

470
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,880
know we've grown outgrown ascii so now

471
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,799
we use unicode and so there's a

472
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,480
particular person associated who

473
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,039
liaisons with the unicode consortium to

474
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,640
make sure that what we're doing is okay

475
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,880
and so on and we just lost the net again

476
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,960
one of the other things ea iab does is

477
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,120
they organize workshops um they've

478
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
announced two

479
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,240
uh one that's coming up uh will be

480
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,360
announced soon is on sustainability and

481
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,960
the applicability

482
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,039
of you know

483
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,039
what happens you know

484
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,880
sustainability within the itf in the

485
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
internet uh how do things change when we

486
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
all are doing zoom rather than flying

487
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,600
all around the world to attend places

488
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,360
i'm glad it's not just me

489
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,760
well i'm not glad but you know yeah

490
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,240
that's right

491
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,158
again sorry

492
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,600
all right i'll

493
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,679
mention the list i'll mention the areas

494
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,880
while we get back up

495
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,440
the technical side of the ietf is

496
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,840
divided is divided into

497
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,640
seven main areas

498
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,120
one two three four five six seven

499
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,320
next slide

500
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,840
okay so

501
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,760
the um

502
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,440
every working group which is where the

503
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,120
bulk of the which is where the bulk of

504
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,039
the technical work happens

505
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,600
falls under a particular area very very

506
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,000
rarely a working group will be respond

507
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,960
will be the responsibility of two areas

508
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,080
but the

509
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,200
largest

510
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,440
parceling of working groups

511
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,320
are is in areas and these are the

512
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,279
seven of them um i won't

513
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,520
read the list

514
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,840
that's why the network crashed um i

515
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,520
won't read the list this is

516
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
not that bad but we would call this an

517
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
eye chart right because you got to sit

518
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,200
there and try to make out little things

519
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,919
but

520
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,679
if you go to the data tracker site you

521
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,480
can find the list of areas

522
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,440
next slide

523
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,039
itef and

524
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,200
consensus so we work by consensus rough

525
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
consensus and running code that's one of

526
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,679
the aphorisms that the iatf likes to use

527
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,679
to describe itself

528
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,919
as i mentioned before rough consensus

529
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,159
doesn't mean that every objection has

530
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,440
been

531
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,600
mollified but that every objection has

532
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,960
been heard

533
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,559
rough consensus all the disease

534
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,840
addressed

535
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,520
dissenting opinions are heard but not

536
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
controlling

537
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,400
and we do what we do humming

538
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,840
like every other thing in the ietf it's

539
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,559
documented in our in an rfc

540
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,679
rfcs originally stood for re request for

541
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,279
comments

542
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,600
dates back 30 years back when the

543
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,760
department us department of defense was

544
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,919
doing things and some grad students said

545
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,000
well here's the way the computer will

546
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,799
talk to the gateways would we call it

547
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,240
let's put it out as a request for

548
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,279
comments

549
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,200
and so we like to still keep that sense

550
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,120
of history

551
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,679
humming is the way we do it uh so

552
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,000
we can do a sort of a practice hum here

553
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
so you can see how it works when it's

554
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,679
all remote

555
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,159
there's a tool in the medico thing that

556
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,720
lets you you know hum yes or no but the

557
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,360
humming has its advantages um you can't

558
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,440
tell who's humming generally especially

559
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
not with people are masked

560
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,279
you can't control

561
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,520
the sound but you know it's really hard

562
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,200
to hum very loud

563
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
um

564
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,600
and you can you typically the chairs

565
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,840
will ask you know a quad three-part

566
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
question

567
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,200
do you think we should adopt this

568
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,440
document do you not think we should

569
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,919
adopt this document are you unable to

570
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,440
decide

571
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,159
so

572
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,880
for example we can say

573
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
uh well that will do a three-part hum

574
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
you know

575
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
do you like karen more than me do you

576
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,720
like me more than karen or are you not

577
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,400
ready to decide yet

578
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,880
so home now if you prefer karen to me

579
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,360
okay

580
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,039
hum now if you prefer me to karen

581
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,200
i'm crushed i'm

582
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,240
hum now if you can't decide

583
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,840
all right so we can all hear that in the

584
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,520
room that was clearly the consensus by

585
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,120
the end of the meeting maybe we'll do it

586
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,000
again okay next

587
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,799
okay next slide

588
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,480
i'll just point out i have candy

589
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
okay so let's talk about the week um

590
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,959
yeah i'm not above it

591
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,760
my suitcase upstairs

592
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,760
but um okay so the week um

593
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
we're still obviously feeling our way

594
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,840
through a lot of this stuff

595
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,159
um this is the second time we've had

596
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,640
both in-person and remote attendance we

597
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,240
call it obviously everyone like everyone

598
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
we call it a hybrid meeting so there's

599
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,600
probably still a little rough edges um

600
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
but the core of the the meeting this

601
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,559
week

602
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,640
and most of the work starts monday

603
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,840
through

604
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,760
late afternoon friday

605
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,080
are working group sessions the itf is

606
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,440
divided into working groups there's

607
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,520
about 130 of them

608
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,400
every one grouped into an area

609
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,480
my particular focus is on security for

610
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,399
example

611
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,080
there are also what's called birds of a

612
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,960
feather sessions boss

613
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,120
they are like well let's get together

614
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,880
and see and maybe if there's enough

615
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,640
interest we'll propose a new working

616
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,039
group in a particular area sometimes it

617
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,000
happens uh sometimes it doesn't happen i

618
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,559
think you're leaving above right on jose

619
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,360
on

620
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,480
signatures in in

621
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,320
json-based signatures i forget the thing

622
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,000
but that's that's close enough you can

623
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,360
find them they're all listed in the

624
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,000
agenda um sometimes it doesn't we had a

625
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,720
buff that was like let's discuss

626
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,200
internet file systems think things like

627
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,880
dropbox google drive and so on and

628
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,960
the conclusion at the end of that was

629
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,399
well we don't have anything to

630
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,159
contribute and none of the people like

631
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,960
dropbox and google drive are here so we

632
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,520
could do a spec but nobody would use it

633
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,440
and that goes against one of our core

634
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,159
tenants which is the best specifications

635
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,159
of those that are used

636
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,399
there are area-wide sessions the biggest

637
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,320
area being

638
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,080
the plenary latin word meeting all of us

639
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
that's for administrative stuff the

640
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,159
different groups that i mentioned at the

641
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,440
beginning the

642
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,960
iesg the iab will present about what's

643
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,760
new the corporate parent

644
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,679
the ietf

645
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,840
limited liability corporation called the

646
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,720
llc will present on the

647
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
finances

648
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,559
nominating committee of which i am the

649
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,080
chair will say hey

650
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,679
you should try out for these positions

651
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,000
and things like that um sometimes

652
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,320
there's a technical presentation

653
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,520
uh not this time there are also there's

654

tickets are available when you

660
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,080
registered if you don't have one you can

661
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,600
post on the mailing list saying anybody

662
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,679
got a special social ticket

663
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,679
common use of the attendees list

664
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,880
um

665
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,440
the irtf meets those are

666
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,679
research focused things on private

667
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,279
things like privacy

668
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,320
uh cryptographic research

669
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,720
what do we do about post-quantum crypto

670
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,240
a lot of cryptographers are involved in

671
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,919
the itf

672
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,080
uh there's a hackathon which was mainly

673
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,720
yesterday and is winding down today so

674
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
next time around consider coming earlier

675
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,279
if you have code that implements

676
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,279
some of the itf specs

677
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,360
bring it work with your colleagues

678
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,039
competitors and make sure everything

679
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,279
interoperates it's a it's a great event

680
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,399
it's free

681
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,440
with your ietf registration

682
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,279
you get a second t-shirt

683
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,320
it's cool

684
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,200
um

685
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,919
tutorials deep dives there's uh

686
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,240
i forget when it is but there is a

687
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,120
technical presentation by our host on

688
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,679
tuesday tuesday

689
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,240
hot rfc in this case

690
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,559
deliberate but rfc stands for request

691
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,240
for conversation

692
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,200
uh the host of that is remote people

693
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
have videotaped a 10-minute presentation

694
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,640
that says

695
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,120
i think we should

696
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,039
figure out how to do signatures so cars

697
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,480
can talk to each other so they don't

698
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,320
crash

699
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,840
so pretty they'll present for a few

700
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,520
minutes if you're interested you go out

701
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,120
and follow up with them afterwards it's

702
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,080
very kind of neat there's side meetings

703
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,919
which are after the regular sessions

704
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,919
where anybody can sign up

705
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,919
in the mailings if you look there's a

706
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,360
wiki

707
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,120
where people can sign up and say i want

708
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,559
to have a side meeting to talk about

709
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,399
whatever it is that might be of interest

710
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,480
it's sort of like a informal buff but

711
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,320
not really

712
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,200
um then there's open time between the

713
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,559
sessions

714
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,440
uh

715
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,279
there's you know we serve the breakfast

716
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,919
i'm disappointed it's more than just

717
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,399
starchy old pastries but during

718
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,000
breakfast what's called the hallway

719
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,760
track right you can bump in and meet

720
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,600
people and talk to them and that's a

721
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,240
very important part and beneficial part

722
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,320
of the face-to-face meetings next

723
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,480
the working group sessions this is a

724
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,360
picture from the before times right

725
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,279
we can see the back of everyone's head

726
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,919
but nowadays everyone is masked

727
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,240
most work is done on mailing lists every

728
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,440
working group

729
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,960
like i said there's over 100 of them has

730
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,519
its own mailing list just join

731
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,200
read for a while

732
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,200
if you go to the data tracker site

733
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,720
dt.ietf.org is the shorthand name you

734
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,399
can search for a working group and see

735
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,799
what documents they're working on

736
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,640
you can subscribe to the mailing list

737
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,679
you can

738
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,039
search the mailing list and find

739
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,880
comments that people have made once

740
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,360
you're caught up to speed

741
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
and and feel comfortable talking about

742
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,799
something because you read the documents

743
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,440
or you read previous drafts

744
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,000
feel free to you know speak up

745
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,159
using the the meet echo tool or

746
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,799
or post on the mailing list okay

747
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,080
no problem

748
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,000
most of the work is done on the mailing

749
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,320
list and what's different about ietf

750
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,279
meetings

751
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,360
working group meetings uh from many

752
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,600
other standards organizations is someone

753
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
will stand up

754
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,000
and their slides which will be

755
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,519
just a bullet list but without the

756
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,480
picture

757
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,399
because it's all just text

758
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,399
you know here's what changed since the

759
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,879
last time

760
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,200
here's the issue that we still have to

761
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,600
resolve four or five bullets or two or

762
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,279
three bullets

763
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,799
if you don't know what happened last

764
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,720
time then you're going to be lost

765
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,360
so one good way an important way to

766
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,120
prepare for the working groups that

767
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,559
you're interested in is look through the

768
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,880
documents scan them

769
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,000
skim the ones that you're most

770
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,919
interested in so that when somebody

771
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,200
stands up

772
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,000
and speaks in some cases at a very very

773
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,159
rapid clip unfortunately

774
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,760
okay so what we did last time is we

775
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,399
changed the packet size from 128 to 256

776
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,840
okay

777
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,679
uh yeah sure but anyhow um it's a

778
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,440
presentation of the diffs of what

779
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,760
happened what changed and the things

780
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,120
that are now open issues that the

781
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,559
working group has to decide about

782
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,720
the sessions are all streamed and

783
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,519
recorded using the meat echo tool

784
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,320
in addition they are also available on

785
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
our youtube channel after the fact and

786
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,799
it takes a couple days to upload

787
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,279
everything

788
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,960
the working group what the working group

789
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,919
works on is called the charter

790
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,120
and that is

791
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,200
negotiated with the relevant area

792
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,799
director and the working group chairs

793
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,960
next

794
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,039
birds of a feather session

795
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,039
person's not masked but

796
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:57,840
uh

797
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,960
usually a working group has a baf first

798
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,559
and they will say things like working

799
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,480
group forming buff or non-working group

800
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,200
forming buff there's probably discussion

801
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,480
of the proposed charter what's

802
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,079
interesting let's see who shows up at

803
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,239
that meeting and they're scheduled

804
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,918
during the regular ietf sessions

805
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,520
just to see who's interested and if it's

806
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,440
worth trying to progress and it's up to

807
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,040
the area directors

808
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,119
approved by the iesg

809
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,480
to make those decisions

810
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,719
bath meets once

811
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,480
irtf

812
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,239
the folks here the young men here uh

813
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,199
one

814
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,280
one of the things the irtf does is give

815
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,119
out a prize for the best networking

816
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,719
oriented paper

817
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,280
um so there's one on

818
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,918
coming up on fingerprinting i think this

819
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,399
year how you can tell what a site is

820
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,719
doing by looking at the order in which

821
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,199
the records appear in tls as i recall

822
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,599
another is on looking at the various

823
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,639
costs

824
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,079
cpu costs of encrypting dns protocols

825
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,079
they meet irtf meets during part of the

826
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,119
regular ietf session the irtf open

827
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,400
session is where

828
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,440
the

829
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,320
best research papers are presented and

830
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,200
they get

831
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,280
you know accommodations to come and a

832
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,480
stipend

833
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,400
and usually it's graduate students right

834
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,720
working and so a thousand bucks means a

835
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,640
lot to them

836
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,079
there is a primer

837
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,119
rfc 7418

838
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,280
that explains what the irtf does but you

839
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,119
can sort of

840
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,839
catch it up by context next

841
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,079
can can i just

842
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,400
can i just interject one thing here um

843
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,920
when you're looking at the ie at the

844
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,240
schedule uh you'll see the research

845
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,760
groups this week you will also see anrw

846
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,960
which is the advanced network and

847
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,640
research workshop

848
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,119
the and that those uh have been papers

849
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,720
that have been selected to come so it's

850
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,040
a parallel activity to the ietf that's

851
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,359
generally done once a year and it's on

852
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,760
the agenda this week it's also done

853
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,560
in conjunction with the irtf

854
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,359
so

855
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,880
i would look for both of those for

856
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,720
potential research topics um and i just

857
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,320
wanted to be sure that that was great

858
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,680
yeah and

859
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,359
the anrw is actually an acm workshop so

860
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,359
it's got you know real credentials and

861
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,040
presumably it's a lot harder to get

862
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,960
papers though right and the uh anrp the

863
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,040
prize where they present their work

864
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
that's paper papers that have already

865
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,359
been published in other venues

866
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,000
uh that are then nominated as a topic

867
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,480
that might be of interest to the ietf

868
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,520
um and i don't remember when the call

869
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,200
for that is but every year there's a

870
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,640
call

871
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,560
and a set of nominations i think we have

872
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
an anrp

873
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,960
presenter in here for this so

874
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,079
um

875
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,640
but anyway so the uh if you if you are

876
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,680
an academic um in addition to

877
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,800
using the anrw as a means to present

878
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,599
your work to publish your work you can

879
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,359
also present work that you've published

880
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,480
elsewhere through the anrp

881
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,400
a r yeah anrp right a rp a rw the ietf

882
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,440
loves its

883
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,720
tlas

884
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,640
flies okay

885
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,920
um

886
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,240
birds no wrong correction okay the

887
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,839
area-wide sessions so almost many areas

888
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,520
have um

889
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,119
pardon me a session

890
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:27,920
for

891
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,599
all of the groups to come

892
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,000
within their area uh they will and

893
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,920
there's two kinds there is the general

894
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,359
area session so they'll be like

895
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,560
transport

896
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,079
here's where each of the working groups

897
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,599
gives a two sentence summary of what's

898
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,520
happened or what will be happening at

899
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
their thing

900
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,960
and then there's also dispatch

901
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,480
there might be an invited speaker

902
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,599
sometimes

903
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,839
then there's also dispatch

904
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,920
there's various dispatch groups where

905
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,760
somebody comes up and says

906
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,800
this is something in the

907
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,359
transport area i have a new version of

908
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,920
how gateways talk to each other

909
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,400
where should i go with it um and the

910
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,240
dispatch the people who go to dispatch

911
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,280
the transport dispatch or the art

912
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,040
applications dispatch or the sec

913
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,280
dispatch for security will figure out

914
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,880
and they can make a couple of decisions

915
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,960
one an area director should just support

916
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,359
it we should consider creating a whole

917
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,599
new work group or oh well you're new to

918
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,280
the ietf with new work and you probably

919
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,079
didn't realize that this group over here

920
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,640
is working on gateway interactions so

921
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,440
you

922
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,119
go to them and see if they want to work

923
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,200
on you know adopt your draft

924
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,400
um

925
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,320
plenary as i said is

926
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,920
the whole group it meets a lot of

927
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,520
administrative stuff

928
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
um

929
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,320
a lot of you know interest here's the

930
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,640
financial breakdown here are here's the

931
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,760
corp the country breakdown of attendees

932
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,200
here's how it compares to the previous

933
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,880
time you know lots of interesting

934
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,359
administrative administrivia i guess is

935
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,480
the term

936
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,839
um invited lunch talks there's a

937
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,839
part of the emo door has a working group

938
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,000
chair lunch for all of the working group

939
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,040
chairs to

940
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
get together and talk and say well you

941
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,720
know this is a problem one thing the

942
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,200
ietf has done for example in the past

943
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,000
couple of years is much more embracing

944
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,200
of github

945
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,839
the open source platform and so there's

946
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,520
often discussion about how to handle

947
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,320
that there is no as you might expect an

948
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,760
rfc on how to use github but

949
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,280
you know github is one of the places

950
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,119
where developers congregate so we want

951
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,599
to be where the developers are to to get

952
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,160
their feedback and so on

953
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,599
next

954
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,520
hackathons so this

955
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,599
was

956
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,160
again pre-pandemic picture it's also

957
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,520
they also do it remote during the week

958
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,200
but it's a place to work on new

959
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,520
protocols

960
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,800
quick a secure transport protocol they

961
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,520
had several hackathons where they people

962
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,800
were working on different versions of

963
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,400
the draft and they want to make sure by

964
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
the time the rfc is done

965
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
that

966
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,800
a it's possible to implement this thing

967
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,760
b it's not crazy stupid and doesn't

968
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,079
require all of your cpu to just ship a

969
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,040
packet

970
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,240
and see that it works across a whole

971
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,640
bunch of different implementations

972
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,280
tls did the same thing dns is doing the

973
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,960
same thing so there's a lot

974
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,440
right now there's a research project

975
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,680
going on about how you do multicast

976
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,359
where you know you can do point-to-point

977
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,200
or you can do broadcast everybody on the

978
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,640
net but

979
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,240
over the general internet you want to be

980
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,440
able to do multicast let me send one

981
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,760
for example let me send one copy

982
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,160
of the packets for this movie to an

983
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,599
entire apartment building because

984
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,839
they're all watching it or a major

985
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,920
sporting event the premier league the us

986
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,160
super bowl uh because everybody's

987
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,680
watching it so it's much more efficient

988
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,839
for me to just send it once

989
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,560
next

990
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,680
uh the hackathon uh anyone can attend

991
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,920
you get free food another free t-shirt

992
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,000
um the idea is to flush out things and

993
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,079
everybody brings what they do back to

994
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,480
their respective working groups um and

995
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,319
there's often a mini presentation within

996
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,760
the working group that says hey here's

997
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,680
what happened in the past few days

998
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,720
um it we do get developers we get many

999
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,880
people who come only for the hackathon

1000
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,040
because it's zero cost

1001
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,359
we get a lot of academics

1002
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,319
or student you know and or students

1003
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,560
it's a mix of people veterans newcomers

1004
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
and so on it's a really good time

1005
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,480
uh and until the weekend you know

1006
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,960
yesterday and today so too late but next

1007
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,720
time

1008
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,079
and there's an rfc coming out that

1009
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,760
describes how to run one of these things

1010
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,640
you might expect social events uh on the

1011
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,839
left side the big blue was held at the

1012
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,240
singapore national aquarium

1013
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,200
it was kind of cool you know

1014
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,720
there was no sushi serve but there are

1015
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,680

1016
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,960
um on the right is

1017

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,440
um

1022
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,839
a local community no a community of

1023
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,520
people uh of women uh support because of

1024
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,119
you know as you can tell obviously in

1025
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,200
tech

1026
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,400
they're not not as well supported

1027
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,359
there's more um side meetings we haven't

1028
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,680
figured out quite the agenda

1029
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,640
they're not

1030
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
official ietf meetings but they should

1031
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,119
follow the same rules they're not stream

1032
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,520
video unless someone opens up their

1033
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,680
laptop and does their own uses their own

1034
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,800
zoom meet google me discord

1035
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,520
blue jeans webex i think i can name them

1036
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,680
all all the ones i know about all the

1037
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,839
ones that are on my machine

1038
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,839
but they're not officially part of the

1039
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,160
ietf multimedia experience

1040
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,599
there is a deep dive on quick

1041
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,839
tuesday morning i guess before breakfast

1042
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,040
is served

1043
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,640
and then there's a blog post that talks

1044
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
about new topics that are new to the

1045
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,480
ietf this time

1046
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,720
and so on

1047
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,720
i think i'm done oh meeting etiquette

1048
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,400
okay

1049
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,000
it really helps to read the documents of

1050
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,680
the groups you're interested in you can

1051
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,839
also just sit back and listen and maybe

1052
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,319
you'll be lost sometimes

1053
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,960
integrated with meat echo is the zulu

1054
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,240
chat system

1055
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,640
it's a test text

1056
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,560
instant messaging system like

1057
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,200
jabber or slack

1058
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,760
but you know different and better

1059
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,560
um we want to be respectful and tolerant

1060
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,920
of everybody

1061
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,000
uh we don't want to you know we want to

1062
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,520
make sure everyone feels welcome and

1063
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,400
able to contribute or judge solely based

1064
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,200
on you know your technical contributions

1065
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,359
have a good time it's a real pain to

1066
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,560
walk around

1067
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,480
mast all the time go out get some fresh

1068
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,520
air

1069
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,119
and then realize whoa it's way too hot

1070
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,319
out there and come back inside

1071
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,880
okay um

1072
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,680
yeah so the online version you can't

1073
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,480
quite see it but

1074
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,560
there

1075
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,200
is a raise your hand so in any of the

1076
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,359
other sessions if you want to talk

1077
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,880
you can ask questions while someone's

1078
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,400
presenting generally people will present

1079
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,079
there's an agenda with you know time

1080
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,040
limits

1081
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,560
then there will be a time for general

1082
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,319
question and answer or things like hey

1083
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,560
did you consider that you know

1084
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,319
motorcycles need to be able to avoid

1085
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,760
cars too

1086
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,359
um

1087
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,720
you know going back to hyper effective

1088
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,400
example

1089
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,319
the local version turns off the audio

1090
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,079
and video

1091
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,040
uh

1092
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,440
remote you know use headsets sort of all

1093
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,880
of the standard video conferencing

1094
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,839
things that we've gotten too tired of uh

1095
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,760
comments and questions are welcome

1096
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,160
um don't say you know

1097
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,839
i couldn't hear you with the mask you

1098
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,000
know try to speak slowly

1099
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,280
state your name uh when you speak and

1100
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,960
you'll come up to the mic when the chair

1101
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,200
recognizes you um

1102
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,960
because

1103
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,280
people taking the minutes uh don't know

1104
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,960
everybody's name it's especially hard to

1105
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,880
hear with them see some recognize

1106
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,200
somebody with the mask on

1107
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,560
there's an integrated chat

1108
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,839
that's also gateway to and from the

1109
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,640
zulip chat system

1110
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,119
so that there's text messaging available

1111
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,960
sometimes it's a snarky back channel

1112
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,560
sometimes it's a really good place to

1113
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,599
ask clarifying questions of the room

1114
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,280
it all depends on the on the working

1115
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,440
group

1116
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,000
briefly how to bring new work uh

1117
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,150
there um

1118
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,480
[Music]

1119
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,800
before you have a baff even before you

1120
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,319
know you can just go to someone hey i'm

1121
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,119
really concerned about this um it might

1122
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,240
be worth

1123
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,640
writing up something a draft every

1124
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,520
document in the itf starts out and we

1125
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,680
call it an internet draft

1126
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,240
id or generally a draft

1127
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,680
drafts

1128
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,640
are the product of working groups

1129
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,720
you can submit an individual draft all

1130
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,800
done through the data tracker

1131
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,680
if you go to the

1132
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,040
authors.ihf.org website

1133
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,280
there is some tutorial information on

1134
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,359
how to format your document and the

1135
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,520
tooling available to sort of get it all

1136
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,520
nice and pretty and make the html look

1137

good or the pdf or what have you

1138

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,359
you can see it

1140
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,560
there

1141
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,560
on the links these slides will be

1142
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,160
available

1143
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,000
and also you can find out

1144
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,240
how

1145
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,119
we have a question

1146
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,280
is that what that means

1147
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,880
it means that carl is in the queue is

1148
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,960
carl clear or remote come on join the

1149
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,240
queue yeah

1150
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,760
excellent i was hoping somebody would

1151
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,760
demonstrate this right

1152
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,800
yeah i

1153
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,440
hi karl klatsky i partially just wanted

1154
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,040
to try it make sure it worked for the

1155
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,640
real meetings

1156
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,400
but my other quick question is is there

1157
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,720
anyone around uh for in-person help on

1158
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,560
the data tracker account

1159
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,119
apparently i had an account from a few

1160
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,359
years back and had ids linked to it but

1161
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,680
then my email changed and i got the

1162
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,799
right message sure

1163
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,280
a little bit later in there there's an

1164
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,160
email address support at iatf.org

1165
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,240
you send an email to that it addresses a

1166
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,079
bunch of issues like things like your

1167
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,079
account

1168
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,680
uh and if that doesn't solve it then

1169
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,079
there's a separate data tracker bug but

1170
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,200
what you're talking about it's not

1171
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,720
really a bug it's an authentication

1172
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,280
issue yeah so all meeting issues go to

1173
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,000
support at ietf.org

1174
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,240
yeah

1175
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,880
okay

1176
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,599
and now we know the queue works and well

1177
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,800
yeah thank you

1178
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,839

next oh wait i'm on the rocks hold on a

1180
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,119
second

1181
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,800
oh so that's me okay

1182
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,520
so i'm doing the fourth part of this

1183
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,680
which is um

1184
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,200
the basically a whole bunch of resources

1185
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,359
and information uh pointers to groups of

1186
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,400
people that would be useful and you're

1187
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,880
going to have to advance my slides

1188
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,760
um

1189
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,280
so uh go backwards one

1190
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,040
so first of all just a short word about

1191
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,200
ietf participants and culture it's a

1192
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
very passionate vocal culture

1193
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,640
but don't be shy be sure to ask

1194
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,000
questions

1195
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,480
because we are all here to help

1196
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,359
technical excellence is highly valued

1197
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,040
you know so if you're working in a field

1198
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,440
and you see some issues be sure to speak

1199
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,400
up

1200
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,839
you know a number of us as you've

1201
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,599
already figured out it's uh informal

1202
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,040
dress code

1203
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,040
so it's not a definitely not a coat and

1204
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,119
tie place and a lot of people here have

1205
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,559
been working with each other for a long

1206
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,960
time and you'll notice that over time

1207
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,839
people

1208
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,839
who participate in the ietf will move

1209
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,280
companies but they'll still maintain

1210
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,040
their ietf participation as they're

1211
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,280
moving from company to company

1212
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,960
so it's a culture that we're fairly

1213
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,640
proud of it's also a culture that we are

1214
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,800
trying to improve by being sure that we

1215
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,200
are as inclusive and

1216
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,960
positive as we can be because sometimes

1217
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,160
the world is

1218
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,760
a negative place

1219
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,400
next slide

1220
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,760
so

1221
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,960
with that

1222
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,200
caveat we do have an ombuds team which

1223
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,400
i'm going to talk about in a little bit

1224
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,240
later we do have an anti-harassment

1225
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,440
policy

1226
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,280
if you are at all concerned about any

1227
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,280
behavior that you witness or experience

1228
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,559
in the ietf uh there's sort of like

1229
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,720
four levels that you can go through uh

1230
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,839
the first one is you can speak to the

1231
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,200
working group chairs in the working

1232
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,280
group that you speak that you are

1233
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,880
concerned about

1234
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,319
or you can go to the area directors

1235
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,920
and then lars eggert is the general

1236
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,599
chair of the ietf

1237
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,280
and then beyond that we have the ombuds

1238
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,480
team if you go to the next slide

1239
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,520
um

1240
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,440
the exact i really should put the ombuds

1241
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,559
team is later in here and i really

1242
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,000
should move it so it's right after that

1243
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,599
slide

1244
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,720
this is what happens when you look at

1245
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,920
the slides but you don't actually

1246
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,240
present them so jay daley is the

1247
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,400
executive director of the ihf so he's

1248
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,839
responsible for all the administrative

1249
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,520
side of the house and keeping everything

1250
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,359
in operations next slide

1251
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,680
the ietf secretariat

1252
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,119
they are the

1253
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,680
staff that are the event planners and do

1254
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,079
all the basic logistics and keep us all

1255
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,200
um in cookies and in t-shirts and in

1256
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,880
rooms with all of the things that they

1257
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,760
do

1258
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,680
there will be a registration desk that's

1259
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,200
staffed all week that'll have people

1260
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,559
there they can ask

1261
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,119
any questions of they are super helpful

1262
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,040
and um

1263
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,400
and they are also they're always there

1264
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,599
for

1265
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,960
a

1266
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,400
friendly smile if you need one which

1267
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,640
sometimes one does need next slide

1268
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,359
uh

1269
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,599
there i'm i did not double check to make

1270
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,520
sure and in the pre-pandemic times there

1271
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,599
were two tables one would be the rfc

1272
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,079
editor staff and one would be the iana

1273
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,520
staff and they would be down somewhere

1274
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,119
in the general area of the registration

1275
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,200
desk these are two functions that are

1276
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,400
key to the work of the ietf the rfc

1277
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,920
editor obviously

1278
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,599
publishes all of our documents so if

1279
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,800
you're trying to get a document through

1280
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,240
and you need to talk to somebody about

1281
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,160
some issue that you're having you can go

1282
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,960
up to their desk and ask them

1283
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,119
and then also the iana staff manages all

1284
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,359
of your protocol number assignments so

1285
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,480
you know if you want to register a

1286
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,359
number you're going to have to go

1287
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,520
through ayanna you have to have an iana

1288
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,599
consideration section in any rfc that

1289
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,440
you might be writing and so you would go

1290
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,440
and speak to the iana staff

1291
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,119
you can also contact them on email but

1292
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,200
sometimes if you're here and in person

1293
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,800
just walking up and talking to somebody

1294
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,400
at least putting a face to a name for

1295
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,359
the staff would be really helpful

1296
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,400
they will have office hours thank you

1297
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,079
both groups will have office hours so

1298
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,680
you can you'll find their tables

1299
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,760
downstairs um and i should have double

1300
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,760
checked that

1301
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,160
next slide

1302
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,839
uh so this is the ombuds team is the

1303
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,200
slide which i will move up in the

1304
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,760
presentation uh so these are long-term

1305
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,640
three long-term ietf participants uh and

1306
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,559
and they're sort of your uh

1307
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,839
your your final arbiters to go to to

1308
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,119
uh

1309
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,760
to uh report any uh behavior that you're

1310
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,280
not happy with or in any way in which

1311
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,319
you feel like

1312
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,160
you're witnessing or experiencing

1313
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,160
harassment in the ietf

1314
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,119
um

1315
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,480
and even if you just want to talk to

1316
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,400
them about you know i'm i'm not sure how

1317
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,720
to deal with this you're not it's not a

1318
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,559
it's not necessarily a formal complaints

1319
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,480
process it's it's a

1320
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,480
a set of it's a set of resources to go

1321
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,520
and talk to

1322
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,599
uh to see about uh how you might improve

1323
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,200
something

1324
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,280
next slide

1325
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,440
so the ietf sisters

1326
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,520
this got mentioned before this is a

1327
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,440
group

1328
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,040
for

1329
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,359
women and people that identify as women

1330
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,760
or non-binary

1331
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,960
and

1332
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,280
the website is there it's it's really a

1333
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,680
very informal group of people uh we do

1334
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,280
get together during the ietf and have

1335
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,559
lunch and i think we have a sister's

1336
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,319
networking event this week which is also

1337
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,559
on the calendar

1338
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,880
and there's a mailing list

1339
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,880
so the number of us

1340
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,839
have been

1341
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,319
participating for a long time

1342
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:05,839
and it's it's just a friendly group of

1343
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,400
people to as a resource to go to

1344
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,119
next slide

1345
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,680
uh data tracker you've heard rich

1346
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,720
mentioned data tracker a lot this week

1347
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,160
if there's one thing that you need to

1348
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,119
learn

1349
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,040
one place you need to get to for the

1350
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,200
ietf it's the data tracker because it

1351
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,160
has

1352
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,240
all of the resources associated with the

1353
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,319
working group it has all of the meetings

1354
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,240
uh it has all the materials and i put

1355
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,559
the tls working group up here and you

1356
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,400
you can't really see it in there but if

1357
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,079
you look at the tab across the top you

1358
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,760
know right underneath the transport

1359
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,559
layer security it says about and then

1360
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,200
documents and meetings

1361
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,839
and uh something i can't read and photos

1362
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,240
and email and the list archive so it has

1363
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,160
all of the artifacts associated with the

1364
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,359
working group

1365
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,000
um if you go to the about tab it'll give

1366
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,720
you who the chairs are what the charter

1367
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,720
is any additional resources that they

1368
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,319
might have identified

1369
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,680
so

1370
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,640
and

1371
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,400
this tool has evolved quite a bit in the

1372
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,000
last few years

1373
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,920
and in fact the code sprint portion of

1374
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,319
the ietf is the tools team basically all

1375
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,680
getting together and doing some extra

1376
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,720
work on the data tracker

1377
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,480
it's getting much better it's highly

1378
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,280
tailored to the work of the ietf

1379
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,680
there is a bug reporting system and and

1380
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,359
there is a tools team so you can even

1381
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,640
follow along in the work that they're

1382
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,640
doing if you're interested in that but

1383
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,160
if you really want to get into the work

1384
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,599
of the ietf you need to spend a little

1385
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,880
bit of time getting familiar with the

1386
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,240
data tracker

1387
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,799
next slide

1388
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,440
increasing people on the queue i don't

1389
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,319
know

1390
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,720
oh i think you can you can take people

1391
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,040
to the

1392
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,920
i guess we

1393
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,280
we'll just go ahead and assume you're

1394
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,760
yeah are you i'm john oh hi john yeah i

1395
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,680
was just wondering if the tools team has

1396
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,760
office hours or if we can ask them

1397
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,240
questions because the tools are

1398
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,400
yeah i don't know if they have office

1399
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,799
hours but um

1400
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,400
wait somebody

1401
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,880
is that an it

1402
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,280
oh

1403
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,559
oh that's a really good idea yeah

1404
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,000
they're at the hackathon

1405
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,599
under the sign that says i think it says

1406
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,599
code sprint right it says code sprint

1407
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,440
that's the tools team

1408
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,960
excellent um

1409
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,359

oh i'm sorry lena i'm sorry i just

1411
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,960

1412
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,000
excellent hi i'm lena uh you mentioned

1413

1414
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,240
networking event on tuesday is it

1415
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,760
something that you have to join and

1416
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,920
pre-register for or you can just show up

1417
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,200
and uh

1418
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,599

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,200
um

1420
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,559
you know we have historically had a sign

1421
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,319
up but i haven't seen one this time but

1422
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,920
i do know there's a sister's lunch so i

1423
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,359
think there's two on the agenda so i

1424
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,359
would say just show up

1425
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,720
but i would join the mailing list

1426
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,720
right and isn't there's a lunch on

1427

1429
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,960

1430
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,520
uh so i would show up this week

1431
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,359
if it is a sign up we can always put one

1432
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,160
one more person in it's just for um

1433
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,480
catering purposes so

1434
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,680
uh

1435
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,880
robert

1436
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,720
yes thank you um

1437
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,559
when i was preparing i found an ios app

1438
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,559
called ietfers

1439
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,480
and i downloaded a bit it seems to be

1440
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,960
pointing back at an older meeting is it

1441
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,960
a newer version

1442
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,720
i don't know the the mobile stuff is is

1443
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,640
taking a hiatus let's say so yeah

1444
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,160
yeah i think it's working okay

1445
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,680
okay thank you

1446
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,960
okay so

1447
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,799
apparently it is working on

1448
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,000
ios but

1449
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,040
us android users are out of luck yeah i

1450
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,640
i think you need she's

1451
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,160
uh she's right i believe you have to

1452
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,280
select the new meeting i'll have to

1453
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,720
admit i haven't actually looked this

1454
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,960
time i usually have it up by now but

1455
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,440
i haven't done it this time um

1456
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,559
i thought there was somebody else in the

1457
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,079
queue but cube

1458
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,720
so the next person is the next slide is

1459
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,839
meat echo so all of the we as

1460
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,839
you know ihf really we really like our

1461
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,240
custom tools and so the next custom tool

1462
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,160
that we have is the the conferencing

1463
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,599
system that we have

1464
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,160
it is web-based

1465
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,000
and it is

1466
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,079
run by a small team of gentlemen that

1467
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,359
are in the knock

1468
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:34,720
there is a

1469
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,319
an additional page that gives you lots

1470
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,480
of information about meat echo for those

1471
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,319
of you on site you're you're not really

1472
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,400
going to be using the full meat echo

1473
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,520
you're going to be using the version on

1474
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,960
your phone that just checks you in and

1475
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,839
puts you in the queue

1476
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,359
and there are also practice sessions for

1477
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,799
any of you that are remote that you can

1478
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,319
use if you go to the next slide

1479
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,280
uh the ietf network you've probably also

1480
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,040
seen like i don't know i mean there

1481
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,799
might be eight or nine ssids that we

1482
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,640
have now we do have our own network here

1483
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,920
that we run

1484
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,280
we deploy

1485
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,920
wireless for all of the meeting rooms

1486
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,040
and then we

1487
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,160
provide

1488
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,640
we don't provide we don't we don't

1489
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,559
substitute out the aps that are in the

1490
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,400
hotel but what we do do

1491
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,599
is we get the hotel to add our

1492
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,920
ssid on there and then it uses our

1493
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,359
uplink

1494
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,839
so we do have a full network team here

1495
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,920
there is a printer along with the help

1496
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,599
desk that is usually staffed by one or

1497
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,880
two of the knock guys one floor down

1498
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,319
so if you need to print anything or if

1499
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,839
you have any network or technical

1500
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,920
questions related to the network

1501
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,480
you can stop and see them

1502
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,680
and that was a picture of them right

1503
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,040
before their morning meeting this

1504
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,480
morning

1505
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,720
next slide

1506
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,920
so there's some additional resources

1507
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,599

[Music]

1544
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,839
yes

1545
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,319
i actually tried to do that like

1546
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,000
walking two different sessions one more

1547
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,880
time

1548
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,240
nope can't do that yeah

1549
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,440
your browser was getting slower and

1550
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,440
slower

1551
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,760
came back

1552
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:45,200

1553
