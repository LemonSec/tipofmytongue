36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,119
by using hedge dock so this is a

37
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
collaborative process and everyone is

38
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,280
welcome to join and contribute to the

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
process of taking minutes

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
and thank you in advance

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,000
and also we might need a jabber or

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,479
perhaps today a zulip scribe

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
as well so if anyone would like to

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,640
volunteer please let us know

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
okay

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,160
and also on the agenda you can find a

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,560
couple of pointers one is the link to

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,599
the online agenda and the other one is

49
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,440
the link to the hedge doc that we are

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,319
using today for taking minutes

51
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,280
so

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,920
next please

53
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,360
so this is the second itf meeting that

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840
has an in-person component since the

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,239
start of the copied endemic

56
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,680
so there are a few

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,879
meeting tips to keep in mind

58
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
so basically they are the same as for

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,440
the last itf for in-person participants

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,879
please make sure to sign into the

61
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,040
session by using meet echo for example

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,360
you may use the on-site tool which is

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,080
available from the data tracker agenda

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
and the very important point is that

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
actually we're going to use miteco

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,519
to manage the cube so if you want to

67
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,920
join the queue please do that through

68
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,480
miteco as there is a single unified q

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
handle in this way

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,959
and also blue sheets are automatically

71
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,599
generated from miteco so please if you

72
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,920
are in the room uh please make sure that

73
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,319
you join me technically

74
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,959
and for remote participants just keep in

75
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,879
mind that you need to keep your audio

76
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,440
video off unless you are presenting

77
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,760
next please

78
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,080
so this is the notewell

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,120
this is a reminder of idf policies on

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,760
various important topics just patents

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
code of conduct and so on

82
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
so if you are not familiar with it

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,760
please make sure that you have read it

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
next please

85
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,599
and this is the agenda proposed for

86
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,720
today

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
so the first presentation is the usual

88
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,720
chess introduction that's currently in

89
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,840
progress

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
this will be followed by a presentation

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
on the status update of the six low use

92
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,920

93
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,120
[Music]

94
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
that will be followed by

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,439
the presentation on the nd multicast

96
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,680
address listener registration draft by

97
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,798
pascal

98
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,720
and a discussion on the next steps for

99
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,000
the draft

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
then

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,000
the next will be the presentation on the

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
transmission of chip compressed packets

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,800
over 15.4 networks and this will be

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
followed by a set of two presentations

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,680
that focus on the native short address

106
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,040
scheme

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,919
the first one is the presentation on the

108
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,320
base document and the second one is a

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
companion document focusing on

110
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,160
reliability considerations that is

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,240
presented for the first time both will

112
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,639
be given by rudy yandone

113
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,080
so as you can see

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,360
the total schedule time is 60 minutes so

115
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
we have a packed agenda also we would

116
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,360
like to kindly ask

117
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,680
request the presenters to try to stick

118
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,440
to the allocated time

119
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,520
and well is there any comment any

120
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,080
question on the agenda

121
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,639
okay so if there are no comments

122
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,680
then

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,919
yeah let's proceed to the

124
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,080
report of the working group document

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
status

126
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,800
so the first document that we have on

127
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
the table is

128
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,280
again the ipv6 over nfc draft

129
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,759
which as you may recall was evaluated by

130
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,880
the asg

131
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
then it was updated after that

132
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,919
and now it has been stuck for two years

133
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,800
now

134
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
so perhaps uh eric if you can

135
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
uh let us know about details about the

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,360
next steps any plans for that

137
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
yeah this is this is my fault i have not

138
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,400
been able to

139
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
prioritize this but uh but i know that i

140
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,600
need to

141
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
i had some discussion with lars i think

142
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,759
and some others and

143
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,400
i think we can just

144
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,840
we can demonstrate that everybody who

145
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,440
had access to this who needed to have

146
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,600
access to the spec uh had access to it

147
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
and also that those that did not it's

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,319
not terribly different from other

149
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
wireless standards

150
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,199
and certainly not from an ipv6 interface

151
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,680
definition so

152
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,639
i think

153
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,560
there's a small

154
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,400
there's some clarifying text to the

155
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
security considerations we might we

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,960
might make

157
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,280
uh and uh probably the right thing to do

158
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,960
is to maybe bring it back to the isg

159
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,000
thank you so uh one clarifying question

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
uh regarding the point of anyone uh who

161
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,479
might like to have access to the

162
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,280
specification does it mean that if

163
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,919
any folks approach the authors who i

164
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
understand at least then they have a

165
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
copy of the specification uh is that

166
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,520
enough or should there be some sort of

167
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,120
announcement or wider broadcast of

168
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,240
uh

169
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,919
how to access the specification

170
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,080
i think the former is probably enough i

171
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,759
think um

172
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,360
uh

173
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
i i don't think

174
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,599
it's uh

175
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
terribly contentious enough or so

176
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,840
terribly uh there's enough uh

177
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,520
interest to warrant

178
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,720
uh

179
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
worrying about spreading the information

180
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,440
and i also don't want to violate any

181
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,199
sort of

182
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,199
the

183
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,440
nfc

184
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,720
sdo their their

185
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
standard distribution

186
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,759
uh orders

187
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
yeah or recommendations so

188
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
okay

189
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,000
uh for those who feel it's necessary for

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,440
review they should be able to review the

191
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,840
essential components i feel that's

192
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,960
fair okay

193
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,240
thank you

194
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,520
so the next document is ipv6 over plc

195
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,560
uh you may recall that uh all the

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,800
discussed ballots have been cleared the

197
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,599
authors updated the draft after that

198
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,440
incorporating the last remaining set of

199
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
comments as well

200
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,479
so

201
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,039
however if i understand it correctly

202
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,160
eric

203
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
there has been some changes in isg

204
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,440
membership so new isg members need to

205
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,639
provide also some ballots right

206
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,000
that's correct we lost some ballot

207
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,759
positions during the changeover and i

208
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,599
failed to advance it prior to that

209
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,520
and so i've sent email uh to their

210
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,680
remaining uh and to the to the new into

211
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,879
the uh to those with no record ballot to

212
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,400
ask uh if we could get uh two more

213
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
reviews i think we only need two more at

214
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,880
this point and then uh or two more no

215
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
objection or yes ballots

216
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,719
uh there are discuss points we'll have

217
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,240
to take care of that but i think we've

218
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
already dealt with uh difficult

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,479
discussion issues so i'm i'm not

220
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,560
anticipating any particular difficulty

221
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
if we get to our uh so i'm beating the

222
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
bushes trying to get two more reviews

223
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,959
and after that we can send it off to the

224
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,599
rfc editor

225
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
great thank you

226
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,440
then the next one is six low use cases

227
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,399
draft

228
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,800
it has been evaluated by the security

229
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
area directorate and the general area

230
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,120
and it has been updated

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,640
as a result and there will be a

232
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,680
presentation later today on this draft

233
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,480
and uh well perhaps i don't know the

234
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
next step maybe but after that it will

235
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,680
be ready for telechat

236
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,640
um

237
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,920
anyway

238
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,279
yeah eric

239
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,399
yes i think

240
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,279
i

241
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,800
passed last call i just need to issue

242
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,480
the ballot and bring it to telechat

243
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
which i should be able to do by the end

244
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,320

245
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
great thank you

246
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,080
and finally the multicast address

247
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,640
listener registration document has been

248
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,600
updated several times since the last atf

249
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
uh thanks to michael richardson and

250

questions then we can proceed to the

258
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,920
next presentation on the use cases draft

259
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,320
okay nice to meet you uh my name is hong

260

282
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,279
uh

283
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,399
has he said he has some issue so i'll

284
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,680
talk about in more detail and document

285
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,680
from peterby uh he said already with the

286
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,959
issue so he is

287
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,839
his comment was uh mainly for the minor

288
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,839
issue okay let's space please

289
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
okay

290
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
i talked about the comment from robot

291
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,399
spark the first one is the security

292
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,760
consideration

293
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,959
originally

294
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,079
this document is the usual document so

295
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,200
if you see the section 7 security

296
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
construction

297
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
there is all

298
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,200
two sentences security construction are

299
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,399
not directly applicable to the document

300
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,720
for the use cases the security

301
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,880
requirement describes in the protocol

302
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,639
section of line

303
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,000
but he says that

304
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
the text of this draft has several plays

305
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,959
that rightly call out like the

306
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,600
implication of privacy privileges to

307
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,560
become a shared issue and assumption is

308
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,519
that l2 security must be present

309
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,399
so he recommends to add a word on

310
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,360
sentence for the security construction

311
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,079
so

312
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,519
uh if you see the the blue box i add the

313
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,959
newly added that is the six row stack

314
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,920
use the ipv6 address model and it is

315
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,800
required to consider the implication for

316
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,440
privacy with l2 address drive ipv6

317
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,800
addresses

318
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
in a typical six row use cases with the

319
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,519
operator of secure data

320
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,760
it is also required to provide secure

321
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,240
data transmission even though the

322
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,639
six-row stack do not address curate at

323
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,360
the network layer it is required to

324
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,600
provide l2 level security and the

325
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,519
application level security is highly

326
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,880
desirable

327
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,639
but after a submission of this division

328
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,240
of document

329
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,200
i got a response from robert spark but

330
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,120
he does not satisfy so i need to enhance

331
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
more in the next revision

332
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,920
okay next page please

333
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,839
yeah and another is also

334
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,839
security so if you thought uh table

335
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,639
two

336
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,440
or there are some the law for which is

337
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,920
regarding to security requirement for

338
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,440
because which

339
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,839
g-wave period security msdp and nfc and

340
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,519
plc but he suggests that

341
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,839
on content is not clear so i think that

342
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,240
it is better to remove the

343
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,160
role itself so in the update revision i

344
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,199
treated this part

345
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,760

yeah uh

347
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,079
the third comment from robert spark is

348
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:20,959
that

349
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,199
uh appendix a uh in

350
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,560
previous revision there is appendix a it

351
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,279
is the design space dimension for sixth

352
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,880
row deployment

353
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,639
on kuju next space please

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,880
yeah in appendix a on design speed

355
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,120
dimension for six rupee deployment there

356
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,680
are some descriptions of deployment

357
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,399
photo strapping topology l2 mesh

358
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,120
wireless remesh multilingual survey data

359
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,079
radar

360
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,880
blah blah blah so this is not directly

361
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,000
related to uh

362
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,120
sixth row while sixth row open

363
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,440
technology but it is helpful to

364
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,160
understand and help people to design

365
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
for the network so

366
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,240
yes uh could you back to

367
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,839
one page please

368
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,959
oh sorry

369
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,240
a back one

370
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,680
yeah

371
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,560
so

372
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,959
he says that appendix a is neither

373
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,440
introduced nor reference from the body

374
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,079
of the document yes it is true

375
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,360
so

376
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,320
you know in itf

377
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,440
106 meeting

378
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,759
they recommend that this document is a

379
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,639
little too long so it must be

380
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,920
short and

381
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,040
it narrow down and focus something

382
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,320
so reflect the command the

383
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,360
uh this section was originally

384
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,360
section 5.1 but it was moved to appendix

385
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,079
a

386
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,560
but now uh

387
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,800
the relationship from the

388
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,079
main body is not exist so

389
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,040
i would like to ask how to handle the

390
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,720
appendix say my personal opinion is to

391
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,320
remove this appendix a if it is not

392
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,759
important

393
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,120
okay next page please

394
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
okay next page

395
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,560
yeah

396
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,800
the final comment from robert spark is

397
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
that

398
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
this document has some misuse of canal

399
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,120
description and marketing words for

400
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,199
example superior range so he suggests to

401
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,320
change to better than or goes further so

402
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,079
i agree that

403
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,800
because this trap has some parts which

404
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,480
are recognized at the marketing world

405
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,800
because we invited some expert for

406
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,000
example

407
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,320
double

408
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,040
threat or electricity or white sun etc

409
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
so

410
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,320
there are some

411
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,799
use of the marketing world so i try to

412
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,720
change the marketing words to technology

413
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,839
words in this revision

414
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,119
okay next page please

415
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,839
this is the comment from p3 uh she says

416
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,240
that there are no the major issue and

417
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
there are some minor issues

418
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,319
two or three

419
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,240
items so i try to update to reflect all

420
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,600
minor issues in this revision

421
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,199
okay next page please

422
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,320
yeah that's sure thank you

423
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,360
okay so

424
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,240
one comment by the way as author of the

425
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,120
document regarding appendix

426
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
there is a paragraph

427
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,960
introduction which says that the

428
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,160
document covers design dimensions and so

429
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,200
on

430
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,559
so uh

431
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,880
removing the appendix maybe one approach

432
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,360
but another approach is to to add a

433
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
forward reference from the last

434
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,320
paragraph to this appendix a and also if

435
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,050
i'm not

436
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,240
[Music]

437
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,320
mistaken i think that there's a

438
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,280
comparison table where each row in the

439
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,919
table is based on the different design

440
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,760
space dimensions

441
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,480
so we can discuss maybe

442
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,200
or well later

443
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
how to proceed but another approach is

444
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,440
keeping the appendix and maybe adding

445
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
some forward reference but we can

446
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
discuss

447
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,120
okay thank you

448
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,240
yeah

449
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,520
um

450
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,160
i do agree with carlos i i do apologize

451
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,240
i didn't read the appendix but i don't

452
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,640
think that just removing it without just

453
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,280
for an editorial issue makes sense the

454
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,960
first question is

455
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,520
is there any information that is useful

456
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,000
if yes then the solution of cardless is

457
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,600
the best way forward in my opinion

458
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,440
i'll insert myself in the queue here and

459
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,000
say on the security considerations stuff

460
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,480
um there's

461
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,240
there's plenty of text that we can point

462
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,280
to from rfc 8200 security section

463
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,799
and 8200 has links to other

464
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,799
security documents for ipv6 neighbor

465
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,640
discovery security considerations so i

466
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,679
don't know

467
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,200
uh if that would satisfy robert's

468
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,799
concern but

469
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,400
we could certainly point to all the

470
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
other security sections and all the

471
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,280
other things it's basically

472
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
because i

473
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,840
there's nothing

474
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,679
there are no new conservative security

475
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,679
considerations per se right i mean all

476
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,240
the security considerations

477
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,320
are things that affect all the sub-ip

478
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,799
layers for all of ipv6 yeah so there's

479
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,559
we can just point to a bunch of existing

480
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,120
text i think

481
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,360
i'll uh i'll send some mail about uh

482
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,960
okay so

483
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,559
if there are no other comments on the

484
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,960
draft next we proceed

485
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,000
to the

486
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,080
multicast address listener registration

487
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,360
presentation by pascal

488
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,480
locales can you hear me okay

489
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,760
yes perfect

490
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,559
so

491
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,280
sorry not to be here with you guys

492
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,720
so yes we are we are uh now

493
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,360
deep into the the process of the

494
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
multicast registration document so this

495
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,640
document was stimulated by work which

496
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,720
happened effectively in

497
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,120
uh an alliance in three alliance called

498
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,360
white sand that was just mentioned

499
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,200
where they

500
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
use

501
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,720
six low and raw

502
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,520
uh

503
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,400
rfcs to be on the solution for mostly

504
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,000
for the smart grid over i2.15 for

505
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,880
so

506
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,240
um

507
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,400
the multicast registration came from

508
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,720
the realization that

509
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,520
they

510
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,640
still had to do a lot of multi of

511
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,520
link layer multi link multicast

512
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,559
uh to support mld even if we managed to

513
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,360
avoid it for nd

514
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,559
so

515
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,559
that was the question i mean how could

516
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,240
we do the equivalent of mld but

517
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,559
uh in a way that is

518
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,480
a pull from the device as opposed to to

519
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,640
from the router basically the the or

520
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
push call it the push from the device as

521
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,559
opposed to a pull from the router so the

522
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,240
device would not have to be listening to

523
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,760
paradigm ld

524
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,440
reports

525
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,159
so

526
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,640
next slide please

527
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
so we

528
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,919
we started with this

529
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,600
and we ended up uh also looking at the

530
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,520
way the multicast is distributed in

531
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,480
ripple

532
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,200
and since as you know most of the

533
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
iot cases of repo are using non-storing

534
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,000
mode we figured that

535
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,080
there was a need as well to enable the

536
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
multicast across the non-storing mode

537
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,679
network

538
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,559
and so we

539
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,400
we did that as well so the draft

540
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,320
actually ends up doing work for six law

541
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,360
but also work for raw

542
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,480
so in in this new uh update and since

543
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,919
well basically there were two or three

544
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,720
updates since atf 113

545
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,039
uh it was mostly clarification it's not

546
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,280
like well there is one thing i will show

547
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,919
you in the next slide but most of the

548
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,520
rest is clarification so we clarified

549
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,960
that uh effectively it's a push from the

550
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
device when the device wakes a support

551
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,919
as opposed to a pull from mld which

552
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,559
would require the device to stay awake

553
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,280
um a clarification that this tid you

554
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,440
know the sequence number that's that is

555
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,799
in the air option

556
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,840
and in ripple as well um is not used for

557
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,559
freshness assertions since

558
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,640
any cast and multicast come from

559
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,159
different sources that are not

560
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,760
necessarily synchronized for setting the

561
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,799
tid

562
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,880
so we clarified that the tid is not

563
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,480
checked and so the state actually

564
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,679
disappears

565
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,919
with a lifetime timeout so that's why

566
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,360
it's important that the lifetime is

567
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
chosen correctly

568
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,480
um

569
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,520
and

570
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,000
we the the big change is basically a

571
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,840
command i think it was from newcastle

572
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,080
i'm not too sure anymore but the

573
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,159
basically the question was

574
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,400
how you know if the writer reboots

575
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,000
how do we know that uh it needs to

576
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,039
to fetch

577
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,640
some state

578
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,039
and so we did two things

579
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,760
the first thing which really addresses

580
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,240
the low power devices

581
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,679
is a

582
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,600
multicast

583
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,760
arrow status that can be sent a

584
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,240
synchronous line and the name sh any

585
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,559
cast or multicast which will basically

586
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,520
say hey any state that i would have had

587
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,080
i could have lost and so please refresh

588
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,520
and since this is a pull by the router

589
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,360
again it's something that the low power

590
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
devices might miss

591
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,559
uh it actually shoots the the the lower

592
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,279
layer that

593
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,919
ysan for instance has because they

594
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,480
effectively has a multicast

595
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,159
periodic

596
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,480
window so they can use that

597
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,000
but for other iot devices or iot

598
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,679
networks where there is not such a

599
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,240
periodic multigas window

600
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,960
then it might be that this

601
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,159
n a is missed by the devices so we also

602
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,559
introduced something for the array which

603
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,720
is the node uptime option it's going to

604
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,440
be next slide

605
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,400
and

606
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,440
finally

607
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,360
i had some comments some only comments

608
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,080
by amanda barber uh about the ayada

609
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,360
section so

610
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,080
i cleaned you know the wording of the

611
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,600
irs section to to make it fit the way

612
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,400
i now wants it written so that's already

613
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
done that will save us time on the

614
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
publication process

615
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,360
now what is this new node uptime option

616
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,039
it is something that was needed in

617
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,960
rfc8505

618
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,600
that was not there because at the time

619
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
we we didn't really care

620
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,279
uh about

621
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,080
going to a network where

622
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,000
um

623
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,600
that there would not be enough

624
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,799
reliability on the routers basically

625
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,919
and so

626
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,000
uh now we figured that it was actually a

627
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,080
mess it was a command that we got a

628
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,400
number of times and so we kind of

629
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,159
leveraged this specification and the

630
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,080
particular discussion we had

631
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,159
uh on dna um with this new status to

632
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,760
effectively add the option in arrays

633
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,960
so it's it is um something that will

634
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,520
require um six-man uh visibility so now

635
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,440
i'm talking to eric since

636
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,679
i see you here

637
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,600
we are proposing a new option in the

638
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,640
array

639
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,720
to basically tell

640
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,039
well for the array to say how long this

641
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,799
router has been up

642
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,400
it's basically um

643
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
the sequence and a um a time

644
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,279
and so the the time i is split in two

645
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,039
fields one is an exponent and then there

646
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,240
is mantissa this allows to express very

647
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
short and very long times depending on

648
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,919
what the exponent is

649
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
with two bytes

650
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,760
so we we kept it short because you know

651
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,720
there are many things in arrays and uh

652
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,840
so that's why we compressed the

653
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
value this basically says in the

654
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,679
agnostic fashion you know this router

655
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,919
has been up for this time and so if you

656
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,320
registered if the node uses that to

657
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,400
register at the registered

658
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,840
um

659
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,200
or in

660
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
longer before basically the beginning of

661
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,159
the new life of this router

662
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,000
then the device can figure that the

663
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,720
router is not aware of the registration

664
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,960
status of this device and this device

665
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
should re-register

666
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,279
so this is basically another way for

667
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,799
advertising

668
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,080
uh that the the device is

669
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,760
uh has reboot

670
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,080
so the router has reboot then again the

671
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,880
array itself can be a multicast and then

672
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
again the device might not be listening

673
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,279
to it but it can also be stimulated by

674
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,080
by the device sending an rs if it fails

675
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,159
to connect or something or just

676
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,279
um sends an rs to the old routers is

677
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,600
still available and with this rs the the

678
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,840
router will reply with another type

679
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,399
option and the host will basically see

680
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,240
that the router has not been up for so

681
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,360
long

682
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,039
so this is this is the second way

683
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,880
basically that we propose

684
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,000
to uh enable the the host to discover

685
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
that the router has been down and has

686
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,279
lost registration state

687
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,320
next slide please

688
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,240
so that's basically it i mean

689
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,520
effectively the

690
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,480
document has been stable apart from this

691
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,799
addition this last time edition about

692
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,840
you know

693
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
awareness of the

694
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,200
of the router status and how long the

695
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,279
writer has been available

696
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,399
so

697
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,640
i understand that

698
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,480
you know that this is a cross area

699
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,159
discussion we have

700
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,480
uh some work uh

701
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,840
which interests

702
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,039
roles which which interests role someone

703
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,919
which which interests six law we decided

704
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,919
to package that together to have a

705
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,840
consistent story so people would see

706
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,480
exactly what's going on for multicast

707
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,440
and with this i will leave you know for

708
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,880
questions and then if um the chairs want

709
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,720
to say something about next steps

710
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,640
okay

711
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,279
so if if there are no questions

712
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,919
basically we discussed with the raw

713
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,120
chairs

714
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,919
and we informed our respective ads about

715
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,399
the plan so the plan would be that if

716
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,200
there is no significant issue raised

717
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,880
in this meeting

718
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,440
then we plan to launch a coordinated

719
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,679
working glass call which will happen in

720
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,720
both six low and role working groups

721
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,960
and well on the other hand

722
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,360
sixth law will remain as the home

723
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,960
working group

724
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,919
regarding shepherding making decisions

725
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,600
and so on but anyway the process will be

726
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,879
coordinated with growth

727
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,000
and then there is this new option right

728
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,679
at the

729
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,840
uptime for which we need to to

730
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,760
coordinate with six men i mean either

731
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,799
six-man

732
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,039
opposes in which case we can retract it

733
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,039
from the document

734
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,679
or if like a six man in which case we

735
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,200
can leave it

736
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,159
so basically there's always this risk

737
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,960
do you plan to present uh the draft in

738
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,360
six months this week

739
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,520
i would like to present the option at

740
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,440
six man at the the next uh

741
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,520
but but if it could be discussed on oh

742
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,200
ultimately yeah

743
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,120
tim since you reviewed the other

744
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,559
documents

745
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,320
for six men

746
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,000
because yeah

747
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,080
i think you could tim winners qa cafe i

748
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,360
think you could send it to six million

749
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,559
but i also was wondering about a

750
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,080
multicast group

751
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,679
should maybe look at this one because

752
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,679
it's got a lot of multicast

753
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,120
i don't think the whole organ group

754
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,080
needs to look at it but i think you

755
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,279
probably want to check in i'm guessing

756
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,760
pin is the last or m bone would be

757
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,520
either one of those would be popped into

758
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,880
my brain is just having them look at

759
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,760
this and

760
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,440
from a multicast perspective but yeah

761
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,559
six man

762
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,080
i don't think it's on the agenda but i

763
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,360
think you should run it by the working

764
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,120
group for sure because of the options

765
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,799
yeah that that's interesting we are

766
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,440
effectively the team we actually got

767
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
that

768
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,000
remark long ago at the beginning of this

769
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,960
document about multicast and as it goes

770
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,880
what you need to see is there is no

771
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
there is multicast in the original repo

772
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,039
using the preferred parent tree inside

773
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,840
the ripple but that's for storing mode

774
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,919
and here this is kind of specific we are

775
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,080
doing non-story

776
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,799
so what happens is the root of the

777
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,240
ripple

778
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,840
graph will basically do ingress

779
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,919
replication and tunnel

780
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,519
so there is

781
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,919
even though it's it's it's a multicast

782
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,159
registration

783
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,440
there is no

784
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,840
real multicast operation inside the

785
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
graph it's it's just ingress replication

786
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,320
of our uh tunnels to the edge routers

787
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,679
so so

788
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,440
yeah it's it's a

789
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,760
neutral for multicast

790
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,080
okay

791
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,960
so so eric what would be your suggestion

792
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,919
for the

793
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,679
the array option

794
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,600
how should we move forward with this one

795
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,039
i admit that i don't fully understand

796
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,960
what its intended use case is

797
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,279
uh anything that goes in the ra

798
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,120
you know

799
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,240
in normal nd semantics means it's

800
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,120
only

801
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,720
all the information in the ra must be

802
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,960
consumable by all multicast percent

803
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,360
volume by by all nodes recipients right

804
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,440
yeah and this is why it's very abstract

805
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,159
can you go down come on go back one

806
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,399
slide or two please

807
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,200
yeah this one so so it's the oath no

808
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,159
back yeah this one so the easy option it

809
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,559
the only thing it says really is is how

810
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,880
long this router has been up

811
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,240
because you know when the router goes

812
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,039
away it can send a final array but

813
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,159
and some people might miss it and and

814
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,159
the router reboots

815
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,760
and if

816
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,360
they have done whatever and it's

817
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,799
completely agnostic to what they have

818
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,559
done with this router

819
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,960
uh might maybe they will be interested

820
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
in knowing that the router has rebooted

821
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,360
and has been alive for this long but the

822
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,799
only thing that the option says

823
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,399
basically says the router has been up

824
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,159
for this long

825
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,440
and so it in our case uh we use it to

826
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,559
presume that the router has lost state

827
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,600
and that's valid for any kind of state

828
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,519
that the hope that the router could form

829
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,760
does this um

830
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,440
could this i mean that that sounds like

831
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,399
the thing that could have some

832
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,840
applicability to multiple

833
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,559
considerations uh can it be a a document

834
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,159
on its own just just about this option

835
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,679
yeah i

836
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,200
could do that too i guess if if that's

837
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,080
what the group prefers

838
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,039
now the only thing is

839
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,440
will this document be blocked or

840
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,279
is that why yeah i guess we can write it

841
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,720
such a way that it augments this one

842
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,640
without amending it right

843
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,880
so if if we take it separately

844
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,600
i'm willing to do that yes

845
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,480
then i would just take up the reference

846
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,919
to that document

847
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,840
publish again to that option publish

848
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,799
again

849
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,840
without it and then make it a separate

850
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,159
draft and a separate draft would say oh

851
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,560
it can be used for instance for for this

852
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,839
draft

853
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,639
is that the way you would

854
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,560
yeah i mean i i can see where this could

855
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,000
be useful

856
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,719
for

857
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,480
just for detecting reboots and possibly

858
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,440
for

859
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,239
some of the slack renumbering

860
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,520
concerns there were similar

861
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,800
i think nothing written but there were

862
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,560
some real similar

863
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,918
discussions about having some kind of a

864
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,639
generation number or a generation id uh

865
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,159
which is which is the ssi probably yeah

866
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,000
um

867
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,760
but uh i can't recall if there's any any

868
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,879
draft actually written about that but

869
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,040
um okay so your suggestion is take it on

870
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,719
a separate draft right make it a very

871
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,239
short simple draft for six men

872
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,560
yeah and the thing is you're gonna have

873
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,839
to decide

874
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,440
um how much you want to attempt fate in

875
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,040
that draft by listing various

876
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,800
conceivable use cases given that they

877
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,640
might all be picked apart by

878
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,560
people to say whether it is or is not

879
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,680
useful

880
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,920
uh it might be better to just say to

881
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,599
just to assert that it is

882
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,320
or it could be used

883
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,119
but yeah so i can basically take this

884
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,200
document we can progress this document

885
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,320
and and

886
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,720
use it as one reference that this thing

887
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,160
is useful

888
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,520
because you're gonna yes i think you're

889
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,599
also gonna need um yeah it's going to

890
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,200
have to have an accompanying operational

891
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,839
guidance section right that readers must

892
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,160
reset

893
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,359
uh i guess there is but i can take all

894
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,160
that text of this document i mean

895
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,640
it's it's more of a you know almost

896
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,160
last-minute edition

897
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,359
and

898
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,119
you know the requirement that i you know

899
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,160
we we make this rfc with a certain set

900
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,800
of requirements in mind and we for the

901
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,560
sort of requirements that we have in

902
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,800
mind there is effectively your multicast

903
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,720
channels and in most of the iot networks

904
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,400
i'm aware of they have a multicast

905
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,720
channel they don't want it's not fat

906
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,960
right you can't use it often but it

907
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,000
exists

908
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,640
and so we can use dna

909
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
with the new status

910
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,760
and that's enough for instance for y sub

911
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,119
um

912
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,040
so it's okay for me to remove that

913
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,119
option and put it in a separate document

914
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,599
we still have a consistent solution but

915
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,720
we only have dna we don't have the array

916
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,000
the array was

917
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,520
you know for the use case m and were off

918
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,400
it was nice to have

919
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,599
yeah i don't know i haven't um i don't

920
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,440
know how the document stands with this

921
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,400
piece uh removed um so

922
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
i wouldn't well it was it worked like

923
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that all the time it's it's a very

924
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,520
recent addition

925
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,560
so i i guess it would still i mean we

926
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
want this option it's more like

927
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,880
uh this was a way to avoid doing yet

928
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,560
another rfc

929
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,320
but if your recommendation is

930
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,880
effectively to do yet another rfc then

931
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,839
then

932
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,920
just to keep things separate

933
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,800
then we do it we kind of package the

934
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,760
full soyuz in one rfc in this case we

935
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,079
have six low we have raw and so we would

936
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,800
have had a little bit of six men as well

937
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,680
um but if that's not the proper way for

938
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,800
six men then we can take that off

939
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,680
make it separate

940
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,800
uh yeah let me you can uh

941
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,560
maybe we should talk to the six-man

942
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,000
chairs see what they think about a

943
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,359
separate document how that might be

944
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,400
received uh

945
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,000
whether that's useful if you're if

946
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,320
you're if you're up for it

947
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,400
i mean i'm open i mean the

948
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,119
the document can move without it

949
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,040
uh i needed a vector

950
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,599
to carry it so that was

951
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,800
one way

952
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,960
if you tell me there is a better way

953
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,320
i'll take the better way

954
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,240
uh i don't know exactly what th what a

955
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,760
better way might be just yet but yeah we

956
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,160
should we can talk about it offline yeah

957
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,320
yeah with eric and the six-man chairs

958
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,240
i'm completely open

959
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,440
so

960
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
yeah and i will update the document

961
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,280
based on that conclusion

962
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,720
and then we can launch the work group

963
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,040
let's go on buff

964
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,960
sites i guess we can do the one goodness

965
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,119
calls with the current document but if

966
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,920
the chess prefer uh i can

967
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,839
take it off

968
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,560
just let you know

969
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,520
yeah maybe

970
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,920
once every uh has a response from the

971
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,400
six-man chairs they're probably

972
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
maybe cleaner to

973
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,040
to launch the weather call uh with a

974
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,920
separate part uh i don't know if that's

975
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,480
whatever they conclude right so if if

976
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,400
they decide that they should remove that

977
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,320
section make it separate

978
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,000
then they'll do it and then we can

979
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,760
launch work up let's go if they say it's

980
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,200
okay let's just circulate it by six man

981
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,560
then we'll we'll do that as well so so

982
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,760
basically we will be holding

983
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,200
that's how i understand right we'll be

984
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,280
holding the word group let's go

985
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,760
till eric gives us the green light and

986
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,320
and the the action to be taken

987
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
have i understood that correctly uh

988
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,440
you're going to wait for me to send

989
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,320
email

990
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,560
and ccu and the chairs

991
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,240
to talk about

992
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,040
yeah

993
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,680
basically we we we we will be waiting

994
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,119
for recommendations by you eric wink

995
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,200
uh six many ladies and six-man shares

996
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,400
i'm sorry about making it separate or or

997
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,320
circulating it through six-man scs

998
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,760
yeah i can start that email thread and

999
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,480
then we can we can see where it goes

1000
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,320
nice

1001
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,040
but

1002
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,720
that's that's it on my side that's

1003
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,439
that's where we are

1004
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,440
thank you very much guys

1005
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,960
okay thank you thank you pascal

1006
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,760
so i guess

1007
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,680
yeah uh okay i'll try to make it fast

1008
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,119
so i'm going to present uh the update of

1009
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,880
the crafting title transmission

1010
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,520
compressed package over 15.4 networks my

1011
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,839
co-author is anna miraburo from mcleod

1012
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,400
next please

1013
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,920
so basically here there are some numbers

1014
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,359
this is about the motivation for the

1015
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,000
draft the idea is that with chic

1016
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,440
in some cases we are able to achieve

1017
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,000
greater heavy compression

1018
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,520
ratio than with traditional six low pan

1019
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,119
header compression

1020
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,440
especially if we consider also

1021
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,040
compression of application layer

1022
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,200
protocols like co-op

1023
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,680
so this expectation is this should lead

1024
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,440
to some significant performance

1025
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,800
improvement next please

1026
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,000
sorry

1027
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,560
oh we've lost the

1028
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
slides yeah i think shweta is offline at

1029
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,839
the moment so i don't know if eric

1030
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,640
is it possible

1031
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,119
uh yes i could try i don't know how to

1032
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,640
share from here

1033
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,440
i tried to make myself yes a delegate

1034
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,400
so but i have to be the first time i've

1035
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,240
ever tried to do that

1036
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
let's see here

1037
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,240
uh

1038
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,400
nope that just opens this up

1039
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,839
okay maybe i can open the materials

1040
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,560
i don't know how to share them

1041
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,799
okay maybe

1042
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,040
here we go okay

1043
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,520
this one

1044
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,520
share

1045
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,680
yeah so i'm seeing them on the screen

1046
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,480
now

1047
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,880
so if you can go to slide number three

1048
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,880
please

1049
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,839
no

1050
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:06,640
no

1051
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,040
no i guess it's you who is now

1052
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,880
can you control the those lights yes

1053
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,319
yes yes

1054
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,160
take me away to several

1055
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,200
okay

1056
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
thank you so basically i'm presenting

1057
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,040
revision03

1058
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,920
of the document which tries to enable

1059
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,200
the transmission of sheet compressed

1060
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,599
package over 15.4 networks

1061
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,160
next please

1062
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,680
so yeah on the updates in the draft

1063
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,960
you may recall that there was a problem

1064
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,560
with how

1065
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,440
we are

1066
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,839
going to compress ipv6 addresses and udp

1067
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,839
ports by using chic

1068
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,040
so

1069
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,400
sheik uses dev and up terms

1070
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,880
in its specification that corresponds to

1071
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,480
a constraint device on the left in the

1072
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,800
figure app corresponds to a

1073
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,400
network site infrastructure not

1074
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,920
constrained on the right

1075
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,400
and the shift specification this rfc

1076
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,839
8724

1077
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:10,800
um

1078
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,040
defines that compression of ipv6

1079
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,880
addresses and udp ports

1080
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,680
is performed uh

1081
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,880
expressing

1082
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,680
who is dead and who is up and not in

1083
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,160
terms of what is the source or the

1084
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,839
destination

1085
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,920
in of these fields

1086
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,040
so

1087
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,599
here the point is that because an entity

1088
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,359
knows in advance whether it corresponds

1089
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,560
to debian

1090
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,720
in chic then this allows some

1091
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,400
optimization because a single

1092
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,040
compression rule allows it to be usable

1093
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,200
in both directions as expressed in terms

1094
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,319
of level

1095
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,280
however

1096
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,839
well the point is that in some 15.4

1097
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,040
scenarios we can still use this

1098
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
optimization as is for example in star

1099
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,400
topology networks

1100
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,880
however if you go to slide number five

1101
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,359
next slide please

1102
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,440
there are some other scenarios in 15.4

1103
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,720
where

1104
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,520
we cannot just use the same approach as

1105
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,760
this because for example two peers

1106
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,520
within a mesh topology

1107
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,920
uh might be candidates to be considered

1108
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,400
depth so then who is that who is up

1109
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,800
so this is the problem the consensus so

1110
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,599
far has been trying to to stick to the

1111
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,599
developed terms because they are very

1112
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,599
much at the core of sheik and they still

1113
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,079
allow this optimization of using a

1114
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,599
single rule for compression in both

1115
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,040
directions

1116
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,359
and in version 0 3

1117
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,920
we now state that the chic compression

1118
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,520
decompression entity needs to know uh

1119
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,000
which is the role developed for each one

1120
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,880
of the rules that are going to be used

1121
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,200
in communication and actually this needs

1122
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,720
to be known in advance before

1123
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,400
communication happens

1124
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,520
and well knowing the role in advance

1125
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,040
makes sense because the rules also need

1126
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,960
to be written beforehand in advance

1127
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,800
before communication happens

1128
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,119
also now in zero three we reference the

1129
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,040
lp1 architecture draft

1130
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,160
um

1131
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,040
so this has some additions it will be

1132
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,480
discussed by the way the architecture

1133
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,599
draft

1134
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,480
in the lp1 working group later this

1135
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,160
this week and

1136
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
the idea is that it

1137
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,960
starts to provide a solution on this

1138
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,599
problem of who is that who is that

1139
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,000
in environments which are outside or

1140
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,280
beyond the original lp1 architecture

1141
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,839
next please

1142
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,599
so we've added a new section of title

1143
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,480
multi-hop communication where we explain

1144
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,520
that

1145
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,839
we can use routeover

1146
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,319
which means that routing is performed at

1147
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,640
the ip layer there is one

1148
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,480
straightforward approach that may be

1149
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,359
used to transmit compressed packets in

1150
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,800
this case

1151
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
which however requires all nodes to

1152
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,280
store all the rules in using the network

1153
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,240
so this presents some challenges in

1154
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
terms of scalability in terms of network

1155
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,040
size memory and so on so an alternative

1156
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,960
is that if ripple is used as the routing

1157
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,000
protocol then as suggested by pascal

1158
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,400
we can exploit ripple on story mode and

1159
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,520
use rfc 138 to make it efficient

1160
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,839
and in this case an endpoint must only

1161
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,440
store the rules for the communications

1162
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,040
it is involved in

1163
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,839
so

1164
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,319
this is some idea that we plan to

1165
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,160
develop and elaborate in subsequent

1166
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,480
versions of the draft and then we can

1167
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,240
also use mesh handler

1168
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,079
in this case there is no particular

1169
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,480
challenge uh to enable the transmission

1170
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,960
of g-compress packets here

1171
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,119
again in this case an endpoint just will

1172
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,640
not need to store the rules for the

1173
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,040
communications it is involved in and as

1174
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,160
a sort of optimization for reducing

1175
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,400
further the header

1176
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,960
we state that the rule id may be reused

1177
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,800
across disjoint pairs of endpoints

1178
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,440
however this means greater complexity so

1179
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,520
this is just some idea at the moment

1180
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,759
let's go

1181
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,920
yes sorry for the gory details but

1182
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,400
in uh non-stop we can use non-stirring

1183
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,440
mode uh in ripple even if the main diode

1184
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,359
is storing mode and we do that for uh

1185
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,359
low power devices which are not ripple

1186
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,680
aware and we can expect that a device

1187
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,280
that needs chic

1188
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,119
is probably not ripple aware it's

1189
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,960
probably one of those low power devices

1190
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,880
so it makes a lot of sense

1191
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,440
to to not contribute to not that

1192
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,880
straight to ripple

1193
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,000
use the ripple underwear leaf mode in

1194
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,160
which case it's always reported on story

1195
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,319
so when it's reborn on storing there is

1196
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,680
a tunnel

1197
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,880
between

1198
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,640
the first router and the um

1199
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,440
the the root so basically the root would

1200
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,960
have to know the rules for everybody

1201
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,520
and the leaf would just need their own

1202
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,200
set of rules

1203
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,520
so so it's not with every communication

1204
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,240
i mean the wording is not entirely crisp

1205
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,640
it's not the communication between twin

1206
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,079
points it's every end point

1207
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,000
communicating to the root the root will

1208
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,800
decapsulate the encapsulate may

1209
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,319
will decompress

1210
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,040
may recompress if the destination inside

1211
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,160
the dag or it will just send to

1212
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,400
to whatever up there but basically the

1213
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
compression would happen over the ripple

1214
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,440
network

1215
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,280
over the

1216
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,839
device to to root tunnel

1217
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,400
and yeah we

1218
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,960
we need basically the 6lr we would need

1219
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,400
to spend some time explaining exactly

1220
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,680
how it works but that's that's what

1221
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,200
would happen basically the session would

1222
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,240
be

1223
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,640
oriented you know the hub would be the

1224
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,040
roots there is enough discussion on lp1

1225
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,880
uh specification that when there is a

1226
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,440
habit spokes the hub is effectively the

1227
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,520
node that has rule for every spark

1228
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,079
and it is the it is up

1229
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,040
basically

1230
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,880
it is the upside

1231
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,720
so yes kind of lines

1232
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,119
yes

1233
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,160
maybe the same comment as possible if

1234
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,800
you use ripple then you have up and down

1235
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,559
so it's

1236
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,240
so it's very very close

1237
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,440
we use it who is it it is the app and

1238
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,880
the doubt it's completely consistent

1239
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,720
with the architecture it's just that the

1240
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,359
question was who has to have the rules

1241
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,599
and the route must have the rules to

1242
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,319
every uh ripple number nice

1243
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,599
right because there will be a tunnel

1244
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,880
between the reaper and the wall if and

1245
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,880
the rule the route

1246
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,040
um but the reaper and valiant just need

1247
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,119
its own set of fruit of rules and it

1248
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,880
doesn't need the set of rules of anybody

1249
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,359
else because the root will

1250
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,800
decompress and recompress if needed

1251
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,400
it's just the interaction between the

1252
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,680
the the loop ripper now if in the the

1253
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,200
first xlr

1254
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,440
if if we want to already send chic

1255
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,200
compressed packets there

1256
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,480
so

1257
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,480
or if we want the first xlr to do the

1258
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,160
compression on behalf of the reaper and

1259
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,839
the relief which is another possibility

1260
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,880
okay thank you so i guess we'll

1261
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,599
elaborate on the details and

1262
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,440
if we go quickly because we're running

1263
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,640
out of time to the next slide

1264
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,920
so

1265
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,559
yeah basically we are recommending

1266
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,359
that in the case of router

1267
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,920
virtual reassembly buffer should be used

1268
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,640
so i guess we should stop here due to

1269
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,319
the lack of time

1270
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,400
and we can continue discussing on the

1271
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,280
list

1272
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,359
and i guess that we can proceed with the

1273
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,319
next presentations on nsa by ouija

1274
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,480
hello so i

1275
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,480
in principle i can control the slides

1276
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,480
from my

1277
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,280
mobile phone

1278
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,119
i send the request

1279
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,559
the church i guess should

1280
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,520
allow me to do it

1281
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,440
wonderful

1282
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,839
here is the one

1283
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,800
okay

1284
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,880
so i have

1285
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,280
shrinked my presentation from 20 minutes

1286
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,599
to to 10 less than 10. the first

1287
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,000
presentation is a very quick update on

1288
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,040
the nsa the native short addressing

1289
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,640
um

1290
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,400
so

1291
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,920
we did an update in june fixing the the

1292
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,280
last uh

1293
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,839
concerns that were licensed okay um

1294
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,559
we did again as usual the the typos

1295
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,880
hunting um

1296
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,200
with the one main change is about

1297
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,359
reliability and i will come back to this

1298
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,640
in a couple of slides uh

1299
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,800
we added the clarification about the

1300
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,720
checksum calculation for the transport

1301
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,200
layer that was important and

1302
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,880
minor changes

1303
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,280
we need one new painting because we had

1304
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,000
an exchange with carlos which

1305
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,960
yes make sense to update a reference and

1306
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,440
clarify another point

1307
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,680
uh

1308
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,720
one thing that we did pascal actually

1309
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,280
raised the the issue about reliability

1310
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,800
very important thing

1311
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,200
and uh we actually discussed for a while

1312
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,760
how to approach this part and what we

1313
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,760
decided is actually to have a separate

1314
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,960
document because this reliability can be

1315
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,280
guaranteed in different ways

1316
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,440
and there is no one that is

1317
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
at the end really special specific about

1318
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,040
the nsa

1319
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,720
so we took out uh an old section that

1320
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,280
was called benefits of native short

1321
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,400
addressing

1322
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,280
which anyway was partially talking about

1323
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,960
the reliability

1324
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,800
and we added a small reliability

1325
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,559
consideration section

1326
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,800
where what we do basically

1327
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,599
we discuss our routing versus stateless

1328
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,280
for welding because at the end of the

1329
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,000
day what we do with nsa is

1330
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,319
is stateless forwarding we we structure

1331
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,160
the addressing space in such a way that

1332
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,000
we we have an idea where to send the

1333
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,680
packet

1334
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,520
a few words about the fact that the

1335
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,240
reliability is a multi-faceted problem

1336
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,040
and obviously we reference the

1337
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,040
the new document

1338
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,240
um

1339
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,040
so

1340
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,400
this is what

1341
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,400
the status on 113 so we had a few things

1342
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,680
to update

1343
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,000
okay to incorporate the this has been

1344
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,800
done

1345
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,559
um

1346
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,640
we said we're gonna issue

1347
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,200
revision three after one one three we

1348
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,280
did okay again we have these small uh

1349
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,119
things to be added but it's very minor

1350
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,760
note so we think really that the

1351
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,079
the document is pretty stable

1352
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,800
and uh unless there are

1353
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,359
main concerns that someone has

1354
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,640
we think we

1355
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,440
we can go uh forward for uh working

1356
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,040
group adoption i mean uh we we were

1357
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,160
kind of hinting on this on the 113 but

1358
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,920
we had some some

1359
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,800
work to do now is done and we we

1360
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,839
consider that is relatively stable the

1361
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,520
document

1362
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,559
and that's it for this one

1363
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,800
three

1364
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,359
minutes so unless there are questions i

1365
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:26,400
guess

1366
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,520
um

1367
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,839
this goes to the chairs about how do

1368
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,599
they want to proceed about the working

1369
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,920
group adoption call

1370
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,559
yes so uh perhaps it may be good to have

1371
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,760
at least the first sense of the room

1372
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,200
on

1373
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,240
adoption

1374
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,160
so i will use the show hands tool

1375
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,559
so

1376
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,799
in using the

1377
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,480
show of hands tool

1378
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,960
please raise your hand if you have read

1379
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,240
any version of the draft

1380
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,879
okay so

1381
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,520
at the moment at least nine people have

1382
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,440
read at least a version of the draft

1383
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,399
then

1384
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,280
so this is to get some sense of the room

1385
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,240
we are not

1386
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,119
making a decision at the moment

1387
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,480
okay

1388
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,400
and

1389
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,880
yeah so

1390
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,720
then the idea will be to to

1391
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,880
move to the mailing list

1392
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,359
uh we we're going to to discuss

1393
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,799
and um

1394
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,480
yeah

1395
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,599
issuing a working group um sorry i call

1396
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,599
for working group adoption

1397
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,440
will happen on on the mailing list

1398
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,119
so next okay

1399
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,520
if you want to use the last remaining

1400
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,200
minutes for the presentation on

1401
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,839
reliability

1402
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,119
uh

1403
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,839
i can go very quickly on the just to

1404
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,440
show the main approaches that we have

1405
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,760
there um yeah

1406
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,040
sure also also usually the room is

1407
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,359
closed five minutes past the official

1408
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,520
time so maybe let's use some additional

1409
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,240
extra time from there

1410
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,480
i will try to stay in the four minutes

1411
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,080
remaining

1412
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,319
[Laughter]

1413
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:37,180
it's a challenge

1414
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,050
[Laughter]

1415
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,599
[Music]

1416
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,319
but

1417
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,960
i still see this who has read any

1418
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,000
version of the draft on the screen

1419
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,160
um

1420
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,319
i think it is up to you carlos to take

1421
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,119
it out somehow

1422
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,839
yes now it should be out

1423
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,960
yeah i have permission already

1424
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,200
this is the right set of slides

1425
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,279
this is the chest

1426
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,200
okay okay so this is now new draft that

1427
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,240
we

1428
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,760
um

1429
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,319
we build in order to

1430
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,040
to tackle this issue about reliability

1431
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,559
this is very important so the main

1432
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,960
the main point is that there are several

1433
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,760
solution uh classes of solution that we

1434
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,440
can use uh

1435
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,079
the most important one let me go is the

1436
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,640
fact that obviously we need uh

1437
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,960
some prerequisites so the fact that

1438
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,200
actually we have redundant links now the

1439
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,839
question then is you can build multiple

1440
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,200
topology

1441
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,799
using multiple addresses or you you

1442
00:57:58,799 --> 00:57:59,680
just

1443
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,720
decide

1444
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,440
which link do you use you use one single

1445
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,400
address

1446
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,640
address for each node and you try to

1447
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,240
remember which link is active which one

1448
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,520
is not

1449
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,119
used okay

1450
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,960
so

1451
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,760
basically in the multiple addresses uh

1452
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,839
solution what you do is

1453
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,319
you build several topologies which means

1454
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,640
basically if you remember nsa is based

1455
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,400
on a tree uh

1456
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,040
topology so you have a second route and

1457
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,799
you uh add a secondary address

1458
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:33,760
uh

1459
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,839
for the nodes so by doing so you have

1460
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,640
two completely orthogonal topologies and

1461
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,240
you one you use it as a primary topology

1462
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,079
and then you have to decide when to

1463
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,839
switch to the second one when there is a

1464
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,680
failure now here there is such an

1465
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,240
example where that cross obviously is a

1466
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,680
failure what happens is a node can can

1467
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,319
uh send through an the secondary

1468
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,559
topology an icmp message to the main

1469
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,280
route to say look this branch of the

1470
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,240
tree

1471
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,799
subtree is not reachable anymore because

1472
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,760
i i see a failure okay and

1473
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,880
this way the root can can store this

1474
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,200
this information and redirected the

1475
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,559
traffic when needed same thing when we

1476
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,400
have a link that is broken you have to

1477
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,559
do the same thing from both sides so

1478
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,559
that you redirect in the right

1479
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,000
in the right way okay so that you still

1480
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,319
have a rich ability all the time

1481
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,359
pascal you have a question already

1482
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,520
yes if if uh for instance you have the

1483
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,640
breakage that you show here but it's the

1484
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,240
1000

1485
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,000
the guy in the bottom left it's not

1486
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,440
aware of that breakage is it

1487
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,799
[Music]

1488
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,520
1000 yes it's not a word what happens if

1489
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,240
if

1490
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,680
he sends traffic upward is 100 that

1491
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,880
redirects the traffic doesn't need to be

1492
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,760
the there is just one thing

1493
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,920
is meaningful what you said is

1494
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,920
you can consider optional to send i say

1495
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,240
an icmp downwards and you say you may

1496
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,280
consider to use your secondary address

1497
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,839
in order to bypass or all of this okay

1498
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:24,160
you have no choice because 100 will not

1499
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,559
get the traffic i mean you would have

1500
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,799
one would have to figure out that along

1501
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,920
the path

1502
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,920
there is a breakage and then it needs to

1503
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,079
take the bypass and instead of

1504
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,599
my bottom line is you're starting to

1505
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,680
doing to do a routing protocol as soon

1506
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,680
as you start doing this your

1507
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,040
your

1508
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,880
you put your your hands on europe and

1509
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,960
the pandora box after writing protocol

1510
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,520
sorry for me your voice was not clear

1511
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,079
can you repeat the point oh i'm sorry

1512
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,520
again

1513
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,520
doing all those things you're opening

1514
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,400
the pandora box of a routing protocol so

1515
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,400
the whole deal was

1516
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,680
you're

1517
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,760
you you don't need a routing protocol

1518
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,640
and now you're starting to do one

1519
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,720
so this is things we discussed a little

1520
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,640
bit in the draft but we need to clarify

1521
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,880
more the point is

1522
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,119
if you have few

1523
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,720
few failures you have a few

1524
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,559
very small state

1525
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,319
and few redirections

1526
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,960
and everything works fine

1527
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,680
uh but as long as you have something

1528
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,400
that's more unstable more failures more

1529
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,839
dynamicity

1530
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,079
this goes back to routing

1531
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,040
indeed

1532
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,960
and in a certain way

1533
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,799
so the other solution

1534
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:42,000
goes along what you are saying because

1535
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,680
we use still um redundant links but we

1536
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,319
use just one single addressing space so

1537
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,799
so we we every node has one single

1538
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,599
address but he has to store

1539
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,480
alternate um

1540
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,000
neighbors like an alternate patent a

1541
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,960
parent

1542
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,119
different childs and so to make a

1543
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,480
decision

1544
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,079
when there is a a failure

1545
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:12,640
let me go maybe to the final slide

1546
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,880
here the point is

1547
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,640
with what we discussed in this document

1548
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,359
is if you use multiple addresses the the

1549
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,359
the in the root you have

1550
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,200
very low state because this really

1551
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,200
depends how how many failures do you

1552
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:27,920
have

1553
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,400
okay and also the the state that you put

1554
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,839
into the nodes is pretty low

1555
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:34,400
uh

1556
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,280
but because everything is done locally

1557
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,559
in a certain way and there is no

1558
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,799
coordination at all the more failures

1559
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,799
you you have

1560
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,440
i mean the more messy you you you end up

1561
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,480
and there is less guarantee that

1562
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,039
there is a feasible path okay when the

1563
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:54,480
single address solution okay in the root

1564
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,920
in a certain way it has to have a a good

1565
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,680
knowledge of the topology hold the

1566
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,200
topology so the the state is higher okay

1567
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,440
uh on the single node

1568
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,559
we we still have low state because it's

1569
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,599
basically neighborhood okay

1570
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,839
and but the robustness is higher just

1571
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,640
because you you concentrate the uh

1572
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,559
knowledge in the roots so

1573
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,839
there is more coordination and more

1574
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:25,680
failures that you can keep up with so

1575
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,280
but

1576
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,599
your rider is there are trade-offs and

1577
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,319
then at some point if you consider that

1578
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,640
your network is not as stable and

1579
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,559
reliable as you think

1580
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,039
certainly

1581
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,319
you have to think whether or not to put

1582
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,000
routing

1583
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,119
okay

1584
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,599
adnan

1585
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,960
hello adnan we cannot hear you

1586
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,680
yes uh can you hear me now

1587
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,200
no yes

1588
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,039
yes luigi uh have you tested the failure

1589
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:08,720
scenarios of the

1590
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,839
multi with multiple classes

1591
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:14,720
mean if you are saying is not reliable

1592
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,079
so alan is not reliable actually

1593
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,319
their nature is actually like this

1594
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,319
so

1595
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,200
so i think uh uh can you tell me the

1596
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,960
failure scenarios

1597
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,000
you guys have tested

1598
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,240
okay

1599
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,240
with sorry to interrupt

1600
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,240
um i guess in

1601
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,760
some seconds we are going to get the

1602
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,960
room closed not

1603
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:53,359
[Music]

1604
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,799
and available

1605
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:55,599
so

1606
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,359
let's hope that

1607
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,760
we can see each other in london

1608
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,280
and

1609
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,440
yeah perhaps we should also ask for a

1610
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,280
longer session

1611
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:10,640
okay so have a nice itf week thank you

1612
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,160
thank you everyone

1613
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,038
wait a minute

1614
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,720
um
