25
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,880
at the beginning of the week which is uh

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
unusual because we usually have it in

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
the middle or towards the end

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,040
um so it gives us a chance to when we

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,920
get to open mic to talk about any

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
you know cross-working group things that

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
you might want to highlight or things

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,040
that you want to tell other people about

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,719
for the rest of the week that's going to

34
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,640
be a good thing

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,719
so let's start with the slides next

36
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,719

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,840
part of the policy

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,560

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400

please remind your working groups about

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,720

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,400
cases reported

51
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
and we of course don't want that to

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
spread to anyone else

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,840

55
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
be aware of what it talks about not just

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,400
about

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,440
intellectual property but also about

58
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
conduct

59
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,360

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,879
items listed there

61
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,599

for example be nice to other people is

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,599

66
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,200

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,080
just to remind everyone to do this not

79
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
just of course in person or at the

80
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,120
meetings

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,040
but also as you communicate through the

82
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,799
instant messaging as well

83
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,959

84
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,120

tied to a new tool called solip

88
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,879
so jabber if you still happen to have a

89
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,760
jabber account has a bridge to that but

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,959

please review documents

137
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,240
this is important because a big part of

138
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
the mission of the atf is to produce

139
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199
documents that people can

140
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
use to interoperate these documents need

141
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,840
to be

142
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
clear they need to be readable by

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,680
everyone not just by the person who

144
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
actually wrote them

145
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
it is great

146
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
that in many cases you trust all your

147
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
fellow itf participants and trust that

148
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,840
their documents

149
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,360
are clear

150
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
it would be better if you actually

151
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
reviewed the documents

152
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,720
and we all made sure that they are the

153
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,319
way this should be

154
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,400
so please review them as part of the

155
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,759

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,919
a buff at the last ietf

175
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,960
and then we're gonna have some time at

176
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,800
the end for uh

177
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
open discussion

178
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,280
does anyone

179
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,720
want to add anything to the agenda or

180
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
change anything

181
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
i hope all of you looking down are

182
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,680
looking at the agenda on the miraco

183
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,759
very carefully all four items

184
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,080
just one thing to add i think uh i want

185
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
to repeat about the

186
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
mask reminder because i think a few

187
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
people came in late and maybe

188
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,960
didn't hear alvaro reminding you that

189
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,520
we're all expected to wear masks unless

190
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,039
we are actively speaking at the

191
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,759
microphone or eating or drinking so

192
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,479
thank you very much

193
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,879
okay

194
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,960
who's gonna talk to this

195
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,879
i guess i'm holding the mic so i can

196
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,120
talk to this one um

197
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
uh

198
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,639
right so

199
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,479
not too many changes in our working

200
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
groups in our area

201
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,520
we have savnet as our new working group

202
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,319
though

203
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,039
and we have uh msr6 when is msr6 meeting

204
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,000
tomorrow

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,399
six tomorrow okay

206
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
and sadness today there we go and

207
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,479
i'll hand that to you yeah and welcome

208
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,399
to ijune as um

209
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
new sabnet chair

210
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,080
yeah and then just one other note on the

211
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,240
working group status changes

212
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,040
um

213
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
sfc

214
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,519
is going to be closed fairly imminently

215
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,360
we've got agreement with the chairs

216
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,720
there

217
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
and i've also had some discussion about

218
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,360
one of the other working groups i think

219
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,760
the next itf you'll see some movement

220
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,279
there

221
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,040
the philosophy is basically if there's

222
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
no more active documents in the working

223
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,480
group

224
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
then rather make sure that we've got the

225
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
space and time to

226
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,040
do more work elsewhere and hence closing

227
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,440
those groups so yeah that's a little bit

228
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,600
from there

229
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
uh sure so this slide is just uh the

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
distribution of the working groups

231
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
between the three of us in case you

232
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
don't know who the corresponding idea is

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
just come in and look for us

234
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,839
uh but yeah you can talk to any of us

235
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,600
about any anything especially if there

236
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,839
are issues in the working groups

237
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,279
um

238
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,240
next slide so now we're on to the uh

239
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
running directorate report

240
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,320
um

241
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,760
haumean i believe should be online

242
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,690
yes

243
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,240

joining uh so late

246
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,519
we're bringing up the

247
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,600
just the testing to see if people hear

248
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
me

249
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,440
yes we can hear you uh go ahead

250
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,360
okay this would be a very quick summary

251
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
on the writing every directorate

252
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,720
next page please

253
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,200
yeah currently we have actually 43

254
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
experts in the teams and the last time

255
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
we did some rotated uh under the

256
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
kind of ids

257
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,720
now we are having 43 of them and

258
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
we don't have a member changed

259
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,720
from last ietf the purpose of this team

260
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,880
is to give the

261
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,760
review of the routing

262
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
and other

263
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,560
related drops from other areas

264
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,800
and we also offer the

265
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,440
early review of any routing area

266
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
document before the last cross so all

267
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,399
the

268
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,360
working group chairs are welcome to

269
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
request this kind of review to the

270
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,279
doctorate

271
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,600
and the wiki page is available and

272
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,640
you're welcome to visit that

273
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,959
next week please

274
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,519
and here are some very brief statistics

275
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,480
uh

276
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,360
from

277
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,279
last itf actually we just trimmed this

278
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,320
to

279
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
restart the

280
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,880
data from 2021

281
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,160
and uh from 2021 we are totally having

282
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,360
21 early review and 53 last call reviews

283
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,399
and

284
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,120
since last itf there are five early

285
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,360
review and the 14 last call review so

286
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,200
basically this is

287
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,880
a

288
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
very close to the average number uh

289
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,040
given the past few meetings and the top

290
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
working groups are idr

291
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,839
best and the rsr we also

292
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,240
give quite many review on the other

293
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,519
areas say

294
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,959
basically on all psa and

295
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,079
side drops if i remember correctly

296
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,560
and the next

297
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,440
uh this will be the final page and all

298
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,720
the uh the potential result of the

299
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,680
review would be ready with needs with

300
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,639
issues and not ready so basically this

301
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,959
is how the uh

302
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,800
number of distributions for different

303
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,320
kind of reviews

304
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,079
and we have been looking at okay the

305
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,760
for for the draft

306
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,720
from rotting area this would be

307
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
almost a half

308
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,600
50 percent of them getting ready and

309
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,079
there there are a lot of the

310
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,320
works need to be follow up

311
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,079
after the review as well

312
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,800
and basically another uh

313
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,360
statistic for the non-routing

314
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
draft is on the right-hand side for

315
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
people's information

316
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
and i think that's it and we will keep

317
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,320
this updated every

318
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
time

319
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,760
and report it to the routing area thank

320
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,839
you

321
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,880
thank you helmion any questions about

322
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,839

so thank you to everyone who's a member

324

328
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,639
chance

329
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,120
so um

330
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,320
moving on to the next piece of the

331
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,040
agenda um

332
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,800
we have a routing

333
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,199
we have a mailing list called uh routing

334
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,399
discussion

335
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,920
uh this list has been around forever

336
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,480
it's a you know general itf list

337
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,920
uh it's it is a non-working group list

338
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,839
the purpose of this list has been

339
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,160
to have general discussions around

340
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,680
topics related to the routing area

341
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
so we have

342
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,639
updated the description of this list

343
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,800
and we wanted to talk a little bit about

344
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,120
about that with you um

345
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,720
just so that you're aware you can now

346
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,680
visit um in the next slide there's a

347
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
link to the

348
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,160
[Music]

349
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,320
mailman list information you can visit

350
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,480
that and see the whole description

351
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,720
of everything that we put there

352
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
basically

353
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,800
the purpose of the list doesn't change

354
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
uh we're just making the description a

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
little bit more more

356
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,320
complete to

357
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,560
[Music]

358
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
include a little bit of scoping calling

359
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,000
out things that are okay to be posted

360
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,800
there

361
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,560
uh we never really had you know issues

362
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,680
with with inappropriate postings um and

363
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,360
also uh we are talking about a little

364
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,880
bit more specific about the the

365
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,639
moderator

366
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
role what a moderator is we're assigning

367
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,399
a moderator to the list

368
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,000
ross white

369
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
who's sitting over there

370
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,399
he's waving

371
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,240
he volunteered to be a moderator of the

372
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,600
list

373
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,199
and one of the things that we're doing

374
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,519
is we're extending

375
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,720
the moderator's responsibilities

376
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,800
to track specific topics

377
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,440
and to later report

378
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,959
one of the reasons that we're doing this

379
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,199
is because there have been topics that

380
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,639
have come up in different places in the

381
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,639
rowing area or even outside the routing

382
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,000
area in some cases

383
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,120
that

384
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,560
are maybe not ready enough

385
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,079
be

386
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:24,880
a

387
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,199
a working group or a boss or have a

388
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
specific proposal those things should

389
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,040
already

390
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
follow the normal process maybe go to

391
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,959
our twg for example

392
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,519
but they are important to discuss

393
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,079
last time in our twg example there was a

394
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,079
presentation around the importance of

395
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
thinking about the evolution of routing

396
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,920
in the internet

397
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,759
yes that's an important topic it is

398
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,360
within

399
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,920
the purview of the routing area our

400
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,600
mission remember is to keep the routing

401
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,079
system uh operational

402
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,920
and to

403
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,279
make sure that the internet works pretty

404
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,240
much

405
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,079
uh so you know topics like that are

406
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,759
within the purview

407
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,079
but they are not specific enough right

408
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,240
to be considered

409
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,000
to be a working group to just go discuss

410
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,199
routing

411
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,199
the future of routing but we want to

412
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,800
track those discussions so we already

413
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,399
have this list

414
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,639
so the basic addition

415
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
is that extra

416
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,519
function of the moderators

417
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,079
uh if you go look at the description it

418
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,720
has some pointers to

419
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
the note well

420
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,959
and the anti-harassment policies

421
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,560
and the code of conduct and you know

422
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
things like that that you expect

423
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,839
that were not there before but you know

424
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,279
just for completeness

425
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,600
uh we did add these two

426
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,079
uh lists of things that we believe are

427
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,519
appropriate

428
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,720
and things that we believe are

429
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,000
unappropriate

430
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
of course appropriate is general topics

431
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,560
that are related to the routing area

432
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
that doesn't include

433
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,480
things that are related to the routing

434
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
area but have

435
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,279
homes

436
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,640
so if you want to talk about

437
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
extensions to ospf

438
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
you have an idea around ospi well there

439
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,559
is a working group for that so we should

440
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,720
go to that working group to discuss

441
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,280
those things

442
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,959
we also include here well the first

443
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,400
bullet there is initial discussions of

444
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,439
open-ended uh topics so

445
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,119
evolution of routing for example is an

446
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,359
open in the topic that we hope that by

447
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,360
discussing it we will come up with more

448
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,039
specific proposals

449
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,760
that as a community we can discuss uh

450
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
things and agree on maybe a direction

451
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,799
that i don't know what what the

452
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,880
discussion is going to be about

453
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
um

454
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,720
maybe

455
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,640
announcements of conferences or events

456
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
that are related to the routing area

457
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,880
that's fine and discussions of idea of

458
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,280
routing area specific

459
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
policy or direction

460
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,760
those things are all in scope

461
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,280
things that are not in scope that you

462
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
can see there are of course

463
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,039
uh advertisements or you're trying to

464
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,799
hire someone or you know whatever those

465
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,360
types of uh emails are not

466
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,559
not good

467
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,120
um anything that goes against the code

468
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,239
of conduct or

469
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,280
or is at odds with whatever the note

470
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
well talks about

471
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,760
uh discussions of subjects that are

472
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,520
unrelated to the routing area of course

473
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,960
we don't want to discuss them there

474
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,720
there's probably other working group

475
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,160
other lists

476
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,600
uh maybe working groups maybe other

477
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,919
non-working lists go

478
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,760
um

479
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
discuss them in uh announcements about

480
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,039
conferences that are not related to the

481
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,160
routing area

482
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,760
so you know there's a wide

483
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,840
range of things you can post and discuss

484
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,480
on the list

485
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,280
we're just making it a little bit

486
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
clearer

487
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
and

488
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,919
the

489
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,360
text about the moderator

490
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,960
there's two parts of that text one is

491
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
what you would expect you know a

492
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
moderator batteries list you know there

493
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,120
are

494
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,640
tools

495
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,039
that a moderator can use if there is

496
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,160
uncivil

497
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,480
behavior for example to

498
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,080
um

499
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,840
to restrict postings etc you know the

500
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,360
same things that

501
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,039
work group chairs have for their own

502
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,120
lists the same mechanisms are used in

503
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,559
other itf lists

504
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,880
and then we added this paragraph that

505
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,960
says when directed by the routing ids

506
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,120
the moderator may monitor specific

507
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,480
topics

508
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,919
and then report back to the routing area

509
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,679
hopefully in a meeting like this in the

510
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,360
routing area open meeting

511
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,480
there may be

512
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,200
a

513
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,360
discussion and request for maybe time

514
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,799
enter a meeting maybe you know some

515
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,240
other time to go discuss some of the

516
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,000
topics that are being discussed

517
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,440
uh on the list

518
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,559
uh this is again intended to catch

519
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,720
important discussions around writing

520
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,880
technology around the routing area

521
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,640
that

522
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,880
currently don't have a specific home

523
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
that are

524
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,200
maybe broad

525
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,559
general

526
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,360
that

527
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,280
are important to the area and that are

528
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,799
important for us to

529
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,840
as a community consider

530
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,360
so

531
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,400
any

532
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,919
questions

533
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,000
doubts concerns

534
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,880
around this

535
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,559
uh update to the description of the

536
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,360
routing discussion list

537
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,880
we hope we haven't paired

538
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,520
a membership of the lists

539
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
it would be great

540
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,400
if

541
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,840
you all went and subscribed to the

542
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,520
rather discussion list

543
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
as uh yeah we hope again that it's going

544
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,919
to be more

545
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,159
of a general discussion

546
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,280
forum

547
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,960
for routing specific

548
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,440
topics and since all of you are sitting

549
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,679
here i'm assuming all of you are routing

550
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,679
specific topics it's going to be a great

551
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,799
list for you to be part of

552
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,320
i haven't seen a big volume of

553
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,080
messages on the list so you don't have

554
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
to you know

555
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,600
be thinking about an extra volume of

556
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,320
things to go read

557
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,880
comments questions everyone happy

558
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,360
can we do a wave

559
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,640
no

560
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,679
yeah there you go

561
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,120
yeah okay great

562
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,760
all right

563
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
yes

564
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,240
all right so just to

565
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,280
briefly tee this up

566
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,159
just to briefly tee this up um

567
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,080
you may remember that at the

568
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,200
at 113 we had a computing aware

569
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
networking buff

570
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,679
and

571
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,480
we

572
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120
there's been sort of a lot of action on

573
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,799
the list since then

574
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,480
um

575
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,159
so

576
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,120
there's a short readout prepared for

577
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,520
today

578
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,400
and

579
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,520
are you

580
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,840
ready to speak actually i don't know

581
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,240
is yeah peng please go ahead and unmute

582
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,799
yourself and um

583
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,000
andrew are you going to advance the

584
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,559
slides or us okay

585
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,360
okay

586
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,520
go ahead

587
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,840
yes we can hear you

588
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,320
uh this is paulie from child mobile and

589
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,720
it's my pleasure to introduce work of

590
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,120
computing aware networking and we had

591
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,679
above in idea 1 3 and there are some

592
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,840
progress of both

593
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,639
nexan space

594
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,000
the first is the recap of the

595
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,720
motivations company aware networking in

596
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,039
that computing and network resource

597
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,440
optimization by steering traffic

598
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,919
to appropriate computing results

599
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,320
considering both network and company

600
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,640
status

601
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,960
so it is to solve the problem of the

602
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
closest is not the best based on the

603
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,320
increasing development of cydia and

604
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,679
edge computing providing the best

605
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,200
user experience

606
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,400
okay next slide please

607
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,880
so in the camp of the use cases showed

608
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,280
the necessity of steering traffic

609
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,080
considering more factors besides network

610
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,120
letters

611
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,840
we also analyzed the gap with dynasty

612
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,640
and the load balancer which has a gap of

613
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,159
design for

614
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,880
dynamic scenarios of bus approach with

615
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,720
additional latency and

616
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,440
should learn more resource status

617
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,760
and there were two potential solutions

618
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,480
including the dynamic anycast and

619
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,279
enhanced load balancer

620
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,919
the conclusion is that both the buff was

621
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,159
successful in agreeing that the use case

622
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,679
are important while the solutions and

623
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,679
is not clear

624
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,640
the next size of it

625
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,120
so to promote this work based on the

626
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,360
above discussion we collect

627
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,440
36

628
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,760
issues in the both discussion gave

629
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,240
responses and updated the drafts

630
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,279
accordingly i select some of them

631
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,240
that might be concerned by the community

632
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
the first category is what the relation

633
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
between can traffic steering and

634
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
service deployment

635
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,200
discovery and the upper layer protocol

636
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,960
the object is that

637
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,200
can you assume the service has been

638
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,080
deployed and discovered in multi-edge

639
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,440
sites aiming at traffic steering can be

640
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,320
coordinated with upper layer for service

641
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,679
deployment and discovery moreover the

642
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,480
commuting metrics collection income will

643
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,360
also benefit them and the second

644
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,480
category is what's the relation between

645
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
can auto

646
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,640
auto solve the problem of service

647
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,159
instance selection as an office solution

648
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,960
as dinners and the road bands

649
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,679
replies for applications or service

650
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,919
before traffic delivery might not be

651
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,200
optimal or

652
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,640
valid after the handover so more details

653
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,880
are needed of also including some

654
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,640
extension to support

655
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,400
multi-deployment quick interaction

656
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
integrate more

657
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,400
performance metric information

658
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,279
this discussion has also been copied to

659
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,960
auto wg

660
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,559
and

661
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,240
the third category is about the

662
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,799
competing resource the measurement of it

663
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,240
has similarity and the difference with

664
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,279
network

665
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,360
the usage of convenience stores are

666
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,960
often more service specific the category

667
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,720
based method are expected but would be

668
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,240
solution related and we also submitted a

669
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,760
new draft for that and there also was a

670
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,080
paper about it and the first one is that

671
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,559
um can won't impact every router

672
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,120
so here's a on-pass selection method

673
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,159
might be a potential choice and the last

674
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,600
one is about compute path

675
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,960
can doesn't compute fast directly it is

676
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,080
aware of the network path status and

677
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,880
coordinates with existing

678
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,080
routing

679
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,480
or path solutions

680
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,720
those are create issues concerned by the

681
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
community and more issues could be

682
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,120
formed as a github

683
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,000
next slide please

684
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,880
and we have updated the three key draft

685
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,679
of problem statement use cases

686
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,640
gap analysis requirement and diecast

687
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,279
architecture and also submitted new jobs

688
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,600
about convenience source modelling to

689
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,159
describe the possible modelling of the

690
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,880
compute resource and the usage income

691
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,440
and as discussion after submitting this

692
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,159
draft the instance selection mechanism

693
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,919
might be another

694
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,799
item based on the modeling which will

695
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,919
which we will continue working

696
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,039
okay next slide space

697
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,600
so um for the next start steps uh based

698
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,279
on the discussion and the contribution

699
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,279
after above we won't can to focus on

700
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,200
routing related work

701
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
and here are also other issues we want

702
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,240
to get feedback from the community for

703
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,720
instance whether we should rename the

704
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,919
drop to

705
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,279
the cam prefix

706
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,279
at the same time maybe a kang million

707
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,559
list is better since we use die custom

708
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,159
in text now

709
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,840
and we will continue to refine the

710
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,320
drafts and work on more comments

711
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,159
if available we'd like to request

712
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,360
another

713
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,399
wg firm involved maybe in uh next

714
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,600
meeting

715
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,840
moreover we will make a prog

716
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,840
presentation in the tsvw of this itf

717
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,880
meeting for cross-domain communication

718
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,279
and that's all thanks and any comments

719
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,600
so while people are

720
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,960
running toward the microphone to make

721
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,000
comments

722
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,559
um i'll just say that

723
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,840
if you do want to engage on this um

724
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,919
the place to do it for the moment is

725
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,399
still the dimecast mailing list

726
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,279
and um if you do have any remarks about

727
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,559
you know what

728
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,320
where this work should go

729
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,679
um

730
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,840
if it should go etc you should

731
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,760
either share that on the dyncast mailing

732
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,679
list or you can

733
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,200
approach your favorite a b with your

734
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,640
comments

735
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,120
so we'll be around all week uh there's a

736
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,399
mic over there

737
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,320
or we we'd be glad to take comments in

738
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,200
private um

739
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,640
so

740
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,919
yeah

741
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,960
thank you thank you

742
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,320
and i think it's open mic now right

743
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,640
right so now we got to the part of the

744
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,120
meeting where you can all stand up and

745
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,640
run to the mic

746
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,600
um

747
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
please

748
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,440
before i see tony on the

749
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,880
with his hand up

750
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,880
tony do you have a question about can or

751
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,200
do you have something for the open mic

752
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,360
i had a comment if that you want that

753
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,360
now

754
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,840
sure go ahead

755
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,080
so it seemed to me from the can buff

756
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,159
that basically we

757
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,919
mostly came to the decision that this

758
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,000
was a load balancing problem

759
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,840
and not a routing problem

760
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,080
yeah we had uh load balance for the

761
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,279
potential

762
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,200
surgeon but maybe there's no condensers

763
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,799
that it is a balancer problem and

764
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,640
considering the

765
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,919
following work after the both uh

766
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,279
proponents

767
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,679
discuss more about the routing related

768
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,679
work

769
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,559
chris

770
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,880
i yeah i don't i tried to get in the

771
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,080
queue i don't know it didn't work but um

772
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,279
yeah i

773
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,880
i mean i just

774
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,760
to echo what tony just said i

775
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,679
just because you can or this isn't

776
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,360
echoing tony but just because you can

777
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,320
doesn't mean you should i i just don't

778
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,399
think this is the right thing to do we

779
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,239
shouldn't use routing to do this

780
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,640
okay uh here here checking yes sir i

781
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,679
don't know i should join the queue first

782
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,799
but uh tng uh china mobile upon is my

783
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,720
colleague who's uh presenting from

784
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,760
beijing

785
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,159
so the thing is uh we do believe you

786
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,960
know this uh work is significant and

787
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,080
involve

788
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,480
lots of routing related work

789
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,440
and then the techno details all have

790
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,960
been discussed

791
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,279
and then to make it a simple

792
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,159
you know for for some proposed solutions

793
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,559
like the diecast one or

794
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,240
they even mentioned that lb those type

795
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,279
of things

796
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,840
you know for for the cam work it's going

797
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,799
to uh include the both the compute and

798
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,440
matrix the thing is that you have to

799
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,679
collect those information through some

800
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,440
mechanism either like the igp bgp and

801
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,159
they use those information at based on

802
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,519
the architecture that's going to be

803
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,480
proposed or grid to make the decision

804
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,960
you know for the the optimal instance

805
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,679
and then about instance some joking

806
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,559
paths those type of things will be

807
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,480
like a proposed discuss all kinds of

808
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,519
things so from the actually from the the

809
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,159
very beginning the site meeting that was

810
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,080
held the last march

811
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,360
plus the buff this past march

812
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,120
you know though uh the hundred percent

813
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,519
consensus on the rotting not reached yet

814
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,880
but there are

815
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,360
significant interest from the routing

816
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,320
area this uh expert and then join the

817
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,120
discussion to you know i will see a

818
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,880
significant interest on this area thank

819
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,039
you

820
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,440
okay

821
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
okay um looks like

822
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,519
the online queue is ping and then ching

823
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,960
li and

824
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,840
then you're next

825
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
uh no no i have no no comment just to

826
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,519
wait for either okay so if you can take

827
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,039
yourself out of the queue then and then

828
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,440
i see chiang li is uh also in the online

829
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,640
queue

830
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,840
yeah can't hear me

831
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,760
please go ahead with your comment yeah

832
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,880
well i i think we we we have got a very

833
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,519
uh good beginning of the game

834
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,240
uh walk because because we have finished

835
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,960
uh buff in the previous meeting that is

836
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,080
pretty good

837
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,360
uh and then

838
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
uh different people may have different

839
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,000
view on the can walk that that's totally

840
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,279
fine and we can discuss it further

841
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,279
on the main list or

842
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,640
offline yet thank you

843
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,799
thank you uh greg mursky erickson um

844
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,279
my recollection of how their above

845
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,840
concluded was that

846
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,559
recommendation to look at existing work

847
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,000
in alta

848
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,279
and i haven't seen that proponents of

849
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,720
this work

850
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,320
uh demonstrated that alto cannot be used

851
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
for their uh what they're trying to

852
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,360
achieve

853
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,519
so without that

854
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,799
i really find hard entertain any um

855
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,559
arguments on

856
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,080
extension to igp because

857
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,119
the problem yes might be neat solved but

858
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,879
it appears

859
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,280
at least from what i understand in outer

860
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,520
that outer is reasonable mechanism and

861
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,760
already exists and with some extensions

862
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,800
seems to be quite a suitable

863
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,199
uh solution to the problem

864
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,480
which would be just one use case so

865
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,159
i would probably encourage i would

866
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,320
encourage proponents

867
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,879
to analyze outer and then if they can

868
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,760
demonstrate that yes alta is not

869
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,918
applicable to their problem

870
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,239
then

871
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,839
then probably there is a good reason to

872
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,679
spend time for the discussion and second

873
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,399
buff

874
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,719
thank you

875
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,800
lingham from fishway

876
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,839
i think right now the

877
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,079
can both has done a lot of good work

878
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,560
i think for future

879
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,760
objective

880
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,560
it's

881
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,760
necessary to make it the scope

882
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,040
clear and then we can focus in some

883
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
specific

884
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,720
user case such as a

885
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,399
cloud to uh to to

886
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
access then

887
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,400
otherwise right now the

888
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,280
some area is not very clear to to me

889
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,400
because it's kind of it's a fix mixed

890
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,760
with the

891
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,400
dynasty and also we mix with the note

892
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,960
balance so we better make this clear

893
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,280
then what is the difference with the

894
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,000
future work then we'll be good thank you

895
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,480
okay next we have dirk

896
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,000
hi i hope you can hear me um

897
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,280
yes i just wanted to um both reply to

898
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,400
greg but also um in parts to tony

899
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,520
um we did do updates on to the drafts uh

900
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,480
also from some of the updates um try to

901
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,839
clarify the positioning of doncaster's

902
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,280
non-path selection mechanism so from

903
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,800
that perspective it is

904
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,880
an aspect of load balancing pointed out

905
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,040
that it's an onpath um

906
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,640
selection rather than off our selection

907
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,880
which is also the differentiation we're

908
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
using when looking at alto

909
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,599
plus dns uh and and other of our

910
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,520
solutions so although it's covered in

911
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,560
the gap analysis part now one can

912
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,520
and maybe should expand that i do agree

913
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,760
and we're working on that and we have

914
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,880
some work that we would like to

915
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,400
integrate where we looked at a

916
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,839
comparison between one parts and off

917
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,280
parts which may answer some of the

918
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,800
questions that greg had

919
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,320
had as to

920
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,200
why

921
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,079
um

922
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,640
half-past mechanisms like alto

923
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,480
do not suffice for the use case that we

924
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,800
have in mind so the the the work has

925
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
been progressing that's the message i

926
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,599
wanted to give um there's

927
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,040
more work to be done

928
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,520
um but we're not ignoring our i mean i

929
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,280
also want to make that clear although

930
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
has actually been even in the version

931
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,000
zero already of the gap analysis back in

932
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,599
march or even last year already i think

933
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,599
it was listed already so it's not that

934
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,040
we're ignoring it we're working on

935
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,480
making it clearer

936
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,560
and and also adding potentially

937
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,160
references to

938
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,440
um

939
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,640
quantifications that come from um

940
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,079
work that has been done you know on

941
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,400
these aspects so so you know that is

942
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,040
happening at the moment and we hope that

943
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,160
some of the updates actually have

944
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,279
clarified that thank you

945
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,040
okay we have two more people in the

946
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,040
online queue and then you'll be next so

947
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,320
uh pang is next please

948
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,640
the auto issues uh we address this is in

949
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,599
the

950
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,480
analysis chart and

951
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,599
we do have some discussion into uh auto

952
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,839
rpg and

953
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,880
at this stage i think this is might also

954
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,839
be

955
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,640
open because uh auto also need to

956
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,079
do more work

957
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,520
than to to see uh if it can

958
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,400
meet the requirements or can

959
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,920
and

960
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,079
reply to used uh

961
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,480
link hands uh

962
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,839
problem that uh maybe load balance in

963
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,320
fact uh

964
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,000
is a different

965
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
aspect with

966
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,320
traffic steering of can in fact we also

967
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,040
have the comps in the in above yeah or

968
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,119
one is for the application

969
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,560
uh to to uh to meet his requirement and

970
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,040
another is uh overall

971
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,440
um

972
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,359
overall promote of the results yeah

973
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,839
that's all thank

974
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,400
you okay thanks uh changly by the way i

975
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
would um before before you start to talk

976
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,160
i'd just like to um

977
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,119
say i'm glad that we're able to use

978
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,720
this uh you know meeting time that we've

979
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,920
got to have this conversation

980
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,240
this is also the general routing area

981
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,280
open meeting so as alvaro noted earlier

982
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,320
this is

983
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,160
open mic time so if people have any

984
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,599
other topics they would like to bring up

985
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,200
they should also feel free to approach

986
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,320

it's really good

992
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,560
for us that we we still have a lot of

993
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,079
work to do so

994
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,800
it's really good and

995
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,920
we do

996
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,839
we do have done some work of the gap

997
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,640
analysis and we we do propose a new

998
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,160
draft uh

999
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,160
and then if possible please read the

1000
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,599
draft and and we we do we will be very

1001
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,280
happy to see uh guys to reply to the

1002
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,880
email that we are answering the issues

1003
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,359
that would that would make the work more

1004
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,200
effectively

1005
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,839
thank you

1006
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,880
yeah hello hello my name is george carl

1007
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,680
jones i'm working for huawei uh just a

1008
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,960
comment um uh you know i heard some

1009
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,200
opinions that during the

1010
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,800
113

1011
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,760
that it was proposed you know that can't

1012
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,200
should be

1013
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,280
based on a load balancing solution but

1014
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,760
that's not the case from what i remember

1015
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,839
there was an open discussion

1016
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,720
there there were two actually proposals

1017
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,680
that could actually work towards

1018
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,280
solving this issue

1019
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,760
one was load but balancing the other one

1020
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,079
was routing and that was an open

1021
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,480
discussion so it was not decided that

1022
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,400
load balancing should be the

1023
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,599
direction

1024
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,800
just for clarification

1025
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,240
and i'll just mention that of course

1026
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,640
we've got minutes of the meeting and

1027
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,160
recording and so on for anybody who

1028
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,040
wants to go back and review um linda

1029
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,280
please go ahead uh this is linda dumber

1030
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,520
from futureway since john you mentioned

1031
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
that we can start other broader

1032
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,240
discussion i have a question so i heard

1033
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,160
people talking about low balance right

1034
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,000
so but if you look at load balance

1035
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,680
there's there are three load balance

1036
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,359
there layer four load balance there's

1037
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,400
seven load balance right um in routing

1038
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,880
domain we always do ecmp right that's

1039
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,880
kind of low balance your balance between

1040
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,400
multiple paths

1041
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,000
so if my question is really

1042
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,119
can routing area take that kind of work

1043
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,560
like front end multiple paths balancing

1044
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,520
balancing among multiple paths

1045
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,440
would that be part of routing area

1046
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
because you do need the routing

1047
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,160
information and then the distance

1048
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,119
matrix and the destination matrix that's

1049
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,880
my question to them to the group

1050
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,119
this is a question that anybody can

1051
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,480
answer i don't think it's just addressed

1052
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,880
to the people sitting up front and i

1053
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,599
don't have like

1054
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,680
i'm not sure i i think the answer is it

1055
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,599
depends right

1056
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,640
um because like you said there's there's

1057
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,720
load balancers that exist pretty much up

1058
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,800
and down the stack and things that are

1059
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,839
close to routing

1060
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,040
probably belong in routing and things

1061
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,440
that that aren't don't

1062
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,960
you know um

1063
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,720
which is maybe not a very satisfying

1064
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,079
answer but i think i think we have to

1065
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,800
take things case by case so so um

1066
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,119
actually that's a that's a good answer

1067
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,880
in a way that

1068
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,400
load balancing if you look at

1069
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,480
traditional load balancing balancing the

1070
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,720
service instances and they have instance

1071
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,040
right behind the load balancer

1072
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,720
balancing among them that's definitely

1073
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,440
not part of the routing work right so

1074
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,200
but if you talk about network like

1075
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,839
network wise balancing among multiple

1076
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,400
paths you need protocol to exchange

1077
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,680
information

1078
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,440
maybe that's more

1079
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,000
closer to the routing area than

1080
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,280
the other

1081
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,119
areas so it's

1082
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,960
where can we start this kind of

1083
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,640
discussion and then

1084
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,118
debate

1085
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,040
how about the routing discussion mailing

1086
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,240
list

1087
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,959
okay thank you

1088
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,200
so so just to uh really quick so um

1089
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,800
there's the related

1090
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,160
topic

1091
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,319
related to can of course in the then

1092
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
cast main list as well

1093
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,440
right whether this question is

1094
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,400
appropriate

1095
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,680
if there's already a list please go

1096
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,560
there

1097
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,240
and the other thing i mean to add to

1098
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,960
what john said about it depends

1099
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,560
sure is wrongly technology fit in the

1100
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,880
routing area yes does routing related

1101
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,440
technology yes

1102
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,520
what is the specific proposal right we

1103
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,119
can't answer

1104
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,240
a definite

1105
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,079
anything else besides maybe

1106
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,400
unless there is a specific proposal

1107
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,720
right so if there is one

1108
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,839
um

1109
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,760
you know the community and everyone else

1110
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,599
can of course consider that and we can

1111
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,200
all decide whether

1112
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,280
uh it does fit or or more importantly

1113
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,400
whether uh people want to do the work

1114
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,680
which is what we should be deciding

1115
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,440
right

1116
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,680
next

1117
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,400
kenji uh chandler mobile again

1118
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,800
uh i can give you a real example about

1119
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,000
the lb load balancing not going to work

1120
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,760
uh if you look at the latest 5g

1121
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,880
architecture and then you can consider

1122
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,160
like the the upf and then there are a

1123
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,200
trend to lower down the upf to be d upf

1124
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,520
toward the edge side so if you consider

1125
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,359
this type of things they are going to

1126
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,200
have the compute as mentioned by my

1127
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,359
colleague pen the compute can be

1128
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,079
distributed across different areas like

1129
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,359
in local

1130
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,800
data network

1131
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,839
in dn owned by

1132
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,599
by mobile operators

1133
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,560
or even in public cloud side

1134
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,440
so

1135
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,000
they are also a trend in 3gpp to put

1136
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,880
some

1137
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,839
to the compute in some area even in the

1138
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,920
the core side the core network uh

1139
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,839
location side so if you consider

1140
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,160
everything together and with the skill

1141
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,400
of the number of the dupfs

1142
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,640
where are going to put the lb how are

1143
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,720
you going to process or deal with the

1144
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,319
dynamics of the the compute the load and

1145
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,480
also the the migration the quick

1146
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,960
migration of mobile subscribers

1147
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,200
so the thing the work can only be

1148
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
handled you know put everything together

1149
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,880
in a holistic we

1150
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,200
it's not just like uh i'll be yourself

1151
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,520
thank you

1152
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,280
greg mursky erickson again so since you

1153
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,040
mentioned that this is open mic and

1154
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,760
anything that seems to related to uh

1155
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,280
routing area

1156
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,280
um

1157
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,960
we had uh this um interim meeting uh in

1158
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,359
rtg on context addressing and i found

1159
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,520
very appropriately noted

1160
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,880
that

1161
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,440
work on oem

1162
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,079
usually often lags behind other

1163
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,880
documents and often the documents and

1164
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,240
technologies news introduced without

1165
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,680
defining their uh tools or extensions to

1166
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,720
existing tools preferably that help

1167
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,560
operators to work with these

1168
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,920
technologies

1169
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,520
so uh what i would like to discuss

1170
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,960
remember here

1171
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,839
start the discussion of what can be done

1172
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,560
so that

1173
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,680
these tools will be developed in

1174
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,680
step for example for security uh we have

1175
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,480
uh security consideration mandatory

1176
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,920
sections that needs to discuss potential

1177
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,319
impact not to solve the problem but at

1178
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,079
least to discuss and point to the

1179
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,040
direction where it might work need be

1180
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,960
done

1181
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,280
for example i found that interestingly

1182
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,440
we have rfc that

1183
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,760
specifically talks about

1184
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,880
manageability considerations for pce

1185
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,480
working group

1186
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,319
documents and that seems to include work

1187
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,640
on fault management and performance

1188
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,200
monitoring as part of fcaps

1189
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,319
so

1190
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,319
that might be a good start something to

1191
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,040
look at so i don't think that it needs

1192
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,119
to be a mandatory section

1193
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,560
but i think that some optional section

1194
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,359
uh would be helpful at least for us not

1195
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,160
to lose this and not to really get to

1196
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,319
the situation when we're about to close

1197
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,640
a group and a group never produced any

1198
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,640
oem related document thank you

1199
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,920
um thanks greg i think that

1200
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,680
at least from my perspective i

1201
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,520
definitely acknowledge

1202
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,119
the problem because i've certainly seen

1203
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,119
it in some of the working groups

1204
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,720
that are under me

1205
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,160
i think that

1206
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,160
the solution to this is something that i

1207
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,319
think alvaro and john and myself are

1208
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,200
going to

1209
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,720
have to take away and have a bit of a

1210
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,640
discussion with and then come back to

1211
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,720
you on on that because i do think though

1212
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,480
that it is something worth

1213
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,720
having a really good look at

1214
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,400
and thank you for the feedback it's

1215
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,520
that's much appreciated and i probably

1216
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,760
would interpret come back to you as come

1217
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:11,119
back to us yes yes you use the the group

1218
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,880
yep and then uh we have tony and then ac

1219
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,280
in the queue

1220
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,160
so my understanding of the load

1221
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,440
balancing approach was pretty

1222
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,359
straightforward there would be some

1223
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,000
mechanism for distributing instance load

1224
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,400
out to all of the access routers

1225
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,800
and then access routers would

1226
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,319
bind one subscriber to the instance the

1227
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,599
tricky part was a global database

1228
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,800
whereby that binding from subscriber to

1229
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,680
instance had to be distributed so that

1230
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,640
if the user changed his particular

1231
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,920
access router the binding was retained

1232
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,599
other than that this seemed like a very

1233
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,400
straightforward problem

1234
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,839
okay thanks um ac you're next

1235
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,680
uh my my question is where are we with

1236
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,520
the gang models that were in the cluster

1237
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,920
that were all waiting on the bfd

1238
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,200
um yang rfc

1239
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,559
better better to cover that now than in

1240
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,640
every working group that's what that's

1241
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,119
been waiting on this cluster

1242
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,119
yep i do not know off the top of my head

1243
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,480
but i will go and check and report back

1244
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,359
thanks for asking

1245
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,640
and shooping please go ahead

1246
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,599
from huawei

1247
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,119
i'm on open mac uh here is a question to

1248
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,040
our ads

1249
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,359
that's regarding the apn working group

1250
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,480
to be created and uh we know that the

1251
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,280
rough consensus has been achieved so my

1252
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,839
question is what is the timeline for

1253
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,960
this working group

1254
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,839
thank you

1255
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,800
so we just had a meeting about it up

1256
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,480
here and we think it's reasonable to try

1257
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,480
to get that done by the next itf by 115.

1258
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,200
okay thank you

1259
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,000
and the queue is empty

1260
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,960
so going once

1261
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,119
going twice and we are concluded

1262
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,599
thank you everybody

1263
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,598
or just give up

1264
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,520
see all the stuff

1265
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,400
yes

1266
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,240
you
