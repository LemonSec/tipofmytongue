uh make it easy for everyone to to hear

12
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,519
and see that'd be great

13
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,160
um

14
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,800
so let me start by welcoming all of you

15
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,200
to the uh to the hackathon it's great

16
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,920
great to be back here and to be able to

17
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,760
meet in person again

18
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,800
uh

19
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,480
we met for the first time in person

20
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,120
after not meeting for a couple years

21
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,800
right in vienna

22
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,959
and we had i think about 100 or so

23
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,480
people there i think where it looks like

24
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,000
we're going to have about double that

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
here

26
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,040
so that's fantastic to see i'm super

27
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,760
excited about it i hope you are too

28
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,640
um

29
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,480
just wanted to get a quick show of hands

30
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,080
for how many of you this is your first

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
time at an ietf hackathon

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,560
okay

33
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
i i thought there were a lot of faces i

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,640
didn't recognize and uh part of it i

35
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,560
thought was because of mass and covid

36
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,239
but uh but yeah we actually do have a

37
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,959
lot of new people so so welcome i i hope

38
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
this is a great experience for you i

39
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,200
hope you really enjoy it i

40
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,840
we're we're a great group of uh people

41
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,159
here at the hackathon so feel free to

42
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,760
reach out to those around you and and

43
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,519
those of you who saw another newcomer

44
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,439
here you know

45
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,200
maybe just go that little extra step to

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,280
introduce yourself and and help make

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
sure that uh that everyone gets involved

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
in a project uh that'd be great

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,120
um

50
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,640
and then so how many of you this is your

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,319
first time to ever be in any type of

52
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,080
ietf event

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
it's oh almost the same yeah okay

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
well uh i think you came to the right

55
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,759
place i'm a little biased because i've

56
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,199
been running the hackathon for a while

57
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,959
now but but i think it's a great

58
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,680
introduction into the ietf and a great

59
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,720
way to

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,440
you know really start getting involved

61
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,680
right away around around code that's

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
implementing the standards we're doing

63
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
that's a big part of the hackathon so

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
um so i think you made a great choice

65
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,440
and i'm glad you're here

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
and then

67
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,280
you know

68
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
kovit things are getting better every

69
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,600
day still fortunately some up and downs

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
but uh i'm wondering how many of you

71
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,880
this is your first time at an in-person

72
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,320
event since

73
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,840
uh coveted

74
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,240
so we have a number of that too so

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,759
uh

76
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,639
you know i'm glad you're here um for for

77
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,320
those of you who have had a little bit

78
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
more experience with this think back to

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,919
the first time you were at an in-person

80
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,039
event um since covet started and so you

81
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,400
know we all have different comfort

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
levels with with kovid

83
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,759
and

84
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,520
you know the ietf meeting we have some

85
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
pretty strict rules that are a little

86
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
stricter than what you may be used to at

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,919
conferences um

88
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,560
it it's okay to not wear a mask when

89
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,960
you're presenting uh it's like when i'm

90
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
presenting today or tomorrow when we do

91
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,199
the presentations it's okay to not wear

92
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,880
a mask obviously when you're eating or

93
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,080
drinking

94
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,000
but uh but we have been asked to wear

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,720
masks otherwise so when you're in this

96
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,240
room when you're working try to keep

97
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,919
your mask on unless you're eating or

98
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,720
drinking when you leave the room

99
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
and go out into the hallway please make

100
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
sure you have a mask on we're trying to

101
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,320
keep mass you know within the ietf venue

102
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,039
as much as possible so just to keep us

103
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
all safe since there there will uh

104
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,120
thankfully be a large number of us here

105
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
so well you know let's do what we can to

106
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,360
follow those rules and especially for

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
those people who uh this is their first

108
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,039
event since cove would make it a little

109
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,120
bit easier for them too but but really

110
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
easier for all of us

111
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,240
so

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,319
you know the reason we're here is i

113
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,280
mentioned this a little bit at the

114
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
beginning this is really we want to

115
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
advance the pace and relevance of all

116
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,440
the work we do in the ietf

117
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
you know we do a lot of great work with

118
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,400
standards i think our standards

119
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
fortunately get get implemented and

120
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,319
deployed and run the internet that's

121
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,280
fantastic but by by working on them by

122
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
implementing them at the same time that

123
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,680
we're we're writing them and improving

124
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,360
them you know we really get the best of

125
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,960
both worlds and we make you know we

126
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
create some code that people can use to

127
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,440
help them in their deployment um so

128
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
that's really fantastic so i'm glad

129
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
you're here and also another big part of

130
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,720
the hackathon is to to extend the ietf

131
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,280
community and to to welcome new people

132
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,960
into it and and i think you saw with the

133
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
show of hands we're we're doing well in

134
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
that regard as well

135
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,560
um

136
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,199
lars are you here

137
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,759
yeah lars um i'd like to

138
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,440
welcome the itf chair uh lars up he's

139
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,759
a huge supporter and participator in the

140
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
hackathon and uh

141
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,360
mike is yours

142
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
thank you hi i'm lars eckerda charity

143
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,520
iatf and thanks charles and thanks all

144
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,599
of you for being here um i don't quite

145
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,560
remember how long we've been doing

146
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,080
hackathons but must be well over 10

147
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,919
years now and i think

148
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,240
2015 so not it feels like 10 years but

149
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
but not quite uh but they've certainly

150
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,280
sort of become

151
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,639
like really one of the best events i

152
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,080
think around the itf in my opinion

153
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
because this is sort of what it's all

154
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,680
about right it's like actually getting

155
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,479
stuff

156
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,319
done and shipped and deployed and

157
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,319
interoperable and while we do that

158
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,919
during the week as well right there we

159
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,360
care mostly about the technical

160
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,440
standards and then you know writing

161
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
english that's correct and easy to

162
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
implement but here we actually write

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,280
code which is a little bit closer to um

164
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,879
what we all want to do i think rather in

165
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,120
writing specs writing code feels like

166
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
more fulfilling um

167
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,879
i also want to say that we have had a

168
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,319
sort of separate event for a while

169
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,639
called the itf tools code sprint

170
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,879
which has been in a different room up

171
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,440
until now sort of as an experiment this

172
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,879
time we sort of

173
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,039
relocated that here so it's the table

174
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,879
over there that i'm also hanging out

175
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,080
those are the people that work on the

176
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,319
tools that make the itf work the data

177
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,680
tracker xml to rfc mail archive and so

178
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,360
on so if you have an interest in that

179
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,280
come say hi and and if they have bugs

180
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
file them and we'll hopefully get them

181
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
fixed for you um

182
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
the other thing i want to mention is

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,399
that uh there was a noisy piece of

184
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,760
equipment in that corner the door got

185
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,360
closed so there's a group up here that's

186
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,120
doing l4s which is a new congestion

187
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
control thing for the internet that

188
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,240
originated

189
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
on the research side a couple years ago

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,440
and it's now sort of getting close to

191
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
deployment so there's people from

192
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
comcast who are also sponsoring the

193
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,440
meeting

194
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,800
i think there's some operators involved

195
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
i think bt

196
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
as well there's um i think apple and

197
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,120
meta and google and some other um people

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
who have end systems and then they're

199
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,880
going to try and actually get this into

200
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,240
operate so if that's of interest to you

201
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,560
come and say hi um take a look at the

202
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,080
rack it's pretty impressive if you want

203
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,240
to bring equipment you can so this was a

204
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,600
good example

205
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
just let us know ahead of time like

206
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,560
these guys did and then we'll figure out

207
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,880
how to make that work for you

208
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
otherwise enjoy the day keep your mess

209
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,480
on please we already had a corona case

210
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,920
this morning reported so it's a thing

211
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,360
it's for your safety it's for other

212
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,959
people's safety we want to keep the

213
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,640
number down

214
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,279
in vienna we had i think around five

215
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,680
people over the course of the week which

216
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,640
is

217
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
a unfortunately high number but it's

218
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,160
actually a low number compared to what

219
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,519
the corona people in vienna were

220
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,080
expecting to see so i'm hoping that we

221
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,240
can leave philadelphia and also have the

222
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,399
absolute minimum number of exposures

223
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
that we can manage for meeting this size

224
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,399
um enjoy today

225
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,480
enjoy the company write some code and

226
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,760
then i'll see you during the week thank

227
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,920
you

228
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,800
all right

229
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,120
thank you lars

230
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,440
okay so um

231
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
you know just a reminder especially for

232
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,600
those of you who are new to

233
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
ietf but really for everything for

234
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,920
everyone everything we do in ietf falls

235
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,800
under the the note well it's good to if

236
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,079
you haven't already made yourself

237
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,399
familiar with this it's uh

238
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,240
good to familiarize yourself with it it

239
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
you know

240
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,640
it talks about the

241
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
rules and procedures of the ietf what it

242
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,720
means to participate in the ietf so um

243
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,880
you know good to take a look at that one

244
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,680
thing that it doesn't really uh that is

245
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,560
a little different though is is uh

246
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
around code because what you present in

247
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
an ietf meeting that's all an ietf

248
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,120
contribution but the code that you work

249
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,560
on is a little bit different in that

250
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,440
there's

251
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,519
usually hopefully a license associated

252
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,720
with it and so you also need to be aware

253
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
of the the rules and the requirements

254
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,600
and the obligations that you have when

255
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
using that code base and extending that

256
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
code base so so be sure to pay attention

257
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
to the the license of the code that

258
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
you're working on because that code base

259
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,399
is not actually an

260
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,640
ietf contribution it's it's governed by

261
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,240
the the license of the code that you're

262
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,720
working on but the presentations that

263
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,959
that we do and that i'm doing now that

264
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,680
you'll do uh tomorrow hopefully you know

265
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
that that does fall under the normal

266
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,480
ietf rules and is an ietf contribution

267
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,079
so if you're not familiar with the note

268
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,519
well i i

269
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
recommend you do that

270
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,000
uh now project so we have a lot of great

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
projects you heard about one that i'm

272
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
super excited a couple actually that i'm

273
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,120
really excited to have here the code

274
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,440
sprint and the l4s project

275
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
but we have a lot of other great

276
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,920
projects too

277
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
they are all listed on the wiki if you

278
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
haven't taken a look at all those

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,519
projects or figured out which one you

280
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,760
want to work on

281
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
i suggest you do that now take a look at

282
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
the wiki we had we have over 20 projects

283
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,120
and uh the the name of the champion and

284
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,440
kind of what the project is about is

285
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,600
there and then you can just go find that

286
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
table and and talk with those people

287
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,399
if you are having a hard time finding a

288
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,639
project we have a a

289
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,120
a wiki page called the lost and found

290
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,639
and that's kind of to serve a couple

291
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,720
purposes one is if you're

292
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
if you're looking for people with partic

293
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,880
particular expertise to join your

294
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
project you can advertise that there if

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,079
you're looking to help a project and you

296
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,560
have like some some uh things that

297
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,000
you're interested in or skills you can

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,880
offer

299
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
you can put that there as well so it's

300
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,040
that it's to help match uh people the

301
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
projects

302
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,200
okay the agenda we are running uh pretty

303
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,760
much on time and uh you can see where we

304
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,000
are on the agenda we're doing a quick uh

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,600
kickoff here

306
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,639
and then

307
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,720
um you know really this first part of

308
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,600
the morning is uh take some extra time

309
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
to make sure that we get our teams

310
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
formed

311
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,800
that um

312
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,639
and if you haven't found a team you can

313
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,399
come and you need some help you can come

314
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,000
talk to me but really talk to those

315
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,120
around you

316
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
and uh and let's try to make sure that

317
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,519
everyone finds a team that they are

318
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,959
comfortable in that they feel they can

319
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,320
contribute to

320
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,160
because uh you know that's the best way

321
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
to make the

322
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,320
the best use of this weekend if um if

323
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,440
you're have if you're struggling with

324
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,360
that don't just you know stay quiet

325
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,200
about it reach out and ask for some help

326
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
there's many of us here who are familiar

327
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,880
with a lot of the people in a lot of the

328
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,480
projects and can help you get situated

329
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,079
in order to make it easy for you to

330
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,680
continue to work on your projects

331
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,079
throughout the day lunch will be served

332
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,680
out where you saw the snacks this

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,639
network and all that but we just need to

351
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,639
close this room and let the hotel staff

the main thing i want to call your

363
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,880
attention to is that we will be doing

364
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,120
these project presentations

365
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
starting at 2 o'clock where you can give

366
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,079
a brief um overview of what you did and

367
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,440
what you accomplished and what you

368
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,720
learned

369
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,279
those will start at two o'clock so keep

370
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,440
that in mind that a little bit before

371
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,320
two

372
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,120
or maybe a while before two you wanna be

373
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
starting to put together a a short

374
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
presentation um those are short just

375
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
like four minutes i'll talk about those

376
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,079
a little bit in a minute but just in

377
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,320
terms of the the timing i wanted to

378
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,519
point that out

379
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,440
and then at four o'clock we we want to

380
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
be done here with all those

381
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
presentations because there's other

382
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
activities like newcomers

383
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,279
uh events and uh

384
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,480
and the

385
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
the welcome reception we want to make

386
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,800
sure everyone has time to get to those

387
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,720
yeah if you did have some equipment that

388
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,920
you brought in

389
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
and you've set it up in here

390
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
you can leave it overnight if you're

391
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,759
comfortable doing that but we do ask

392
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,839
that by five o'clock you have it out of

393
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,240
here so this room can be turned over and

394
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
into the next uh kind of setup that it's

395
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,639
going to have

396
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,079
any questions about the agenda

397
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,199
okay

398
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,000
so

399
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,759
uh as we started using gather um as a

400
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,920
way to interact especially with people

401
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,680
who aren't here in person but even for

402
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,759
those who are here in person

403
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,759
um we have the the

404
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,759
the gather space that you can go to and

405
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,519
there's kind of the virtual ietf in

406
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,000
there what i'm showing here is from 113

407
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,800
but it'll look very similar for 114.

408
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
uh just don't have the updated slides

409
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,000
for that

410
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
um there is you'll see uh some arrows

411
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
here i lit up in red pointing to where

412
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,639
the hackathon room is there's a virtual

413
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,040
hackathon room if you

414
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,720
move over there with your little

415
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,040
character you can go into the hackathon

416
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,720
room the hackathon room looks a little

417
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,160
similar to this and has tables

418
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,920
especially if you're working where you

419
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,759
have some remote participants in your

420
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,639
team

421
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,160
you um

422
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
you may want to and i welcome you to go

423
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,440
ahead and

424
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,839
you know pick out one of these tables

425
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,399
and you can kind of assign you know you

426
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,480
can say hey table a is going to be for

427
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,199
us

428
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,519
and whatever your team name is and you

429
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,199
can so you can use that as a virtual

430
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,959
meeting space where the people here in

431
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,800
the room and and the people who are

432
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,920
working online can can have a

433
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,839
you know a space to meet and you can

434
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,440
share documents within there you can

435
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,039
share notes there's some nice

436
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,199
capabilities within it to help you

437
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,520
collaborate with you know especially

438
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,720
with remote participants

439
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,520
and i think i forgot to mention it but

440
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,520
there is a let me go back to the agenda

441
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,919
there is this team schedule

442
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,559
um and you can put down in that team

443
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,480
schedule it's another wiki page and

444
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,760
especially if you have remote

445
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
participants it's good to say well these

446
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,559
particular hours this is when we're

447
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,200
going to have sort of a meeting between

448
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,360
the virtual and the people in the room

449
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,880
or for the people who are working

450
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,640
virtually this is the way to communicate

451
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
with the people in the room you can use

452
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
whatever you want you can use gather and

453
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,160
i just you know showed that and you can

454
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,400
pick a table you can say we're at table

455
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
a or you can set up a zoom session you

456
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,240
can you know use webex you can do

457
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,080
whatever you're comfortable with

458
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,760
just uh this

459
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,520
team schedule is a way to capture that

460
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,160
and share that

461
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,080
so going forward again we talked about

462
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,280
gather

463
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,360
hacknet that's another cool capability

464
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,720
we have this lets you connect

465
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,799
especially for people who are remote to

466
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,240
connect into

467
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,559
a virtual ietf network but even for

468
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
those of you who are here if you want

469
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,840
something special um it effectively is a

470
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,160
layer 2 network and we can offer some

471
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,320
some interesting capabilities beyond

472
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,000
what you would typically get when you

473
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
you just sign in via wi-fi to the ietf

474
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,799
network and we can allocate that that

475
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,360
out to you so if you have special

476
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
requirements for your project which some

477
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,720
of you have because you're working on

478
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
networking protocols

479
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
you can make requests

480
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
to get that set up and we can get that

481
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,760
set up for you

482
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,520
i mentioned the results presentations so

483
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,840
these are very short presentations where

484
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,400
you just give a high level of what you

485
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,080
tried to do what you actually

486
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,320
accomplished what you learned

487
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,400
that type of thing and it's a great way

488
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,559
to share just briefly with the ietf

489
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,400
community so they we have a little bit

490
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,679
better understanding of of your project

491
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,919
and because we we're probably going to

492
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,520
have a lot of these and we want to get

493
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,799
through them all

494
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
we we keep them to four minutes and we

495
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,880
will be pretty strict on that

496
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,440
we'll start a timer and so

497
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,320
you know when you're putting these

498
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,480
presentations together just i'm giving

499
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,559
you a heads up now do keep them short

500
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,640
less than four minutes is great

501
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
um but definitely no more than four

502
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,360
minutes so just to give us a high level

503
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,160
idea of what you accomplished and i'll

504
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,840
talk in a minute about a way you can

505
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,000
give like a more extended presentation

506
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
but this is kind of the quick one just

507
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
to introduce people to your project and

508
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,559
and kind of get you know ongoing

509
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,280
communication going

510
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,039
okay since we are working on code

511
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,320
perhaps you need a place to to keep uh

512
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,919
to kind of host the software you're

513
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,280
working on

514
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,159
if you do need a space for your project

515
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,679
and you don't already you've not already

516
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,000
figured out like a place on github or

517
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,600
elsewhere to to host it we can create a

518
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,120
repo for you within the ietf hackathon

519
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,039
github organization we're happy to do

520
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,760
that if you want that you can just

521
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,039
come see me or send a message to

522
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,679
the hackathon chairs list and barry and

523
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,159
i will take care of that

524
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,840
we have a

525
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,240
a repo set up specifically for the

526
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,360
project presentations though so if you

527
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,440
are interested in presenting your

528
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,960
project this is where you will upload uh

529
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,640
that project presentation so that we

530
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,320
have all of them available at two

531
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,080
o'clock tomorrow when it comes time to

532
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,240
do those

533
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,159
if you go into that repo you'll find a

534
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,039
couple things one is

535
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,039
a couple templates which you're welcome

536
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,440
to use one is a html template the other

537
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
is a powerpoint template you can use

538
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,039
those as just a template to help you

539
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,360
put together your project presentation

540
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,400
um

541
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080
a lot of people have found those useful

542
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,159
in the past and i i recommend you take a

543
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,679
look because it it kind of just gives

544
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,440
you an idea of sort of the high level

545
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,120
format and type of information we're

546
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,480
looking for

547
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,080
the other thing that's in there is this

548
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,520
readme file

549
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,720
and you should always read readme files

550
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,559
and what this one will tell you was

551
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,159
it'll give you a bit more information

552
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,159
about the templates but it's also going

553
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,720
to tell you that

554
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,200
in in order to make things simple rather

555
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,799
than do the normal github thing of

556
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,400
sending a pull request and having

557
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,880
someone review it and then approve it

558
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,520
we want to make give all of you access

559
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
to to be committers

560
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
so all of you can upload your own

561
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,080
presentations in order to make that work

562
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,280
you need to become a member of the ietf

563
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,559
hackathon organization within github

564
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,840
so you can request that membership

565
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,720
barry and i probably barry he's been

566
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
quick to respond to those

567
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,600
can get you added to that group and if

568
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,120
you think you're going to be presenting

569
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,280
if you aren't already in the ietf github

570
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
organization make that request sooner

571
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,960
rather than later so we can get you

572
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,200
added now and you just get your access

573
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,280
set up and out of the way because if you

574
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,520
wait until two o'clock tomorrow

575
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
things are going to get busy and

576
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,840
uh something might fall off the table we

577
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,600
won't get you set up right

578
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,280
there's also some rules there like we

579
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,120
want to make sure we know who everyone

580
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,440
is so if you can as part of your github

581
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,600
account if you haven't already make sure

582
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,840
you put down the name that that you want

583
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,200
that you go by

584
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,280
so that we'll know who's who

585
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,960
and also enable two-factor

586
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,520
authentication just so that we don't you

587
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,200
know we get a little bit more security

588
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,559
as to who we're giving right access to

589
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,320
the the ietf hackathon org

590
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,000
and if you have any questions about that

591
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
you can come see me you can come see

592
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,840
barry

593
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,480
one other thing i want to point out is

594
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,440
we're we're really trying to make uh

595
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,280
advance the pace of the work we're doing

596
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,919
right and so by a lot of this is about

597
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,480
code and many of you thankfully for your

598
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,880
projects you have links to

599
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
uh the code where to find the code

600
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,880
associated with your project on the ietf

601
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,760
hackathon wiki and that's fantastic but

602
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,600
for those who who aren't here those who

603
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
are going to go and read the drafts and

604
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,919
the rfcs we want them to be able to find

605
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,000
that code too so this related

606
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,919
implementations this is something great

607
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,600
that actually the

608
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,919
the the tools team and i forget if it

609
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,080
came out of a code sprint last time but

610
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,240
it got implemented by some of the same

611
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,200
folks

612
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,880
they enabled this functionality and

613
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,200
that's where you can make use of this

614
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
additional resources if you go to the

615
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,799
data tracker you'll see something called

616
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,360
additional resources and and i've used

617
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,000
that before to associate um to tell you

618
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,960
where my

619
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,760
uh that my draft is in github but now

620
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,279
there's a new thing called related

621
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,000
implementations and you can do use this

622
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,559
to indicate where code related to that

623
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,960
draft is associated and you can put one

624
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,480
or more of these depending on if you

625
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,200
have more than one code project

626
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,240
but

627
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
if you click on edit it'll bring you to

628
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,320
a page like this and sorry it's a little

629
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,240
small but you can download these uh

630
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,600
these slides and see it a little bit

631
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,559
better

632
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,400
and you can you can add in one of these

633
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,039
related implementations and then uh the

634
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,279
the address of where the code is in a

635
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,279
little text description so it's really

636
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,279
handy it helps people find code related

637
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,159
to the draft that you're working on

638
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,200
i think this is great functionality i

639
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,039
would really recommend and ask that you

640
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,520
make use of it and hopefully we get

641
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,159
people more accustomed to this idea of

642
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,080
there being running code associated with

643
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,480
drafts and with rfcs i think that would

644
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,200
be fantastic

645
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,240
okay just a couple more things

646
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,000
i mentioned the hackathon ends it you

647
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,320
know tomorrow afternoon

648
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,679
and we have these really short

649
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,080
presentations well if you want to give a

650
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,240
more extended presentation if you want

651
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,039
time for like engaging with the entire

652
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,360
ietf community not just those in this

653
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,279
room and you want more time we have this

654
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,679
thing called hack demo happy hour and

655
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
that will be monday

656
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,960
evening from 5 30 to 6 30. you can sign

657
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,679
up um it's actually in this same room

658
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,000
this is liberty a it'll be in this room

659
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,400
we'll have tables set up you can um have

660
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,480
demos of your project and you can really

661
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,039
engage one-on-one with people for longer

662
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,120
periods of time right so you can have

663
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,880
that more in-depth conversation that you

664
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,640
