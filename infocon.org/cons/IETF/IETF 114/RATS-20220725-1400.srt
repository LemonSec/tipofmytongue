where maybe some wires

27
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,600

38
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,759

the first slide as this comes up is just

154
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,880
the same thing we've shown in many

the giraffes the relationship between

158
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
the architecture draft the relationship

159
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,320
to the reference model draft

160
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,800
and the relationships between the um

161
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,519
charge raft the subscription draft and

162
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,839

when it comes up is that

165
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,440
we're

166
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,040
we have the architecture draft as you

167
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
guys know going through various reviews

168
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,240
and

169
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,839
it's progressing well we have a

170
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,680
dependency on

171
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,720
chara

172
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
and chara is now through

173
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,160
to the

174
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,480
rc editor's queue i think and that's

175
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,399
moving fine

176
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,519
next up

177
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,519
is subscription draft and i think it's

178
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,120
about to come up right now

179
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,040
the subscription draft pretty much is

180
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,120
ready to progress now that we have a

181
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,320
stable

182
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,720
architecture we have a stable

183
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
eat draft and we're also basing it off

184
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,560
subscriptions from the netcomp working

185
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,959
group which is going right next door

186
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,320
and what we're going to do now is just

187
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
we need to write up some information in

188
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
the security considerations text

189
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,920
and then it's ready for working group

190
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,360
last call because all the other parts i

191
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,680
think are stable at this point

192
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,800
and

193
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,320
and that's pretty much a summary of

194
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
where we're at there's not been a whole

195
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,519
lot of progress as we've been waiting

196
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,959
the closure of the dependent elements

197
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,399
and so

198
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,600
in the next

199
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,519
months or so hopefully we'll get the

200
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,600
security considerations right

201
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,920
put out to everybody and then they can

202
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,240
go through and do a

203
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,839
working group last call review i hope i

204
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,519
think that's where we're at

205
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,279
so without any slides i think that was

206
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,519
the summary of the subscription draft i

207
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,959
can keep on moving unless anybody has

208
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,399
any questions i don't think there's

209
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,560
anything very controversial about it

210
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,920
unless i'm missing something

211
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
have we had any uh people review the

212
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,240
draft

213
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,320
previously that's how we got here we

214
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,760
haven't had any real reviews in the last

215
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,959
probably almost six months or so so

216
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,720
uh certainly is very welcome to have as

217
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,399
many reviews and many people jumping in

218
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,440
as possible that'd be great

219
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,000
go

220
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,920
yeah so this is hank um yeah so the

221
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,399
review i think most reviews have been

222
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
done on the yang side

223
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
of course because it's

224
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,079
so um there are some

225
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,959
tooling issues so if you see errors

226
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,120
these are okay

227
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,720
unless

228
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,120
they are not okay anymore but i think

229
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,680
we will establish this on the list twice

230
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
that it's a local tool chain problem and

231
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,639
not a problem with the actual young

232
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,680
module so don't be scared by that um

233
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
having said that um yes security

234
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,880
considerations is one of the last open

235
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,720
topics so to speak so maybe polishing

236
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,079
and updating those

237
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,760
we could trigger

238
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
other reviews that are not

239
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,199
security-centric though

240
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,480
can we benefit if i triggered or is it

241
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
one of the chairs

242
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
please that would be great yeah exactly

243
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,839
that's what i was hinting at perfect

244
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,480
cool

245
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,199
that would be awesome

246
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,880
all right so in the interest of time

247
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
because i know we're poking at slides

248
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
i'm going to give the

249
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,360
our 4c

250
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,720
slides from memory

251
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,959
basically our 4c is also progressing

252
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,519
there have been a number of dialogues

253
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,040
that have occurred

254
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,839
for

255
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,360
various areas one of the big things

256
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
that's happened happening is outside of

257
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,480
the working group

258
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
and we have dave taylor who's in the

259
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
room right now we're hoping to get some

260
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,639
stable uh

261
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,959
terminology out of the confidential

262
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,399
compute consortium

263
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,199
and we're hoping to go ahead and update

264
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,440
the r4z using the terminology that's

265
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
been discussed over

266
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,360
in the confidential computing consortium

267
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,120
we don't see a need to rush to get the

268
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
closure until that's closed

269
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,839
then we'll update the draft there

270
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,959
so that's one of the things we've been

271
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,120
trying to do with r4z second thing we've

272
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,800
been trying to do with our foresee is

273
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,560
continue dialogues

274
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
with the eat draft on a couple of

275
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
different topics this includes things

276
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
like security level which has been sort

277
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,000
of going back and forth for a long time

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,639
as people know following the group

279
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,079
and uh one of the things that has

280
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,759
happened which is a plus

281
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,079
is uh we agreed uh i don't know how many

282
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,759
months ago maybe four or five months ago

283
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,959
at this point

284
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,639
to include a couple different new

285
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,399
hardware types in the draft and the next

286
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,040
rewrite that matched to some of the uh

287
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,560
cpe types

288
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,680
that are

289
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,800
relevant

290
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,279
to some of the use cases driving the eat

291
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,320
draft

292
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160
so we still have security level stuff

293
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,720
open but we have been able to at least

294
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,920
recognize that we need some more

295
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,880
hardware types in the in the uh our

296
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,399
forcey draft

297
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,279
uh the last bit and uh i hopefully can

298
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,240
bring up the slides for the last slide

299
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,759
trying to get there

300
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,959
um

301
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,199
there is dialogue um going for

302
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,079
what is the right way to

303
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,759
integrate with eat

304
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,680
i do think that we're awaiting some of

305
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,519
the disposition on some of the questions

306
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,000
in there we've proposed at least a

307
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
skeleton for what it would take to put

308
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,599
our 4z claims

309
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,720
in each syntax and there was some

310
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,439
stuff going in the last slide talking

311
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,039
about what those syntaxes might look

312
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,400
like

313
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,799
but we're going to wait on the closure

314
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,319
of some of the other larger questions

315
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,919
with eat which i'm sure we'll hear about

316
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,520
in future slides

317
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,199
so with that said i think i've talked

318
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,640
about the slides from memory i don't

319
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,319
know if there's anything else

320
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,439
people have

321
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,520
since they're not on the screen here but

322
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
open up for other questions if people

323
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,840
have them

324
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,640
so my question is have you gotten any

325
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,640
substantive comments on this drive

326
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,160
we've had a lot of comments early on

327
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,640
it's revved a number of times early on

328
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,960
in the last three months it's really big

329
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
just been iterating on

330
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,840
overlaps with the eat side so i'd say

331
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
that there are some

332
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,520
rel now we're there

333
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,320
um

334
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,080
i think there have been some substance

335
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,720
comments as i mentioned we introduced uh

336
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
or want to introduce some new stuff as

337
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,320
it relates to hardware types

338
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,160
there's been comments and iterations on

339
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,320
stuff on the confidential compute side

340
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,679
they haven't been actual

341
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,160
debates over single word texts in the

342
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
r4c but some of the base concepts have

343
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,400
certainly been iterated in the last

344
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,000
not months

345
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,679
i see hank waiting here

346
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,280
yeah so again this is saying um yeah

347
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,679
that you mentioned the um confidential

348
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,480
um computing consortium i think

349
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
review from over there it would be very

350
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,039
appreciated i think in the last half

351
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,240
year

352
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
some of the problem statements converged

353
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,039
and as the cccc is relatively uh

354
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,880
application

355
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,360
fine i would say uh some feedback from

356
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,559
that area

357
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,360
uh would be nice but so yeah yeah

358
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
but we have to go to them i assume and

359
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
then just ask there and probably slide

360
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,120
before this one is the one to end on

361
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,160
because that was kind of what we were

362
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
just talking about future integration

363
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,240
based on you talked about comments we

364
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,559
had the drafts that i'd look is uh

365
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,160
to look for for substantive comments

366
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,919
would be some claims and evidence and

367
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,360
results threads

368
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,080
and the profiles threads which are very

369
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,679
relevant to

370
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,840
how do we determine integration over

371
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
time

372
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
dave taylor so this is on my reading

373
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,160
list i have not reviewed the latest

374
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,440
document i think i reviewed it when it

375
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,880
was like draft zero zero or something

376
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,600
like that in previous ietf but um

377
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,799
so this may be answered in there but i

378
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,080
am one of the people that yes i will

379
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
review this one and may in fact use it

380
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,000
my question has to do with the use of uh

381
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,480
profiles and what the current thinking

382
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,080
is if you can summarize that so for

383
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,679
example in teep

384
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,520
teep defines a profile there because it

385
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,360
has a relying party and the profile and

386
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,799
teep says here's what the relying party

387
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,919
needs in attestation results

388
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,679
how does that interact with what might

389
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,400
be in the air for si would you have a

390
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,240
profile in here or would you say that

391
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,000
this is a template for other profiles to

392
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,120
use

393
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,600
it's a very good question the question

394
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,840
on profiles is a slightly different

395
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,880
perspective for how we took the

396
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,799
definition of the claims versus let's

397
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,320
say the way it does the definition of

398
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,600
the claims

399
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,880
we from the r4c standpoint take the

400
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,080
perspective

401
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,480
that the definitions of the claims will

402
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,720
always be in attestation results and

403
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,360
they should not require a profile for

404
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,600
any variation in the meaning of the

405
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,720
claims

406
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
so we're hoping that where our forza is

407
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,240
used

408
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,000
they would be pretty much the same

409
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,159
definitions as

410
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,400
uh used in any use case with in other

411
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,039
words they're not really varying their

412
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,120
meanings based on the profile or so that

413
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,039
you'll be able to pick up the claims

414
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,960
in a particular profile

415
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,360
and that's the the

416
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,840
prerequisites for i guess the next slide

417
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,919
which talks about design considerations

418
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,280
they certainly can be picked up by

419
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,640
profiles

420
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
um and i have no problem with being

421
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
picked up by profiles i'm kind of

422
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,679
waiting to see where the profiles

423
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,240
discussion comes before trying to adjust

424
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,200
any terminology against that

425
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,320
okay so i just want to make sure i

426
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,159
understand the answer that you're saying

427
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,799
the answer is uh still a bit flexible if

428
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,720
needed but you see this is uh replacing

429
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,320
the need for other profiles for people

430
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
that use attestation results that you'd

431
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,600
use this or

432
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
some custom profile if this didn't work

433
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,400
for you you wouldn't try to use them

434
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,080
both together and sort of subclass this

435
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,039
or something i think is your answer

436
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,520
correctly um close i'd say that there's

437
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,200
a valid overlap

438
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
between the use cases of attestation

439
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
results and i don't think the

440
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
definitions of the trustworthiness

441
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,799
claims are flexible

442
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,400
if they're used they should probably

443
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
mean the same things everywhere so it

444
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,919
you're not really worrying about

445
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,320
namespace or other kind of discussions

446
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,799
because the definitions are

447
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,480
fairly fixed and i see one question

448
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,679
coming in from lawrence but that's

449
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,159
that's my belief at this point with r4c

450
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,320
yeah because a neat profile does a lot

451
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,000
more than you specify which claims they

452
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,280
are right there's a whole bunch of other

453
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,200
axes that are part of the profile right

454
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,520
and so is your intent to dictate those

455
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,120
there because the other variation would

456
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
be you take the claims out of this one

457
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,640
and you use a different variation of

458
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,320
like whether it supports the what

459
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,559
detachable or whatever the term is or

460
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,919
the other variations that are in the

461
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,159
profile yeah so that's what i meant by

462
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,600
templates it could be augmenting

463
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,039
additional claims it could be changing

464
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,080
any one of those other things without

465
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,320
touching the claims yeah if you knew the

466
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,159
slide previous i'll just close on this

467
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,159
question as you can see when it's clear

468
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,080
how profiles we're going to be very

469
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,159
happy to add a section showing eating

470
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,640
codings in that case to be very open to

471
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,799
be used in profile so i see no conflict

472
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,880
for any of these claims to be used as

473
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
claims we're just waiting to see how

474
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
profiles plays out before putting the

475
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,360
text in

476
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,159
yeah so the uh lawrence linblade

477
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,200
um

478
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,320
yeah so

479
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,919
the bulk of the

480
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,919
profile issues in eat

481
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,240
don't really have to do with refinement

482
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,960
or

483
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,720
meaning of claims really claims

484
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,760
shouldn't be varying very much at all

485
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,480
and

486
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,240
we would like the definitions of claims

487
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,000
to be sharp and

488
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,480
broadly understood so the profile really

489
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,520
comes in comes in because of

490
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,480
variability in sibor

491
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,280
variability in choosing seaboard versus

492
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,120
json variability in cosec because of all

493
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,039
the algorithms that you can choose

494
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,919
variability in jose because of all the

495
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,520
variability there

496
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,080
and the requirement or non-requirement

497
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,760
where it does really

498
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,159
apply to claims it's it's a

499
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,720
a prohibition of claims or a requirement

500
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,600
of claims and possibly a refinement of

501
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,840
claims but really it's about a lot of

502
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,760
the other stuff then then the actual

503
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,520
semantics of a claim

504
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,159
this is really an eat uh question rather

505
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,400
than an or forcy question so i'm happy

506
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,960
to defer it i do think that the

507
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
meaning of a claim such as security

508
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,240
level changes whether it's coming from

509
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,919
an attester or endorser or lying party

510
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,600
and there's still a namespace question

511
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,679
of how do you interpret

512
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,200
the object

513
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,880
but uh

514
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
but we're getting into eat here rather

515
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,200
than no no actually i don't i mean i

516
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,320
think ar uh 4rc also

517
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,120
uh

518
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,440
has variables uh syntax or encoding like

519
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,760
you could encode uh

520
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,919
uh i'm sorry i'm saying it wrong you

521
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,600
could encode that in cbor or json or

522
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,440
yang and all that so you could see you

523
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,039
could secure it with different ways and

524
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,279
all that right so that's

525
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,240
just

526
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,320
yeah i see the difference between coding

527
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
and namespace and i'm asserting that the

528
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,960
namespace is the variation here between

529
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,279
different assertors

530
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,760
so hi this is hank um just as a

531
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,600
co-author i want to make one thing very

532
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,480
clear

533
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,120
these claims will never belong in

534
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,159
evidence yes never belong in evidence so

535
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,440
um

536
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,880
i think that solves the problem we can

537
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,640
write that into the text very explicitly

538
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,880
whether the profiling

539
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
would allow that

540
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,039
in

541
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,449
[Music]

542
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,200
thank you very much

543
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,879
[Music]

544
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
did you

545
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,679
right now there's two entries in the

546
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,720
meeting materials and you want to make

547
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,080
sure you pick one of these

548
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,279
michael uploaded them yesterday

549
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,880
it's just that the v21 have more

550
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,720
information on it that we need it's the

551
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,799
actual words to

552
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,400
talk about so

553
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,840
all right so uh

554
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,279
let's see i guess since i'm speaking i'm

555
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,480
allowed to take the mask off right

556
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,520
okay now i can breathe

557
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,840
uh all right so i'm talking about the

558
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,320
rats architecture document while we're

559
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,440
getting it up i'll just talk to the

560
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,159
title slide which i'm delaying here

561
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,440
whenever there's actually issues to

562
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,840
discuss we had uh tuesday morning

563
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,039
meetings

564
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,279
and we had a long list of people that

565
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,880
showed up at various types of meetings

566
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,720
and stuff some of them are in the room

567
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,640
some of them are remote

568
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,240
a couple of them are co-authors but i

569
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,000
think we probably had

570
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,919
like 15 people

571
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,279
not necessarily on the same meeting but

572
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,640
collectively discussing the various

573
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,760
issues

574
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,039
that were specific to this document

575
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,200
uh so we had issues and put requests

576
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
that have changed okay here we go yeah

577
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,279
that's the stuff i was just talking

578
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,799
about you can see all the list of names

579
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,840
on the left

580
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,200
so we believe the design team

581
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,559
being people that show up at the

582
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,480
meetings to talk about the specific

583
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,120
issues right is on the left there

584
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,720
um that is of course not working group

585
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,400
consensus that's confirmed on the list

586
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,600
but this is the set of people that were

587
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,360
involved in presenting what's the dot

588
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
what was in the coming up with the text

589
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,240
that's in there right now

590
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,679
um all right so you can go to the next

591
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,400
slide

592
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,000
um this has already gone through ad

593
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,760
review it's gone through one or two

594
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
rounds with uh roman

595
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
um among other things here are the

596
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,159
things that have changed since 113

597
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,000
most of them are editorial things that

598
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,279
including you know some actual wording

599
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,559
suggestions from roman which we thought

600
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,520
were great

601
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,159
um the the uh

602
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,720
non-text version now has the nice svg

603
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
diagrams right so you have some pretty

604
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,159
printed diagrams

605
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,440
uh which you'll actually see two of

606
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
those on the slides um we made some

607
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,200
minor adjustments to the terminology in

608
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
terms of the definitions of things to be

609
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,840
more clear an example uh we changed

610
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,919
integrity protection which was also a

611
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,840
section of heading to the term

612
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,600
conceptual message protection because

613
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,159
it's not just about integrity those are

614
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,320
examples of things right all those are

615
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,159
minor editorial there's no technical

616
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,440
differences there really other than

617
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,679
maybe some clarifications to to say what

618
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,200
we meant about those technical things so

619
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,039
go on to the next slide okay so there's

620
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,039
only one remaining issue in the 80

621
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
review before things going on gone okay

622
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,799
and this is split between two slides

623
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,080
because it's in discussion on two

624
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,919
different diagrams and this is a long

625
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,840
ways away from this mic so

626
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,360
i need to be able to see one of these

627
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,200
slides so i can uh point to stuff

628
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,720
because there's some small print in the

629
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,159
diagram's there that people remote can

630
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,520
see but not local

631
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,360
yeah i think i can see that okay

632
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,279
yeah that's probably out there all right

633
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,600
so the uh little

634
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,240
speech bubble there is uh michael is

635
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,919
kind of how we think about things but

636
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,000
everything else on the slide that's up

637
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,399
above in italics and the diagram is

638
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,200
literal in the document okay and so uh

639
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,799
and i know roman is here right and so

640
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,000
i'm going to kind of summarize this and

641
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,200
roman can correct me because i'm trying

642
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,799
to channel what roman said and then kind

643
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,559
of our discussion about it right so the

644
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,720
diagram there we see this is the uh

645
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
passport model diagram

646
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,360
and it shows an attestation result line

647
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,880
coming down to an attester and then an

648
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,279
attestation line going to the right over

649
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,320
to the line party okay and roman looked

650
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,760
at that and said well that looks like

651
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,919
the attester

652
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,600
does something with those attestation

653
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,120
results for some definition does

654
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,679
something right and wanted to have more

655
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,440
discussion about that and so the text in

656
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,120
italics is actually what the document

657
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,080
says

658
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,480
about that diagram okay so it says

659
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,399
the tester does not consume the

660
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,320
attestation result but might cache it

661
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,080
okay in other words there might be a

662
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,600
time delay between the line coming down

663
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,720
the line going to the right where it's

664
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,399
just an opaque blob that's cached in

665
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,159
storage and then sent off in

666
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,480
uh at an appropriate time uh the

667
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,760
attester can then present the

668
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,520
attestation result and possibly

669
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,200
additional claims if that's encapsulated

670
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,600
in some larger message right

671
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,360
to a relying party

672
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,640
but of course those additional claims

673
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
are not in the attestation result the

674
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,159
attestation result is signed can't be

675
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,159
modified it's an opaque blob to the to

676
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,159
the attester right it can which then

677
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,840
compares its information against its own

678
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,440
appraisal policy

679
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,600
the attester may also present the same

680
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,120
attestation result to other aligned

681
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,720
parties right so it's an opaque blob

682
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,919
he's got this ticket that he can kind of

683
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,840
present just like a human hexa has a

684
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,760
passport you can't modify your passport

685
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,960
but you can go to one airport you can

686
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,240
present it you can then go to the next

687
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,919
airport you can present it and so on

688
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,840
okay so that's as this picture is trying

689
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,720
to describe okay that is uh cash there

690
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,320
as an opaque blob and then you can show

691
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,240
it when you try to get entry into uh

692
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,840
various drawing parties

693
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,919
okay so that was the intent of this text

694
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:00,799
okay

695
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,919
um

696
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,799
and what and so that's why the line

697
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,080
isn't just a pass through it actually

698
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,679
stops there because it can be cached can

699
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,159
be modified that it can be cached and it

700
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,919
can be then be represented to different

701
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,320
relying parties over time as this opaque

702
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,240
blob okay that's what we're trying to

703
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
accomplish with this diagram and with

704
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,360
this text okay

705
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,240
so the question is um whether roman

706
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,760
whether you think or anybody else in the

707
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,440
working group thinks that additional

708
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,080
text changes are necessary to convey

709
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,320
that concept okay as we're trying to

710
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,919
explain why that line terminates there

711
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,279
with that text right there this is what

712
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,399
what the current document says

713
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,640
yeah yeah please go to the mic because

714
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,080
our goal is that by the end of this

715
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,440
meeting we want to be done with this

716
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,799
document right so this is that's why i

717
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,840
said i was going to take at least five

718
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,600
minutes so because this slide and the

719
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,039
wording on the next diagram is really

720
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,360
the only thing to talk about

721
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,520
yeah hi uh roman junior we're talking

722
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,159
about my comments uh i i get that

723
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,080
there's multiple semantics that we're

724
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,919
talking about here my read of section

725
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,240
four is that you that that text is

726
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,159
primarily the statutory definition of

727
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,240
the information flow i think perhaps a

728
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,440
happy compromise of the text in section

729
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,600
5 in section 4 is

730
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,360
not to change the text in section 5

731
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,559
which is talking about the caching

732
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,159
behavior and the rest of it perhaps some

733
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,480
text at the end of section 4 is to

734
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,080
explicitly say this is about documenting

735
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,399
the the the

736
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,000
whatever producer and kind of consumer

737
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,080
behavior that does not it is that's not

738
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,320
intended to constrain the fact that i

739
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,480
guess arbitrary rats elements can share

740
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,320
stuff as long as they're not consumer

741
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,000
considered production producers or

742
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,120
consumers

743
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,640
so if i understand right you're saying

744
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,080
you have no problems with this section

745
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,440
but there's a section that comes before

746
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,360
this which i have on the screen right

747
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,440
section four or whatever that you saying

748
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,720
that one could be more clear would

749
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,559
adding a forward reference to say see

750
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,279
section 5 for more details of what the

751
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,840
how of how it's used or

752
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,519
well i maybe guess the first thing i

753
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,039
guess i'm checking is my understanding

754
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,519
correct that arbitrary rat's elements

755
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,679
can pass the thing as long as they're

756
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,360
not considered the producers of their

757
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,799
consumers because that's my read of what

758
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,600
that architecture is in a sense yes in

759
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,679
the same sense as a router right so just

760
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,039
like routers pass packets without

761
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,640
knowing what the payload is so yes and

762
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,840
that's because

763
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,320
um i mean that the reason i say yes

764
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,600
that's talked about in the document

765
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,360
where it says all the roles and the

766
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,200
conveyance mechanisms are conceptual

767
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,559
right you could have one of the other

768
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,000
roles that send the intermediary in any

769
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,960
of the lines here when you're actually

770
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,039
designing a protocol right you can have

771
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,320
some other role that is actually

772
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,240
intermediary in between these lines here

773
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,200
well that doesn't affect the

774
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,399
architecture that's just a protocol

775
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,080
instantiation it says oh yeah it kind of

776
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,320
bounces off this one as a router kind of

777
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,120
thing

778
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,399
and so it doesn't preclude that it

779
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,840
actually allows that elsewhere so that's

780
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,279
why yes to your answer because it's

781
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,320
consistent with other statements in the

782
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,880
document that say that

783
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,159
the conception of the message goes

784
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,760
between these and here the tester is

785
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,519
involved only in the conceptual diagrams

786
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,200
because he's actually allowed to cache

787
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,279
it and have multiple different line

788
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,799
parties go out the right and so that's

789
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,000
not showing the diagram because it will

790
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,519
complicate it and that's what that text

791
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,200
is that's uh that's the bullet right

792
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,960
above the diagram that says yeah there

793
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,399
could be actually multiple lines to the

794
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,919
right for different relying parties at

795
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,279
different times

796
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,120
okay so let me try it again so i was

797
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,279
operating under the depression that the

798
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,120
the architecture elements of rats were

799
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,600
defined by what they produce and consume

800
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,679
so you can say what do you produce and

801
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,360
consume and like then you understand

802
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,440
what the what the thing is what i'm

803
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,360
hearing is that there are additional

804
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,880
communication

805
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,360
semantics or behaviors of those boxes

806
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,600
that do not necessarily con that they

807
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,919
can be done by kind of everyone

808
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,120
uh in a sense yes okay

809
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,880
yeah so i guess perhaps but but you're

810
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,039
right about the fact that uh the the def

811
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,320
when you said about the definition part

812
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
yeah that is absolutely correct it says

813
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,559
you would not call it evidence if it's

814
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,559
actually consumed by something other

815
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,840
than the verifier right if it was

816
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,760
actually consumed and parsed by

817
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,679
uh a relying party or whatever it would

818
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:48,880
never be called evidence and so in that

819
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,640
sense yes you're exactly right in saying

820
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,080
that the producing and consuming is part

821
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,919
of the definition yeah

822
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,440
yeah so again i'll go back to what i

823
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,919
said i think the the fix for this is

824
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,279
leave five as five is and then four i

825
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,720
think i would i would benefit from

826
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,159
additional language that says something

827
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,559
the effect of you know consume or

828
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,320
produce actually means this there's

829
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,679
there's this definition and that's what

830
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,159
we mean by that and then there are other

831
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,599
ways in which they can be passed which

832
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,040
is not produce and consume and that's in

833
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
scope for all all the elements no

834
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,960
attempt to constrain and see section

835
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,199
five for specific ways in which you know

836
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,879
some of that might occur okay that would

837
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,719
work for me okay

838
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,119
um yeah this is hank and i think roman

839
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,399
just said it

840
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,280
okay

841
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,719
i agree

842
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,520
okay

843
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,599
i don't know if a note taker probably

844
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,719
couldn't have captured that fast enough

845
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,599
we'll probably have to go back to the

846
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,119
recording to see if we can capture some

847
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,760
of that that wording or whatever okay um

848
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,280
so next slide

849
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,800
now we're on the second diagram

850
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,918
basically the same kind of comments in

851
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,599
the second diagram so here's the this is

852
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,040
the diagram for the background check

853
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
model okay and ooh look you notice the

854
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,480
pretty printed version of the of the

855
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
diagrams here okay

856
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,918
so here

857
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,079
um you have the attester and you see the

858
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,760
the evidence line goes over to their

859
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,280
lying party and there's a little curvy

860
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,040
thing that goes through it and then goes

861
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,359
up to the verifier okay so this one is

862
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,480
drawn a little bit differently and

863
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,839
that's because the text below it have a

864
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,040
little bit of different considerations

865
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,119
it's not because it's not the case the

866
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,320
relying party takes that and then

867
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,839
presents it to different verifiers right

868
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,359
so that concept just doesn't occur here

869
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,800
so the the lines are a little bit

870
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
different because the the the way things

871
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,880
are maybe you know cached or whatever a

872
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,839
little bit different so here's what the

873
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:20,880
text says

874
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,640
and this model and a tester conveys

875
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,480
evidence to relying party which treats

876
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,359
it as opaque and simply forwards it onto

877
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,960
a verifier so in the sense it really is

878
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,880
more like a router right it doesn't do

879
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,320
anything with it it doesn't even say

880
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,680
anything about caching right the

881
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
verifier compares the evidence against

882
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,800
its appraisal policy and returns an

883
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,880
attestation result to the allowing party

884
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,320
the relying party then compares the

885
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,680
attestation result against its own

886
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,000
appraisal policy and the resource access

887
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,359
protocol that's the horizontal line

888
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,440
there between the attest unlying party

889
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,280
includes evidence rather than an

890
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,520
attestation result that evidence is not

891
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
processed by the relying party right so

892
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,040
the main part is the first sentence and

893
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,880
the end of the last one okay so here it

894
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,800
really is just a just a pass through

895
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,480
okay and so it terminates at the

896
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,240
transport layer but so the end-to-end

897
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,520
connection just goes all the way through

898
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,800
it and so that's why it kind of curves

899
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,640
straight through there uh because it's

900
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,800
more like um in the routing sense it's

901
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,560
like a layer two termination wherever

902
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,760
three just forwards right that'd be the

903
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,160
analogy here

904
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,079
yeah roman did you i guess same comment

905
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,839
just to be very kind of explicit i think

906
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,400
if you have the the appropriate caveat

907
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,560
weasel words in section four that says

908
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,880
again any rats

909
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,040
rats architectural element it can

910
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,079
opaquely transfer the things that it has

911
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,839
to kind of other rats that would cover

912
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,119
it as well and if you want to talk about

913
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,800
additional semantics inside the box like

914
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
caching the rest of it c section five

915
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,760
yeah i mean it's kind of up to you

916
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,280
whether you define it i mean the key

917
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,119
thing for me was making it really clear

918
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,200
in section four that

919
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,280
that is not the statutory information

920
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,480
flow that's

921
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,920
you're defining by what's produced and

922
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,839
consumed as long as you define those it

923
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,079
works for me thanks okay gotcha so the

924
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,520
summary that i'm hearing is section five

925
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,640
is okay

926
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,119
section four we explain and i'm going to

927
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,960
kind of up level what you said details

928
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,800
are in that that

929
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,079
section four says this is part of the

930
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,520
definitions and the definitions are

931
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,359
based on producing and consuming and

932
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,119
other rat's roles may be involved as

933
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,520
part of the conveyance process for those

934
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
okay

935
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,520
sorry thomas harjona mit uh the um

936
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,440
i i actually posted a comment on the

937
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,119
chat the same question i think the word

938
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,640
convey is too high level that i mean

939
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,960
versus pass through because because

940
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,200
you're saying the word convey and okay

941
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,960
this one in particular uses the word

942
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,560
forward right in the first bullet here

943
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,359
because

944
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,400
we don't use

945
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,880
we use uh

946
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,560
forward when we mean pass through here

947
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,920
and so that one's the most i understand

948
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,599
what this means but just for the new

949
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,560
reader okay so just a quick process

950
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,200
hi thomas for those who are here live if

951
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,119
you can actually put yourselves on the

952
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,200
queue and the media go so the people

953
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,760
do we still state our name at the mic

954
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
given that we have to do that probably

955
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,440
doesn't matter yes we do yeah all right

956
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,359
i think so i think that's it so go ahead

957
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,560
then you can go forward i think that was

958
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,079
the last slide so i think the last one

959
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,359
is just any other question anything else

960
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,040
that we missed because we believe that

961
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,359
if we do this we are done and then it's

962
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,920
past 80 i mean we do this and then roman

963
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,680
pushes it on to the next stage as past

964
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,359
80 review right so because it's already

965
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,640
gone through like multiple working group

966
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,320
last calls and everything so all right

967
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,320
thanks

968
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,960
again yeah on the process finesse it's

969
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,280
an 80 review so when we get the fixes

970
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
here we'll merge it i'll put it into itf

971
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,720
last call okay excellent thank you

972
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,200
so by the way

973
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,359
i'm not tracking the agenda all that

974
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,760
tightly given that we had 50 minutes of

975
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,320
pokemon

976
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
so your your five minutes was actually

977
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,640
12 days but it was productive

978
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
you know the chairs are not following

979
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,040
the time in the agenda it's because

980
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,759
we're making good progress

981
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,000
okay i forget who was next

982
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,960
so the uh the first slide

983
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,280
which we're about to see

984
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,560
uh describes the differences in

985
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,520
eat drafts 13 and 14

986
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,160
since the

987
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,200
last ietf

988
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,400
so really four areas uh some document

989
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,200
reorganization that

990
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,800
i think should help make the document a

991
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,680
little bit easier to digest

992
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,839
the claims section which had like 20

993
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,720
plus claims in it now is divided into

994
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,599
four

995
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,640
so

996
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,280
one section for the nonce

997
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,359
the major section about claims about

998
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,440
about the entity

999
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,839
um then there is a section that are

1000
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,160
claims about the token for example

1001
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,240
profile is about the token not about the

1002
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,400
entity it tells you something about the

1003
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,160
token

1004
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,240
and then there's a section on including

1005
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,839
cryptographic keys in tokens

1006
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,200
a couple of the sections were moved to

1007
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,800
appendices

1008
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,119
so the core of the document now is is

1009
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,720
substantially shorter um these were some

1010
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,480
things about there were really good

1011
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,560
discussions earlier on about designing

1012
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,640
claims and about

1013
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,280
keys and

1014
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,680
[Music]

1015
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,359
endorsement and how that

1016
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,839
sets up so uh they're not really

1017
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,319
critically normative uh

1018
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,079
to reading the documents so they're in

1019
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,680
appendices now but they were good work

1020
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,319
and they didn't want to lose them

1021
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,560
um so that's the document organization

1022
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,440
uh then in terms of actual changes to

1023
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,119
the specification

1024
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,079
um

1025
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,680
uh for uh manifests and uh software

1026
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,960
evidence claims um those are plugable

1027
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,400
meaning you can put a lot of different

1028
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,880
formats in there um

1029
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,400
and uh

1030
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,480
i switched to uh co-app content

1031
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,319
identifiers rather than cbor tags

1032
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,040
because of the json support and other so

1033
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,400
sorry to interrupt your lines the remote

1034
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,000
folks are saying that we're having some

1035
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,400
difficulty seeing those slides

1036
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,079
yeah they're not fizzy they're not the

1037
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,119
meat

1038
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,760
yeah we're still trying to work uh meat

1039
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
echo uh

1040
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,200
is having some issues

1041
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,480
so ned is close

1042
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,839
okay i'm gonna keep going

1043
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,480
uh so that that was the you know the

1044
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,920
switch to uh co-op content types uh that

1045
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,240
seemed like a better solution overall um

1046
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,720
for uh the pluggable

1047
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,200
software evidence and manifests um

1048
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,480
so uh

1049
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,640
we added uh the spddx and cyclone dx

1050
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,560
manifest types

1051
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,040
uh so the ma the manifest claim you know

1052
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,560
it can be

1053
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,920
a a coast width or a suit manifest now

1054
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,040
it can also be an spd-x or a cyclone dx

1055
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,640
this is also pluggable so it can be

1056
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,440
extended by other documents uh

1057
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,440
it's just it's open-ended we can't

1058
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,240
really pick a winner here on on manifest

1059
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,480
type so it's a general plugable thing

1060
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,160
and we have the specification for how to

1061
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,000
do spd-x and cyclone dx

1062
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,800
the measurement results which is

1063
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,319
just describing the results of

1064
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,960
measurements not the results of a

1065
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,599
verification that claim was reworked and

1066
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,359
it works a little better now it's more

1067
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,520
general can can represent measurements

1068
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,960
of things other than just software

1069
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,000
um then uh

1070
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,200
there was there is a uh

1071
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,960
a profile added this is kind of an

1072
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,359
example profile it's also a definition

1073
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,760
of a standard profile uh

1074
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,040
an eat profile specifically for uh eat

1075
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,280
devices eat constrained device eat on

1076
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,040
constrained devices so seabor

1077
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,400
i think that's the profile that most

1078
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,560
people are really looking at using

1079
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,640
for this so that that actually

1080
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,319
says things like use cbor uh

1081
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,440
uh

1082
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,040
no indefinite length encoding um use uh

1083
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,640
es 256 384 or 512 for the algorithm and

1084
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,720
some things like that so that

1085
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,960
i think that will help the profile

1086
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,839
issue

1087
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,880
a bit

1088
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,160
and give an example profile

1089
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,760
uh

1090
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,800
so that's the specification changes

1091
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,599
the cddl was improved

1092
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,920
you know we had a discussion in

1093
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,359
vienna about

1094
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,680
where to define claim set and dependency

1095
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,599
on uccs that's

1096
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,599
resolved by just putting

1097
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,480
a definition of claim set in an appendix

1098
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,240
in uh eat

1099
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,480
and saying that you know there's other

1100
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,319
definitions of this uh in other

1101
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,839
documents and you know they should all

1102
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,760
stay in sync it's not a controversial

1103
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,240
definition or a difficult one so i don't

1104
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,160
see any issue here i mean that was based

1105
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,000
on carsten's suggestion that it's fine

1106
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,280
to replicate

1107
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,040
cddl

1108
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,000
so

1109
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,640
then all definition of uccs is removed

1110
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,119
but there is a socket

1111
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,599
uh cddl socket into which uh other um

1112
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,640
heat formats can be plugged

1113
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,480
and then there's just a

1114
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,040
a lot of cddl improvements

1115
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,680
it's actually validating jason and

1116
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,400
sibor examples so the so the examples in

1117
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,119
the

1118
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,640
eat spec

1119
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,200
are all validated in the built document

1120
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,960
build process with the cddl tool

1121
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,160
and then there's just lots of wording

1122
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,240
improvements the profile section was the

1123
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,319
biggest one based on comments from uh

1124
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,040
elliot um i i want to note there that

1125
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,880
one of the things i really did

1126
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,520
there was

1127
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,960
make reference to what are almost

1128
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,960
profile sections in sibor and in cose

1129
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,280
i mean there's actually documents uh

1130
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,200
kose documents

1131
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,280
that are profiles i don't remember the

1132
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,400
thing but they actually call them as

1133
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,359
profile

1134
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,240
call themselves a profile document

1135
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,280
uh

1136
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,520
ned

1137
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,720
oh okay i see

1138
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,240
we switched switch screens here

1139
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,839
uh

1140
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,760
let's see now uh

1141
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,040
yeah i can't see my slides now

1142
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,240
and hank is in the queue

1143
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,800
that's a pocket dial

1144
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,119
i was just confused by there being no

1145
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,880
slides i was like maybe i should wait

1146
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,599
and then i forgot so um

1147
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,160
brent and i were quickly exchanging on

1148
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,640
zulip cool zulu by the way

1149
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,680
um

1150
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,560
that

1151
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,880
the phrasing in the eat

1152
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,880
id says

1153
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,800
sw evidence can contain a suit manifest

1154
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,920
but a manifest cannot be evidence

1155
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,800
okay that sounds wrong yeah so uh so

1156
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,240
that's in it i mean

1157
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,000
that's not anything the eat sounds wrong

1158
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,040
not you

1159
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,839
but yes

1160
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,079
i i mean if you get that in the notes or

1161
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,960
file an issue just so i don't forget

1162
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,280
um

1163
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,480
and then there was a bunch of um

1164
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,640
yeah yeah go uh

1165
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,760
i wasn't quite finished with the

1166
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,680
previous slide

1167
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,680
uh but mostly just uh i think i think

1168
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,119
the profile thing was the main thing i

1169
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,119
wanted to mention here the rest of it is

1170
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,200
just uh

1171
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,839
um

1172
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,599
oh the last the last bullet there the

1173
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,000
relationship of evidence to attestation

1174
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
results basically can you know what it

1175
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,079
means to forward

1176
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,920
claims that are in evidence in

1177
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,520
attestation results you take a claim

1178
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,800
that's an evidence goes through the

1179
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,200
verifier and gets sent to the relying

1180
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,440
party and attestation results so

1181
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,359
there's a there's text in there that

1182
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,359
describes what that should mean and

1183
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,800
basically says

1184
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,040
you need to understand the verifiers

1185
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,359
policy to know what's going on there uh

1186
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,960
you can't just i mean it doesn't mean

1187
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,400
that that

1188
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,559
you can automatically trust those or or

1189
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,319
that they automatically mean something

1190
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,480
so

1191
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,400
um and that was again an outcome of

1192
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,920
discussions at um ietf113

1193
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,040
okay next slide

1194
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,720
uh so uh

1195
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,359
this is this is the the work in the eq

1196
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,440
um i think the security considerations

1197
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,520
need some work uh

1198
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,359
comments on that please

1199
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,160
um

1200
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,680
uh

1201
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,640
i have a a fairly large set of comments

1202
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,800
uh on uh the introduction and the

1203
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,640
abstract and some kind of higher level

1204
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,839
things that i haven't processed yet

1205
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,040
these are some of these are from uh

1206
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,280
elliot's review and from other other uh

1207
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,440
comments so i'm working through those um

1208
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,640
then there's a bunch of other little

1209
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,559
inconsistencies that that are working

1210
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,960
through um

1211
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,400
so the uh i think those are all

1212
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,680
straightforward uh i don't see any need

1213
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,160
for big discussion on those um

1214
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,480
then uh there's just two possible minor

1215
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,079
improvements that are kind of uh

1216
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,640
standing open right now um one is about

1217
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,520
the nonce uh right now it says nonces

1218
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,280
are absolutely required

1219
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,079
um but uh there's the time stamp based

1220
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,280
freshness that's in the rats

1221
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,119
architecture and it seems like each

1222
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,839
should accommodate that um it's probably

1223
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,319
not a difficult thing to do

1224
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,559
and that would make nonce optional

1225
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,400
if you're doing the time-based one so

1226
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,160
comment on that if you if you think

1227
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,400
that's a good thing or not or contribute

1228
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,119
a

1229
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,960
pr or not or or something like that

1230
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,800
and then the other one is since we have

1231
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,839
a standard uh profile in

1232
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:06,880
eat

1233
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,200
for seabor we might consider having a

1234
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,160
standard profile for jason

1235
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,160
i think that was another suggestion so i

1236
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,160
haven't made any attempts at writing

1237
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,760
that or or know what that would look

1238
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,040
like but uh that was a suggestion

1239
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,000
so that's it for now

1240
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,480
oh they're just leaving oh no okay no no

1241
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,880
no uh question on endorsements there was

1242
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,520
a lot of discussion on endorsements

1243
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,040
and can they be delivered through a

1244
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,800
tester's unsigned what was the

1245
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,599
disposition of that

1246
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,160
so

1247
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
i mean eat is kind of neutral to

1248
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,799
endorsements

1249
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,280
that was an open discussion

1250
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:05,510
[Music]

1251
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,000
are you talking specifically about

1252
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,839
security levels as an endorsement

1253
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,200
okay

1254
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,359
um i think i've said this before but but

1255
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,119
generally from the semiconductor

1256
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,800
manufacturer perspective in the armed

1257
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,920
ecosystem for uh for

1258
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,880
nowadays not just arm but attestations

1259
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,640
generally don't treat endorsements the

1260
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,040
way the tcg does

1261
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,240
so

1262
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,760
really i want to make sure that we have

1263
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,520
our terminology correct are you using

1264
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,680
endorsements the way the tcg is defining

1265
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,480
it because the way i understand it an

1266
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,240
endorsement of the tcg as defined as tcg

1267
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,079
and ned you actually posted this on the

1268
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,599
uh on the mailing list several months

1269
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:48,400
ago

1270
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,880
is essentially a certificate provided by

1271
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,280
the manufacturer that a relying party

1272
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,720
can use

1273
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,760
in its assessment of an attestation

1274
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,800
and its assessment of the secure the

1275
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,319
security insurance of an attester

1276
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:10,620
[Laughter]

1277
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,680
uh by the terminology i'm not really

1278
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,760
trying to be strict to one or another

1279
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,200
i'm just trying to figure out how do you

1280
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,119
deliver claims

1281
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,520
that really should not be generated by

1282
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,680
in a tester so i'm trying to find the

1283
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,200
logical way

1284
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,559
where things that can come from

1285
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,319
elsewhere are

1286
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,240
meaningfully delivered

1287
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,640
and that's the open question that i i

1288
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,040
didn't understand the closure of

1289
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,160
yeah so i i don't think i would call

1290
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,000
security the security level claim an

1291
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,240
endorsement

1292
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,240
i i haven't been thinking of it as an

1293
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,839
endorsement

1294
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,599
and i think there's

1295
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,119
yeah there were some email threads

1296
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,680
around this that didn't get settled

1297
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,839
um and i guess we should take those up

1298
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,000
again to to kind of really understand

1299
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,319
what endorsement means

1300
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,640
um i mean i i i know i've definitely

1301
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,680
thought something about that but i've

1302
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,680
been focused on other details lately so

1303
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,599
it seems a pretty important question to

1304
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,480
me

1305
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,119
what endorsement means

1306
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,040
okay we need to move the queue and then

1307
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,078
all right just put it in the chat please

1308
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,240
um so yeah um

1309
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,359
gary i i understand from the eat point

1310
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,920
of view um that is true but as arm is a

1311
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,240
co-author of korim and they definitely

1312
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,599
do not treat endorsements like you just

1313
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,319
highlighted i would not give arm as an

1314
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,680
example here

1315
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,839
because i think

1316
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,960
um i'm definitely

1317
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,800
uses what includes at least the

1318
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,480
definition of endorsement from tcg

1319
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,520
another gpm from dice from mars from any

1320
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,960
kind of endorsement it goes with remote

1321
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,280
attestation in the world so um just

1322
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,800
highlighting that

1323
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,440
okay oh also um dave's maybe get that um

1324
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,520
this uh action brunch i actually wanted

1325
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,040
to come here because time-based

1326
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,400
freshness

1327
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,040
there are few interaction models um we

1328
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,040
uh planning on maybe an ayanna regis

1329
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,800
before it's a very fresh idea from

1330
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,079
yesterday

1331
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,319
and that might go into the uh reference

1332
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,160
interaction model so if you're doing

1333
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,240
nonce and time based you might also do

1334
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,000
epoch id and then you would be

1335
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,920
interoperable with this uh ayana

1336
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,680
iterations of how to do things and maybe

1337
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,599
dave has something to say for them

1338
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,640
okay so the chairs will be compiling a

1339
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,520
list of what we see as the open issues

1340
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,680
where we don't see

1341
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,000
uh closure and working group consensus

1342
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,079
so that we can help make chair decisions

1343
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,079
on that to help this document progress

1344
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,200
further

1345
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,760
we may hold an interim meeting soon

1346
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,440
depending on the the length of that it's

1347
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,359
probably likely to be able to help

1348
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,119
process this more quickly

1349
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,839
thank you

1350
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,880
i think hank's comment we can cover in

1351
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,800
the open like later because

1352
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,920
there may be another minute on that

1353
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,880
where i want to comment on that but i'm

1354
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,960
not going to do that now

1355
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,800
i got up here to say that uh i think the

1356
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,720
eat document other than the work in the

1357
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,880
queue or whatever um i think the

1358
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,720
document is okay with respect to their

1359
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,000
questions that have come up meaning i

1360
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,280
think there are things that not

1361
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,880
necessarily even endorsements right

1362
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,720
whether you can do endorsements in the

1363
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,000
eat format or not you don't have to

1364
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,920
change the original for each document if

1365
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,720
you were to say i'm going to do an

1366
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,240
endorsement in any format you can do

1367
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,160
that um so in other words i don't think

1368
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,160
that that is something that will in my

1369
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,160
opinion any results any changes here

1370
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,680
that's not why i got why i put in my

1371
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,359
name in the cube i put my aim in the key

1372
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,400
was to make the same point on a

1373
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,079
different topic

1374
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,480
one of the things that came up at the

1375
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,760
hackathon

1376
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,760
is something that lawrence and i talked

1377
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,440
about and we believe that the document

1378
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,880
is fine and just want to report that out

1379
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,000
to the rest of the document this had to

1380
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,920
do with the manifests

1381
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,359
when er lawrence talked about this he

1382
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,119
said it was a socket okay

1383
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,559
at the table we came up with a request

1384
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,799
to have a different type of format in

1385
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,640
the manifest where the manifest right

1386
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,799
now says it's the entire manifest not a

1387
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,440
reference to one and we said okay gosh

1388
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,480
it sure would be nice if you could have

1389
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,799
a reference to a manifest okay but we

1390
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,319
said this is a socket which means you

1391
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,480
can do that in an extension document

1392
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,559
which does not hold up the eat spec

1393
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,920
so i just want to report out that i

1394
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,079
think the eat spec is perfectly fine and

1395
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,680
we can do that in an extension so just

1396
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,960
wanted to report the discussion lawrence

1397
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,000
and i were having the rest of working

1398
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,480
group thanks

1399
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,240
thank you

1400
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,359
okay

1401
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,720
thomas

1402
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,760
hi

1403
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,200
can you hear me

1404
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,119
yes you can

1405
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,040
awesome

1406
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,839
okay eat media types

1407
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:32,640
um next please

1408
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,760
right okay i will okay so this is a

1409
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,680
document that lauren sank and i have put

1410
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,799
together

1411
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,319
to register a bunch of media attacks

1412
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,640
that are applicable to hit payloads

1413
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,640
and this is in a separate document from

1414
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,559
the spec because at the time we

1415
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,400
discussed the topic on the mailing list

1416
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,559
a few months ago now

1417
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,280
the fear was this would cause cope creep

1418
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,520
and delay it and

1419
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,920
and so we packed the definitions and the

1420
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,640
registration into this separate dock

1421
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,839
that has normative dependencies on both

1422
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,160
it and uccs

1423
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,040
without bloating those two

1424
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,599
and the main use case is uh

1425
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,599
for for for media types is you know

1426
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,359
usually so you need to carry some rats

1427
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,839
conceptual messages say your evidence or

1428
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,920
your attestation results using

1429
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,040
um some type agnostic rest api that is

1430
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,960
laid say on top of http or co-op and

1431
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,720
and you want your your clients and

1432
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,839
servers

1433
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,960
um endpoints uh to be able to correctly

1434
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,000
tag their payloads um and do do content

1435
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,480
negotiation and and what not and and you

1436
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,319
also want your brokers

1437
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,799
uh say your load balancers your api

1438
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,040
routers to do their job

1439
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,319
um

1440
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,559
uh without without having to snoop into

1441
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,920
uh l7 too much um you know and all this

1442
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,240
usual fun stuff

1443
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,480
and as you can see from the picture

1444
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,440
um it has a quite rich type system and

1445
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,040
uh basically this document um creates a

1446
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,480
new media type for each of the

1447
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,520
productions in the grammar

1448
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,200
so you have the naked

1449
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,760
naked claim claim set

1450
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,559
claim sets in a web token and the touch

1451
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,040
bundle these are the three main things

1452
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,559
and you have two

1453
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,640
times two those because each of them

1454
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,160
allows for either a sibor or or a json

1455
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,319
realization so we have six new media

1456
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:29,839
types in total

1457
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,880
uh

1458
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,160
next please

1459
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,520
next please because

1460
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,839
and i have a table yeah exactly with all

1461
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,359
the types and and the name so we have

1462
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,839
cot and jot so we have the two debs

1463
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,119
um and the two target claim sets

1464
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,720
all under uh the standards three

1465
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,559
with a type application and a nice

1466
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,799
subtype that starts with uh eat dash

1467
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,640
and all but

1468
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,480
all but the web tokens also have the

1469
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,280
plus json plus super suffix

1470
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,520
and cotton jots don't because jot is not

1471
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,559
plus json and we wanted symmetry

1472
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,160
um

1473
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,520
yeah

1474
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,079
next please

1475
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,599
right and and on top of that we also

1476
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,240
define a media type parameter

1477
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,760
uh for the um profile this is completely

1478
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,880
optional

1479
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,280
so certain apis may entirely disregard

1480
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,799
this existence

1481
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,240
and some other

1482
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,040
may instead want to

1483
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,200
to use make use of it for example as i

1484
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,839
said before um it can be used to pass

1485
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,319
the content um of the heat profile claim

1486
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,319
to the upper layer processors while

1487
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,240
while in transit right so to help the

1488
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,480
api routing infrastructure and more

1489
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,920
generally it it it gives you a scalable

1490
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,640
type system that

1491
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,559
fully mirrors the extensibility of it

1492
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,280
and i've added a few examples in the

1493
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,119
next few slides but we can skip over

1494
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,440
them they are basically example about

1495
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,520
content negotiation

1496
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,559
so

1497
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,280
um next please yeah here is a successful

1498
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,880
negotiation where the client is

1499
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,079
submitting some evidence for

1500
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,599
verification

1501
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,040
and yeah everything goes okay so um the

1502
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,559
the content type of the

1503
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,319
of the of the evidence is okay the um

1504
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,000
attestation results format are

1505
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,559
acceptable and therefore everything

1506
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,119
is finalized with with the 200 okay

1507
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,760
in another example that

1508
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,000
is in the next slide

1509
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,880
uh again we're

1510
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,799
yeah here we have a the same client

1511
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,400
submitting evidence for verification but

1512
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,319
this time the content content

1513
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:41,599
negotiation goes wrong so you have 415

1514
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,359
support and media type report from the

1515
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:46,480
server side because the

1516
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,720
con the evidence is not in a supported

1517
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,599
format and the server is able to

1518
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,440
tell the client

1519
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,359
which which

1520
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,680
media types are acceptable for for the

1521
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,720
service

1522
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,480
and then a second example of failed

1523
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,319
negotiation in a in a

1524
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,559
in the slide that follows this one

1525
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,920
please ned if you could scroll

1526
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,559
yeah this one uh if

1527
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,640
the thing ends up in a 406 not

1528
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,559
acceptable because

1529
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:17,040
the um

1530
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,760
the client is requesting uh the format

1531
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,359
of the decision results to be of a

1532
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,520
certain profile and of a certain media

1533
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,190
type and that is not um

1534
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,799
[Music]

1535
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,880
compatible with the server side which

1536
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,920
can then reply and say

1537
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,040
can do that sorry i can only do this and

1538
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,440
and and and and fill the the accept

1539
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,960
header

1540
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,599
so it's it's really that simple um and

1541
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,240
so next slide please is i think is the

1542
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,599
ad option

1543
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,960
yeah yeah so

1544
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,839
uh

1545
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,760
the question is whether we the working

1546
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,640
group

1547
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,860
wants to adopt this thing or not um

1548
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,240
[Music]

1549
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,920
yeah so the question is for you for the

1550
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,160
floor

1551
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,720
so the question is has anybody reviewed

1552
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,359
the document

1553
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,839
or not authors

1554
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,880
so we'd like to have a couple reviews

1555
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,240
and then um we can solicit feedback on

1556
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,319
readiness for adoption on the mail list

1557
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,520
i have no objection to adoption i think

1558
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,839
it should be adopted um this

1559
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,920
thomas this is a question for you so

1560
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,960
we've uh

1561
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,559
at least in phyto alliance we've done

1562
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,280
interops with the existing media types

1563
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,799
using each and its cw in its cot form

1564
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,520
and i've recommended that

1565
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,599
i recommend it to the working group

1566
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,680
there that we stick to existing media

1567
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,480
types in the case that there are um

1568
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,280
uh

1569
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,119
content filtering middle boxes um

1570
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,520
now are you planning to put any

1571
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,520
recommendations in this document as to

1572
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,680
when these media types should be used in

1573
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,240
place of the existing cod jot and seabor

1574
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,760
media types

1575
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,559
that was not my intention

1576
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,839
i think they are

1577
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,280
just

1578
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,319
you know we we just uh create these

1579
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,400
entries in the in the registry so if if

1580
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,799
your api wants to use it then

1581
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:29,440
use it otherwise use whatever you think

1582
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,839
is better

1583
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,640
okay but i think if there's some

1584
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,960
existing implementations

1585
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,480
that

1586
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,559
if there's some existing implementations

1587
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,359
that uh that um

1588
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,359
maybe don't recognize these media types

1589
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:48,240
and uh

1590
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,440
and and a tester is producing then then

1591
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,119
that may fail

1592
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,559
so i think there may be some

1593
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,799
interoperability issues from that from

1594
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,200
that perspective uh i don't know gary

1595
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,000
because you know if you're using an api

1596
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,760
you have to stick with the rules of that

1597
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,000
api you have to know uh what the you

1598
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,960
know your urls are what the media types

1599
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,200
are what uh what kind of you know

1600
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,280
interaction model you're you're supposed

1601
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,240
to to use when when talking to that

1602
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,839
server endpoint

1603
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,839
so i'm not i'm not sure it's it's the

1604
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,480
case that someone uh and a tester can

1605
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,440
just create um

1606
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,440
evidence wrap it in the media type and

1607
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,079
send it over to a a url uh and

1608
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,000
okay and the other reason that this will

1609
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,440
work you know

1610
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,920
yeah now understood thanks the other

1611
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,920
reason uh the other reason i recommended

1612
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,000
against it um though i didn't put this

1613
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,680
in writing was that there are content

1614
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,680
filtering mailboxes

1615
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,599
and particularly the dangerous ones that

1616
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,400
actually can intercept tls connections

1617
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,680
they may

1618
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,559
it might actually be better to disguise

1619
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,640
attestations in a more general media

1620
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,440
type

1621
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,440
have you thought about that so for

1622
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,280
instance if the media type is actually

1623
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,960
available to the middle box they may say

1624
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,440
oh this is an attestation media type and

1625
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,200
if it's uh

1626
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,960
and if it's um

1627
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,839
engaging in some money it is some under

1628
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,920
undesired unexpected behavior they may

1629
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,680
actually drop it even though the

1630
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,280
attestation might be very important to

1631
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,240
the media

1632
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,359
to the uh

1633
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,680
to the communication session

1634
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,119
that's an interesting consideration and

1635
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,039
i haven't thought about that but i think

1636
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,119
this will you know become apparent when

1637
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:30,160
we use it you know i we cannot say that

1638
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,240
it's gonna happen uh

1639
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,880
up front we we need experience

1640
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,960
and if we say that you know in some

1641
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,280
specific

1642
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,599
environments or deployments that is is

1643
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,680
the case then you know

1644
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,480
given

1645
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,559
based on the experience we can we can we

1646
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,640
can write something up and

1647
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,280
and amend this but uh for the time being

1648
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,920
i i'm not sure there's

1649
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,760
this there's sufficient evidence to to

1650
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,020
to actually um

1651
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,160
[Music]

1652
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,319
write this thing up in in the way that

1653
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,960
you put forward okay

1654
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,400
we can consider it for maybe later in

1655
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,680
this in the security council

1656
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,880
all right thank you very much cheers

1657
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,119
okay

1658
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,880
uh the teep working group um

1659
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,520
the t protocol now has a dependency on

1660
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,880
this document

1661
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,480
uh and that's because it defines a neat

1662
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,440
profile

1663
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,319
and it has to have a way of

1664
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,240
communicating that in you know content

1665
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,160
type and accept headers

1666
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,760
and so uh if uh this could be um

1667
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,240
expedited so that this could uh actually

1668
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,480
get to rfc before the t protocol right

1669
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,760
the t protocol i would say is not

1670
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,000
imminent it's stable but not imminent

1671
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,880
right then that would be ideal um if for

1672
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,720
some reason this was going to not be

1673
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,319
adopted or take a very long time we'd

1674
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,000
have to find some alternate approach in

1675
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,359
teep which would cause problems so

1676
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,680
that's why adopting this sooner or later

1677
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,160
is preferred from teep thank you

1678
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,359
okay so

1679
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,520
we need to confirm do a call for

1680
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,680
adoption on the mail list

1681
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,799
so

1682
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:03,119
you know we'll need several people not

1683
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,720
just one

1684
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,559
click support

1685
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:07,599
we need more

1686
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,960
we need more reviewers as well

1687
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,000
so there's a thing and other true

1688
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,640
stories but um um the working group

1689
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,319
called adoption is calling for review

1690
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,420
right so

1691
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,640
[Music]

1692
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,799
they're coincidental

1693
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,400
okay

1694
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,520
okay

1695
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,480
um

1696
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,839
okay this is quorum um

1697
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,079
right uh and we're back with it um can

1698
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:38,720
you

1699
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,000
can give me

1700
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,359
the next slide please

1701
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,599
thank you okay it's just this is just a

1702
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,760
refresher aquarium is concerned with uh

1703
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,680
providing this info and data model for

1704
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,760
describing the kinds of rats conceptual

1705
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,400
messages that um are known as

1706
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,559
endorsements and ref values

1707
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:58,480
so this is the junction between

1708
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,400
testation verifiers and the supply chain

1709
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,400
that creates the

1710
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,599
attester whose evidence these verifiers

1711
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,280
are supposed to verify

1712
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,160
right so if you look at the the yellow

1713
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,640
object there that's what column does and

1714
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,720
the and the red arrows the rest is

1715
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,080
completely out of scope of chrome in

1716
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,000
particular appraisal policies are not

1717
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,960
are not in scope

1718
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:24,479
so next please

1719
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,279
okay so we we we presented karim a

1720
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,560
couple of times

1721
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,600
previously and and we asked for adoption

1722
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,359
and the working group response was was

1723
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,920
pretty positive but for unfortunately

1724
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,920
ref values and endorsement we're not in

1725
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,560
scope of charter zero one

1726
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,399
and so we had to update the chartered

1727
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:44,880
for for expanding scope enough that

1728
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,759
supply chain provisioning was covered

1729
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:48,319
um

1730
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:49,920
[Music]

1731
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,158
next please

1732
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,238
so the good news is that now we have a

1733
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,158
main deliverable two standardized

1734
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:57,759
interoperable data formats to declare

1735
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,158
and convey endorsements and ref values

1736
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:03,120
and a related milestone too and thanks

1737
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,880
to everybody for the discussion and for

1738
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,080
the big part push for to get the update

1739
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,839
over the line thanks particularly to

1740
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,560
roman for being instrumental in this

1741
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,679
work

1742
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,799
uh so next please

1743
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,399
because in the meantime we have

1744
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,719
published zero three uh and that was a

1745
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:21,920
major

1746
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,319
revamp and and there was

1747
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,479
it was you know there was internal

1748
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,120
triggers but also that the cars

1749
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,080
uh was review was uh was uh very

1750
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,799
important for us to push us in in this

1751
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:35,920
direction

1752
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,719
um we also have open source tooling that

1753
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,640
is available to anyone who has to play

1754
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,399
with it um

1755
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,920
and it is of course a work in progress

1756
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,719
because the the the the format is a work

1757
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,920
in progress but we are starting to see

1758
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,719
uh

1759
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,880
protocol extensions based on quorum and

1760
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,000
and um and carl's tas uh

1761
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,640
which i think he's going to present next

1762
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,640
is the is the major example of that and

1763
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,400
we also have application profiles built

1764
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,920
on top of quorum like the psa

1765
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,360
endorsement spec

1766
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,280
and i think maybe ned can confirm that

1767
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,719
intel is also working on something

1768
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,719
similar

1769
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:11,440
so

1770
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,719
yeah obviously the authors would

1771
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,600
want to ask again for for adoption

1772
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,920
and um you know

1773
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,960
now that we are clear to go

1774
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,520
basically we are no impediment from from

1775
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,320
the former point of view

1776
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,800
um

1777
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,600
so

1778
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,440
i haven't reviewed this document before

1779
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,920
or since ief 113 but i reviewed it when

1780
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,880
hank and i talked about it before 113.

1781
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,800
and i think i made this comment i think

1782
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,760
then and

1783
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,000
that i'm being consistent

1784
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,920
that uh i support adoption for the

1785
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,840
purpose of reference values

1786
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,920
um this was previously not allowed by

1787
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,600
our charter or whatever and now it is i

1788
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,480
think

1789
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,960
and so in that sense i support adoption

1790
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,920
um

1791
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,760
i am a little bit skeptical given that i

1792
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,800
haven't read it that it's actually

1793
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,440
appropriate for use for endorsements

1794
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,360
okay where i think something that is

1795
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,640
eat-based is probably better for

1796
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,840
endorsements but i don't think that

1797
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,520
should affect its call for adoption okay

1798
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,600
but that's my constraint on the scope

1799
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,800
the reason that i have a difference

1800
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,880
there is that reference values

1801
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,320
the reference value provider is

1802
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,920
typically providing a set of reference

1803
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,600
values like the following claim values

1804
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,360
could be any of these

1805
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,199
whereas in an eat it's typically a

1806
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,120
single 10 that says the attester here is

1807
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,159
the value

1808
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,679
and for an endorsement i usually think

1809
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,600
of that as a singleton that says this

1810
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,040
device over there that i manufactured it

1811
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,560
has this single value

1812
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,239
and so for that i think an e-format is

1813
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,600
probably more appropriate but i have not

1814
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,960
reviewed the document to verify that

1815
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,400
right now so i just want to say i

1816
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,000
support adoption for use for reference

1817
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,520
value providers

1818
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,040
not necessarily regardless of whether

1819
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,320
it's used for endorsements i support it

1820
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,520
for reference value providers but

1821
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,880
endorsements is still a question of my

1822
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,120
mind

1823
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,839
thank you

1824
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,840
so uh hey this is not relating the the

1825
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,640
comment just highlighting that um

1826
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,719
we had a review from

1827
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,880
microsoft azure internal people using

1828
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,880
dice and they were like yay

1829
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,560
so i i think that's

1830
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,960
a good sign so it would be good if they

1831
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,120
could provide that feedback and comment

1832
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,400
for support on the mail list right

1833
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,120
so that's another one that we need more

1834
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,800
reviewers so

1835
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,560
you know as cheers we look for at least

1836
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,239
three reviewers

1837
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,320
to provide feedback comment you know the

1838
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,480
usual questions of you know willing to

1839
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,920
review

1840
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,840
interoperability implementation and so

1841
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,960
on so we can do

1842
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,799
thank you

1843
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:44,480
oh you were fast thomas

1844
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,480
the reason why i was starting to run the

1845
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,080
clock is i thought you were gonna take

1846
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,559
10 minutes

1847
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,640
we'll talk about the concise ta store

1848
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,520
spec next

1849
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,199
if you haven't read it which i'm

1850
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,880
guessing is probably most

1851
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,080
link is here

1852
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,199
um

1853
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,719
editors copies and that github repo

1854
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:19,679
and i did fork the the quorum guys work

1855
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,640
which was really good work to implement

1856
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,080
this so that's available in my repo

1857
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,679
depending on how the strap goes we'll

1858
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:29,280
see if i send a pr

1859
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,520
for considering to merge

1860
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,760
next

1861
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,000
oh actually one thing on that um

1862
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,080
it does include a command line tool

1863
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,320
where you can create structures from the

1864
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,120
specs so with the json template use that

1865
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,960
tool and you can play with it to a

1866
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,480
pretty good degree

1867
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,920
next slide

1868
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,600
what we're asking for is except this is

1869
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,280
a working group draft and proceed on

1870
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,559
standards track next

1871
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,600
um

1872
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,400
you know why did we do this

1873
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,800
russ and i have a mutual

1874
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,800
customer who's wanting to extend the ca

1875
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,600
to to consider more stuff at

1876
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,760
verification time

1877
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,440
and that stuff includes

1878
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,120
attestations

1879
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,440
there'll be a draft presented at lamps

1880
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,360
wednesday morning on kiata stations

1881
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,559
adding those to um

1882
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,480
to a few different cert request

1883
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,840
protocols

1884
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,440
when you step back and look at this

1885
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,120
we're really implementing a verifier and

1886
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,120
the inputs the verifiers are mini and

1887
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,520
varied and the trust anchors are often

1888
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,719
though fairly tightly used and putting

1889
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:36,640
them all in a great big pile and giving

1890
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,239
them lots of scope is kind of sad

1891
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,280
so we defined this to represent trust

1892
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,960
anchors with some limitations on the

1893
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,360
context

1894
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,159
so next slide

1895
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,120
so when we started out thinking about

1896
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,239
this we look first at the um phyto

1897
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:59,280
metadata syntax

1898
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,159
since they do key attestations

1899
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:04,159
if you look at that structure it's a

1900
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:07,199
dictionary with attestation roots

1901
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:11,600
under keys that are authenticator ids

1902
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,040
which they don't call that out as a

1903
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,880
constraint but it kind of functions as a

1904
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,560
constraint

1905
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,719
we saw the presentation of quorum at the

1906
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:21,520
last ietf thought there was a decent bit

1907
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,040
of overlap

1908
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,440
we set out to write this as a profile of

1909
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,280
korean

1910
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,520
but hit some issues that

1911
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,880
led us to do it as an extension

1912
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,040
so some of those issues are listed here

1913
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,520
the life cycle of tas and reference data

1914
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,360
is not necessarily the same

1915
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,920
the use cases for for trust tankers and

1916
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,239
our viewer broader than

1917
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,480
the use cases for core m and then where

1918
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,400
the keys would

1919
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,480
fall in a quorum structure is tied to

1920
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,480
co-mids and we didn't really see a good

1921
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,280
way to bend that to support non-commit

1922
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,719
use cases next

1923
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,239
so at the outermost level the structure

1924
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:05,040
is an array it's an array of ta stores

1925
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,360
which is the structure shown here

1926
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,000
which has an optional uh

1927
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,520
language type an

1928
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,760
optional store identity

1929
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,679
required environments

1930
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,520
then some constraints expressed as

1931
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,840
purposes and permitted or excluded

1932
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,719
claims and then the keys themselves

1933
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,199
next slide

1934
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,320
so the store identity was the last thing

1935
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,400
added to the spec and that came after

1936
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,320
talking to the quorum

1937
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,679
folks

1938
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,679
this was included to allow other

1939
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,640
artifacts in aquarium to reference a ta

1940
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,719
store

1941
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,800
so the structure we use here is straight

1942
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,320
from core m

1943
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,880
you can name a store instance within

1944
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,080
that array using a uuid or text and with

1945
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,840
an optional version next

1946
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,960
the environments piece

1947
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,320
attempts to the this is what's most

1948
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,800
roughly analogous to the

1949
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,840
phytoauthenticator id where we're in

1950
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,199
that case there was a very narrow target

1951
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:12,000
to use to look things up

1952
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,239
here it's fuzzier so we pulled in a

1953
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:16,159
definition from comed that's the

1954
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,000
environment map

1955
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,320
we pulled in a definition from co suid

1956
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,760
and that's the abbreviated squid tag

1957
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,679
and that's really just it's the concise

1958
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,679
swood tag definition with all the fields

1959
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,800
made optional except for one

1960
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,760
and then a free form text name

1961
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,320
so next

1962
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,560
in terms of constraints

1963
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,080
you know overt constraints the

1964
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,520
environments are kind of a constraint

1965
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,960
too

1966
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,960
we have this eku-like

1967
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,600
ta purpose where we list out different

1968
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,440
things you might verify with a trust

1969
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,400
anchor

1970
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,640
we do have a draft written for lamps

1971
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,560
that we didn't submit before this ietf

1972
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,360
that maps all of these to voids

1973
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,159
um you know if this progresses that'll

1974
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,879
follow suit

1975
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,400
and there would likely need to be a

1976
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,400
registry for purpose values because this

1977
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,320
would need to be extensible next

1978
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,440
um here we have just permitted and

1979
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:17,199
excluded claim values

1980
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,800
and that's just using the definition

1981
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,600
straight from heat

1982
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,080
next slide

1983
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,560
and then keys this is kind of the meat

1984
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,560
and potatoes

1985
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,040
we require at least one trust anchor and

1986
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,920
then you can include ca certificates if

1987
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,360
you want

1988
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,280
the trust anchors we define three

1989
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,120
different formats

1990
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,760
a certificate a bear public key encoded

1991
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,400
as a subject public key info

1992
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,600
and an rfc 5914 trust anchor info

1993
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,960
structure

1994
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,880
we've gotten an off list comment that we

1995
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,600
should include json and cbor formatted

1996
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,080
keys too and that seems right to me so

1997
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,880
we'll add that i think just as a trust

1998
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,120
anchor expression not to the cas list

1999
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:05,199
which seems appropriate is just x 509

2000
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:08,400
next slide

2001
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,960
as far as security mechanisms we inherit

2002
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,600
from core m which uses cose

2003
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,360
and we add the extra

2004
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,679
piece to verify using a trust banker

2005
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,080
that has the cot's purpose

2006
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,440
asserted

2007
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,199
obviously somewhere back down this line

2008
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,040
there has to be some out of band

2009
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,880
bootstrapping

2010
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,440
next slide

2011
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,920
things we left out

2012
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,120
include

2013
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,800
how to use this stuff for verification

2014
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,560
we have a draft written

2015
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,679
it's not yet complete

2016
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,880
next

2017
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,640
and actually on that point it's not all

2018
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,480
together clear where some of the stuff

2019
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,000
should go because

2020
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,760
this spec sits sort of at an

2021
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,199
intersection between rats and lamps

2022
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:54,880
so we'll see

2023
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,360
next slide

2024
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,040
as far as

2025
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,600
high level questions in my mind is uh

2026
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,560
the quorum extension the way forward

2027
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,400
had two voices on the list that that

2028
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,239
support doing this as a quorum extension

2029
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,480
i'm on the fence about how the

2030
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,560
environments are defined whether or not

2031
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,000
we could

2032
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,560
squeeze out some common identity

2033
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,159
characteristics from the co-mid and

2034
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:21,679
coast with instead of having the

2035
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,679
environment map and the abbreviated

2036
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,760
squid tag

2037
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,760
and then question similar questions

2038
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,440
around the constraints mechanisms do

2039
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,280
they adequately cover what we'd want to

2040
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,440
use to set up these limitations are they

2041
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,880
overkill should there be something extra

2042
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,280
and so forth that's all i had so except

2043
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,280
for questions so we've got two in the

2044
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,519
queue

2045
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,320
uh

2046
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,239
dave taylor thanks for presenting this i

2047
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,880
didn't know about this until uh the

2048
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,199
presentation here so very interesting

2049
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,159
um

2050
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,840
uh if i unders if i understand right

2051
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,040
you're actually configuring the trust

2052
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,360
anchors themselves in a in the receiver

2053
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,960
is that correct

2054
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,080
um

2055
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:02,960
so

2056
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,120
this is we have a need for this in more

2057
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,760
than just rats right so teep relies on

2058
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,760
configuring trust anchors suit reliant

2059
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,840
configuring trust anchors

2060
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,280
so my question is do you think that this

2061
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,520
work is actually specific to rats

2062
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,440
or is this a more generalizable thing

2063
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,719
and this gets to the answers to all the

2064
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:20,719
questions you have up there

2065
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:22,560
i think it's more general i don't know

2066
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,199
where the best forum for it is we chose

2067
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:26,480
here because

2068
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,480
quorum was the way that we chose to

2069
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,760
express this

2070
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,639
sure um just if it's not specific to

2071
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,159
rats i think we might actually reference

2072
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:35,679
and use this from teep and we might

2073
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,040
actually be able to reference and use it

2074
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,239
from suit for which one of the

2075
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:42,320
co-authors is a co-chair um and so um i

2076
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,040
don't know if rats is the best working

2077
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,800
group for this but i think it's very

2078
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,239
interesting work so that's why i'm

2079
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,560
asking these questions

2080
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,000
i may have a follow-up after kathleen

2081
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,239
yes

2082
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,040
i i was also unaware kathleen moriarty

2083
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,320
as a participant i was also unaware of

2084
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,440
the draft i should have been aware sorry

2085
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,960
i was

2086
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:05,920
not as

2087
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,159
tall as everybody else

2088
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:09,679
um

2089
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:10,960
now

2090
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,719
one thing so i would like to follow it

2091
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,320
wherever it winds up

2092
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,000
but um

2093
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,600
in terms of

2094
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,560
like coast with how is adoption of that

2095
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,360
is that the right choice

2096
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,360
well i mean this is early days for all

2097
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,360
of this stuff right

2098
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,880
that's why i want to raise it now so i

2099
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,520
think some consideration on

2100
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,520
what that format should be if there's

2101
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,360
really adoption of co-switch or not or

2102
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,719
is coswood

2103
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,320
falling to the side in favor of other

2104
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,719
formats that are starting to pick up in

2105
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:43,120
terms of adoption from a high level i

2106
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,520
want to get across the keys and some

2107
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,840
means of limiting where they fit right

2108
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,000
so you don't leave trust anchors wide

2109
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,600
open like web pki for example um

2110
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,679
we don't have as tight of a target as

2111
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,840
fido which is what we looked at

2112
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,000
and figuring out what the right

2113
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
environment expression and constraint

2114
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,520
expression is kind of the work to be

2115
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,360
done we took this shot

2116
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,920
um if i mean we don't want to target

2117
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,239
things that aren't used that

2118
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,000
way us down

2119
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,360
so i don't know i mean these are two

2120
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,040
questions i can't say that i could

2121
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,560
answer where should it be

2122
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,920
i don't know

2123
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:18,880
is that

2124
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,600
swit i think is is is

2125
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,960
is used

2126
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,800
but i don't know about coast guard sweat

2127
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,560
is used but i

2128
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,800
think and people who are at vendors i am

2129
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,320
not at a vendor i'm at center for

2130
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,840
internet security

2131
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,159
um it seems that other formats are

2132
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:37,520
picking up

2133
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,120
traction now

2134
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,800
and um this is it seems to be dying off

2135
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,920
but

2136
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,840
perhaps a survey of that would be useful

2137
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,600
so that's actually something my team

2138
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,840
might be able to help with well it gets

2139
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,080
it as a neutral entity at the question

2140
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,880
here could we could we carve out some

2141
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,280
common characteristics maybe that's what

2142
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,040
we do and then it could be used with a

2143
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,960
coast with or used with something else

2144
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,360
but isn't overtly defined in terms of

2145
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,880
anything else

2146
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,560
right so i don't have any answers but i

2147
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,199
will offer i i have some interns that

2148
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,880
can help and we're at a neutral

2149
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,880
organization so if

2150
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,800
vendors want to talk to us and

2151
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,199
help us sort through what what formats

2152
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,880
are are being adopted

2153
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,960
we would be happy to compile that

2154
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,120
kathleen may be useful for you to list

2155
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,040
your organization

2156
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,560
you introduced yourself but you didn't

2157
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,400
see your organization i did say it

2158
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,480
center for internet security well the

2159
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,480
good news is is that if you're gonna

2160
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,159
call for adoption you said you want at

2161
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:36,320
least three reviewers so i think we just

2162
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,679
counted two

2163
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:39,760
and we already had one so we might be in

2164
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:40,960
good shape for

2165
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,560
reviewers

2166
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,639
not yet but i'm saying we have some

2167
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:47,679
interest to sustain

2168
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,760
well it gets to the question of

2169
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,960
scope and

2170
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,280
rats

2171
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:56,000
so um first a lot of things

2172
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,480
unfortunately this is hank um so first i

2173
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,400
saw the cd there i already saw i read

2174
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,639
the draft um

2175
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,880
i see the high synergy and reuse of

2176
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,239
types

2177
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,320
and i see how that helps your work so

2178
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,679
i'm absolutely fine this being an

2179
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,840
extension of column as uh speaking as a

2180
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,679
one of the authors of korean right

2181
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:15,360
because that is just

2182
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,440
there and reinventing that would be like

2183
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,199
weird and i'm happy that you find reuse

2184
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,120
in some of these structures so excellent

2185
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,159
thank you

2186
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,120
um

2187
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,760
be it close with or something else

2188
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,520
i'm pretty agnostic too

2189
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,719
i'm very

2190
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:31,920
involved as a contributor to spdx

2191
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,800
for two years now and uh they just

2192
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,679
recently for the 2.30 uh version

2193
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,679
uh put in a pointer to to it because

2194
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:44,880
pspdx is not really good at being small

2195
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,960
and so they were like okay if you want

2196
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,239
to have small

2197
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,480
uh file system references and such as uh

2198
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,560
characteristics you you that can point

2199
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,760
to there if you will go through this

2200
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,120
domestic build

2201
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,360
not interesting to you due to get bomb

2202
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,480
references and so uh yeah i think

2203
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,120
um coast width is has its place in the

2204
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,719
iot realm

2205
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:06,560
it's definitely going to be the part of

2206
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,840
uh

2207
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,040
but um

2208
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:09,920
as

2209
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,080
spx matures and that is meaning 3.0

2210
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,280
um

2211
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,120
there might be a concise s-bomb

2212
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,600
and we can look at that but that is here

2213
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,080
this is next year so so that is there

2214
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,600
that is very concise there's no better

2215
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,679
becomes more concise way to go into the

2216
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,760
fire system or anything else i'm happy

2217
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,000
to see it well on that point coast with

2218
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,719
just in the last week cleared its final

2219
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,320
hurdle and that working group is

2220
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,400
actually everyone pushed

2221
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,040
so that's done

2222
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,760
thank you by the way and then second

2223
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,639
clause

2224
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:47,639
seriously

2225
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:52,550
[Music]

2226
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,600
to the idea of the binding of this to

2227
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,520
kind of coast with is there this idea

2228
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,639
that we can have format agility

2229
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:07,920
and is that what you were thinking what

2230
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,920
kind of with regards to abstracting what

2231
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,199
you want to do to provide that

2232
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,600
flexibility there may be extensibility

2233
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,440
points we need to add here and there you

2234
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,600
know that the keys already came up that

2235
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,760
way and so they're probably a couple a

2236
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,080
couple of those but i also don't want to

2237
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,120
have

2238
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,199
extensibility everywhere because then

2239
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,320
it's

2240
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,639
i don't know

2241
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:30,840
yeah

2242
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,400
yeah

2243
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,800
all right well that's it thanks okay

2244
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,840
so uh i think what we can do is

2245
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,320
uh call for interest

2246
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,600
and

2247
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,360
topics i think there were some questions

2248
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,560
raised

2249
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,199
with applicability and and posts with

2250
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,400
carl

2251
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,880
so we can at least do that and as you

2252
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,920
said there were at least two

2253
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,920
organizations and individuals that were

2254
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,679
willing to think i don't know we were

2255
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:59,440
also raising your hand to help review

2256
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,719
and provide feedback and comments

2257
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,000
okay

2258
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,440
and i'll post to the list

2259
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,800
no

2260
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,000
yeah

2261
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,800
and we will volunteer

2262
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:22,239
mechanically how does a call for

2263
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:24,880
interest lead to a call for adoption and

2264
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,719
so forth i mean is that a progression

2265
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,800
i've not seen call for interest before

2266
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,800
it's a progression yeah it's the first

2267
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,960
step

2268
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,560
and i'm doing it just because there was

2269
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,040
a question of you know if it's broader

2270
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:42,480
should it be in rats or not

2271
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,199
next up simon

2272
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:54,840
hi uh wave if you can't hear me

2273
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,000
yes excellent marvelous uh first slide

2274
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,239
please

2275
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,040
or next slide please

2276
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,239
okay so eat collections um

2277
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:09,760
is a proposal for a new an extension to

2278
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,760
the top level object

2279
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,800
and it's to use cases where there is no

2280
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,400
obvious or

2281
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,520
maybe varying uh top level signer

2282
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,960
so currently your

2283
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,960
your eat must start with a

2284
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:26,960
cwt wt dev a a signed thing

2285
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,320
um

2286
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,520
but

2287
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,840
the collection we came across various

2288
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,120
use cases

2289
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,320
where

2290
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,480
we don't necessarily have

2291
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,480
just

2292
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,600
um

2293
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,280
we came across various use cases in

2294
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,440
particular with our work on on

2295
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,360
competition computer architecture but

2296
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:50,000
also looking at things like which may

2297
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,080
have originally been based on searching

2298
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,080
where there is no not necessarily an

2299
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,719
obvious top level signer or it's

2300
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:58,639
something that can change

2301
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,000
um so looking at the um

2302
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,960
the search chain example because

2303
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,639
if you're trying to can if you're trying

2304
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,880
to build something from something like a

2305
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,719
dice chain

2306
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:13,360
the leaf or what should be that last

2307
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,719
signer

2308
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:16,159
which would need to encapsulate the

2309
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:19,040
other things can change

2310
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,120
or the number of

2311
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,520
items objects within in the token can

2312
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,320
change so your opportunity to take these

2313
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,360
down into sub mods um is is quite

2314
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,719
constrained

2315
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,960
and this is something we also ran across

2316
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,560
in arm cca because

2317
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,440
the

2318
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,679
nature of the

2319
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:43,040
assigner can change by

2320
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,480
by deployment

2321
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,199
next slide please

2322
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,920
i apologize for the echo i have no idea

2323
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:50,880
why

2324
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,880
let me try and toggle the audio is that

2325
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,080
any better

2326
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,840
i can't hear you now but you may be able

2327
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,400
to you wave if that's better

2328
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,239
we're actually fine simon we weren't

2329
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:01,600
hearing any

2330
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,000
okay sorry i was yeah okay when i try

2331
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,960
and take the audio out from me it

2332
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,440
takes me oh well okay i'm trying to

2333
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,360
apologize for the feedback i don't know

2334
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,880
quite what's happening is that any

2335
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,080
better i've just

2336
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:17,760
lowered the volume from the room

2337
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,920
okay

2338
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,880
because we can hear you fine here in the

2339
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,239
room

2340
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,239
okay

2341
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:29,600
okay because i apologize remotely

2342
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,719
um

2343
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:33,280
okay so this is uh this is to expand on

2344
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,040
that cc example one of the fun um one of

2345
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,560
the fun things we get to play with in

2346
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,239
arm is that our

2347
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:43,840
targets can be many and varied uh in

2348
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,520
architecture from sort of you know major

2349
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,920
major scale cloud servers down to quite

2350
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,840
small things

2351
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,600
so in looking at the

2352
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,800
design of of cca attestation essentially

2353
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,440
things came down initially to

2354
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,320
two logical parts of the token and these

2355
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,159
are formed as each independent um

2356
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:05,280
token

2357
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,639
and the the simplest form um which is

2358
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,719
you round trip to a hardware rot every

2359
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:14,320
time and get it and get something signed

2360
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,480
but then you're because we have

2361
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,320
different components uh in charge of

2362
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:19,120
this

2363
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,679
then what we would do is it was would

2364
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:22,719
pass

2365
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:23,760
um

2366
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,800
a hash of uh of one object to the other

2367
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,120
has a challenge and effectively get

2368
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,199
everything signed in that way um and

2369
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,760
that fits quite nicely with deb

2370
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,440
however if you're in a cloud server

2371
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,960
that's that model doesn't work very well

2372
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,719
you end up with nasty

2373
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,199
potential for bottlenecks so we wanted

2374
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:44,719
to cache the the platform key uh and

2375
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:47,440
sign it with a key that is created uh at

2376
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:51,040
various intervals uh in the workload uh

2377
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,679
object and then suddenly the whole

2378
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:54,800
format

2379
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,159
even though your your individual tokens

2380
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:01,520
um don't really change

2381
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,600
you your your whole format has to change

2382
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,639
because in there now you have a

2383
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,480
different top level signer and it has to

2384
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,679
go into a top one into in into a sub mod

2385
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:11,520
um and there are there's potentially

2386
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,040
other pieces of work in the future which

2387
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,199
might introduce additional tokens so

2388
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:16,639
this was this is kind of nasty because

2389
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:19,040
you then have lots more code in places

2390
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,360
you don't want lots more code whereas we

2391
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,120
actually wanted to be able to just

2392
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,199
take each of these process each of these

2393
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,320
um

2394
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,120
uh tokens uh independently uh in a

2395
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,080
reference design so instead of having to

2396
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,239
fully reformat the tokens

2397
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:37,679
if each of these um elements

2398
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,080
is is inside is that each each of these

2399
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,000
is an element in the collection they

2400
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,400
have no logical top-level signer but

2401
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,639
they have uh independent

2402
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,840
um

2403
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,560
uh integrity and they have a cross

2404
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,040
um element integrity

2405
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,920
then they can exist in the collection

2406
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:01,199
so next slide please

2407
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,000
so the collection um format is is pretty

2408
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,280
straightforward

2409
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,120
it's a tagged map

2410
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:12,480
contains an optional um profile claim

2411
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,960
which enables you to identify the nature

2412
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,520
of the of the collection and then one or

2413
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,159
more entries and within those entries

2414
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:24,159
those are the your normal um

2415
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:25,520
cwt's

2416
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,000
deadliest etcetera um

2417
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,040
and

2418
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,199
they can have their tags to be

2419
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,040
meaningful within the profile

2420
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,560
and as i say the

2421
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,120
this only works uh if your security is

2422
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,360
is is custom defined

2423
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,800
so that the

2424
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,400
uh integrity of each of the elements can

2425
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,119
be

2426
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:45,040
identified and then take what your

2427
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,800
relationship is there

2428
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,719
and that can be either

2429
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:51,040
one-to-one or you know in chain style or

2430
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,040
one to one to many

2431
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,199
but we think this gives um

2432
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,440
a lot of flexibility for for this kind

2433
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:00,000
of scenario

2434
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,719
next slide please

2435
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,880
um so drafts series 0 went to working

2436
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,600
group i've had various comments back

2437
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,719
um they 0-1 went out

2438
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:16,480
addressing a few minor comments um

2439
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,440
and that had some um uh

2440
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,040
comments um

2441
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,199
more feedback uh which was in things

2442
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:24,400
like you know please emphasize the

2443
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,159
security considerations

2444
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,880
um and allowing for things like one plus

2445
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,320
member

2446
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,800
uh and that is it so i'm actually you

2447
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,080
know what i didn't comment is i would

2448
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,040
like to

2449
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,159
um

2450
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:39,119
pursue this for for adoption but i'm

2451
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:43,440
both interested in comments and review

2452
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,159
and that was it

2453
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,840
any comments or feedback

2454
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:09,159
okay thomas you're in the queue

2455
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:12,639
can you hear me

2456
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:14,239
yes yep

2457
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:17,679
oh hey simon just to be good to to check

2458
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:19,920
this with you you would need a new uh

2459
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,440
media type as well right because this is

2460
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,719
top level

2461
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:24,960
indeed i have i have i wrote that down

2462
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,639
during your presentation

2463
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:27,679
okay

2464
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:28,400
cool

2465
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,719
cheers

2466
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:33,760
yeah so i've spent some time looking at

2467
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,639
this

2468
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,480
and just a couple of comments that i've

2469
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,239
made i'm not sure i made them publicly

2470
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:40,159
but i'll make them publicly now one of

2471
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:43,199
those is that you know i looked at

2472
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:44,159
whether

2473
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:48,080
eat sub mods or the deb could address

2474
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,480
the things the the issues that are

2475
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,800
listed here and i think they actually

2476
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,320
cannot

2477
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,920
so it did bring up some some

2478
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,840
shortcomings in the way

2479
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,760
you know the constructs that are are in

2480
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,400
the eat draft now

2481
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,800
um so from that point of view yeah

2482
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,360
there's some stuff that that uh eats not

2483
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,360
handling in terms of you know kind of

2484
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,440
more complicated

2485
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,880
uh nesting and and uh you know

2486
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:18,719
aggregation of tokens

2487
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:21,199
um one of the use cases that i

2488
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,040
understand here is

2489
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,000
uh that i think simon didn't go into is

2490
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,199
um kind of nested uh

2491
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:31,760
tokens where you know one token is kind

2492
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,800
of attesting to the to the next token um

2493
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,199
i think that's similar to dice the what

2494
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:39,360
the way the ice works i'm not deeply

2495
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,440
familiar with that but

2496
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,119
that was clearly something that is not

2497
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:47,199
handled well by eat sub mods um and i i

2498
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:48,800
to me there seemed like there was an

2499
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,960
interesting opportunity there to define

2500
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,800
some sort of new kind of

2501
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,040
sub mod or some some new kind of nesting

2502
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:58,239
scheme um for uh tokens that to sort of

2503
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,360
mirror what dice does and eat i didn't

2504
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,800
want to do that and eat because we've

2505
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,880
got enough work and eat but um anyway

2506
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:09,199
that that's just a comment on on that uh

2507
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:11,440
there and i'm not really having a strong

2508
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,199
opinion one way or another or the other

2509
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:14,960
on this but just stating there's some

2510
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,880
clearly some some areas that eat is not

2511
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,239
addressing in this

2512
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:18,880
in

2513
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,360
this area

2514
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,960
so i have to admit i haven't been

2515
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,280
tracking to see how many reviewers we've

2516
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,960
had on this draft

2517
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:30,960
so

2518
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,320
show hands

2519
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,360
who's reviewed the document

2520
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,599
two

2521
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,920
okay

2522
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,560
anybody in the chat remote sorry

2523
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,960
okay

2524
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:56,440
yep okay

2525
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:05,440
we can do

2526
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,560
uh solicit more reviews

2527
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:09,360
and

2528
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,600
also see if there's interest

2529
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,480
and then we can talk about adoption

2530
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,480
thank you very much

2531
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:19,119
thanks simon

2532
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,239
well i i have to thank for for the

2533
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:24,480
second round of presenters for staying

2534
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,560
right on time

2535
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,840
because we now have 20 minutes of open

2536
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,000
mic

2537
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:36,360
okay caffeine

2538
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,719
kathleen moriarty i just wanted to

2539
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,880
mention that the attestation set draft

2540
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,040
is not dead uh somebody else is

2541
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,159
beginning to help work on it so

2542
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:52,239
there should be a new revision sometime

2543
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:55,559
between meetings

2544
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:02,400
attestation sets yeah

2545
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,719
okay

2546
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,480
so

2547
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:09,920
now i wanted to come back to the point

2548
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,600
that hank made earlier at the mic which

2549
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,080
came up with a hackathon about uh the

2550
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:17,600
topic here is uh freshness mechanisms in

2551
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,440
a registry

2552
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,760
okay so the context is that in the t

2553
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,840
protocol the t protocol is one that can

2554
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,199
accommodate multiple freshness

2555
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:26,560
mechanisms in other words whether you're

2556
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:29,040
going to use say the nonce claim or the

2557
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,560
time stamp claim right it can be

2558
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,080
negotiated so the protocol lets you

2559
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,520
actually negotiate that and then you use

2560
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:34,960
that with your

2561
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,880
eats or whatever whichever one it does

2562
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,800
and so anytime that you have capability

2563
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,960
negotiation you need an identifier

2564
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,159
to say what the thing is that you're

2565
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:45,600
negotiating okay so currently the posted

2566
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,320
version of the tea protocol spec defines

2567
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,760
a registry

2568
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,760
that has currently three values although

2569
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,800
you could argue whether that's the right

2570
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,880
number maybe show me up two for whatever

2571
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,320
that says uh

2572
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,360
nonce timestamp and epic id although

2573
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,360
epic id is not really well defined yet

2574
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,320
right so that's why you could argue

2575
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,360
maybe that one doesn't go in the

2576
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,600
registry yet okay i ended in an early

2577
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,760
review and said okay what page should we

2578
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,920
put this on the protocol registry okay

2579
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,119
because there isn't a page for like key

2580
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:12,639
parameters or whatever should they

2581
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:13,920
create another one and so that begged

2582
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,000
this question of

2583
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,520
is teep really the only protocol that

2584
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,400
might be negotiating precious mechanisms

2585
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,960
should this be on a tp page

2586
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:25,600
should it be on a rat's page

2587
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,360
and so if it should be on a rat's page

2588
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,040
that says here's any protocol that wants

2589
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,480
to negotiate once here's a registry to

2590
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,320
have identifiers in okay if that goes on

2591
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,000
a rat's page that means you probably

2592
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,679
want to mention this in a rats protocol

2593
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:37,679
document so right hank and i talked at

2594
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:38,960
the hackathon and says if we were going

2595
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,639
to propose this be a rat's registry what

2596
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:42,480
document would you put it in and hank

2597
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,400
said reference interaction models is

2598
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,080
probably the right place for it and so

2599
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,360
that's why we wanted to bring it up here

2600
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,719
and see what the working group thinks

2601
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:50,639
okay because if the word does not want

2602
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:52,080
to do this we'll do it in t but that

2603
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,920
seems to me like the wrong place and

2604
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:56,080
that moving this uh registry definition

2605
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,520
into the reference interaction document

2606
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,360
was what hank and i would prefer so we

2607
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,560
wanted the working group's feedback on

2608
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,719
that

2609
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,040
somebody had a thought about it

2610
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,840
um okay so since you're referencing it

2611
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,520
as a claim

2612
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,520
i can see the value in bringing them to

2613
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,040
rats

2614
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,320
um

2615
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,639
reference sorry yeah the freshness

2616
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:22,960
mechanism is you know how you do in say

2617
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,960
in a need for example do you use the

2618
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,800
what is it the iat or whatever it is

2619
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,800
it's the name of the claim for timestamp

2620
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,400
and nonce is the name of the claim for

2621
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,920
the nonce and so on it says which one of

2622
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,480
those am i going to be using right now

2623
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,159
you could argue which i will argue

2624
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:37,600
against to say you could put that as

2625
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,560
part of the eat profile okay and say you

2626
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,159
have one profile that uses timestamps

2627
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:44,800
and a different profile that uses um

2628
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,040
uh you know nonces and they're a

2629
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,239
required claim and two different

2630
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,639
profiles okay as opposed to a single

2631
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:51,760
profile where they're both in the

2632
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,280
optional claims you must use one or the

2633
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:54,960
other and the profile says that

2634
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,400
that's how e-profile is defined right

2635
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,840
now so you got to use one or the other

2636
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,520
or whatever uh based on whatever you

2637
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,960
negotiate but they're both optional

2638
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:01,920
because you gotta have one of them but

2639
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,679
neither of those mandatory right and

2640
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:05,280
this gets to lawrence's point that says

2641
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,880
maybe not shouldn't be mandatory that

2642
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,080
should be optional and i gave him a big

2643
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,080
thumbs up says yes because we can

2644
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,840
negotiate use of timestamp instead of

2645
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:14,080
that but the rationale to not put it in

2646
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,840
mandatory in the profile is that this is

2647
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,040
only one

2648
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,520
of many different axes in the profile we

2649
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,560
don't want to blow out and have an

2650
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,159
explosion of number of profiles because

2651
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:24,080
it varies by freshness mechanism and

2652
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,600
varies by this and various by that and

2653
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,639
so on that says really should be an

2654
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,159
orthogonal parameter

2655
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:30,159
and a different numbering space not part

2656
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:31,679
of the of the

2657
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:35,520
oid or uri that's the profile definition

2658
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:40,159
okay so if i were to summarize

2659
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:42,239
your

2660
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:43,920
your question is

2661
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,080
that the notion of freshness has more

2662
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,719
value than just inside of t

2663
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:50,400
it's the notion of we could bring it

2664
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,880
into rats

2665
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,800
the proposal just put it in the

2666
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,080
reference interaction models

2667
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,600
draft

2668
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,239
which i think is fine

2669
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:04,560
so my suggestion would be to kick start

2670
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,639
that discussion in the mail list and

2671
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:08,639
work towards putting that as a proposal

2672
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:11,600
and just inserting it into the draft

2673
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,480
and uh you'll get feedback that way

2674
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,920
okay i just want to bring it up here to

2675
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,679
make sure nobody said that is a really

2676
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,600
bad idea that should stay out of scope

2677
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,119
for rats or whatever it sounds like

2678
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:22,400
there would be

2679
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,080
no objections that people are coming up

2680
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,760
with right now to doing that right we

2681
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,360
can put it on the list or whatever but

2682
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,719
it means we could go ahead and put it

2683
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:30,320
into the document as part of you know

2684
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:34,599
the document review process

2685
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:39,679
yeah because this will

2686
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:41,520
remove text out of the t protocol

2687
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,280
document enabling the t protocol

2688
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,719
document itself to progress faster

2689
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:47,119
through the review process so

2690
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:50,159
all right thanks

2691
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,239
uh working group chairs have been asked

2692
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:58,080
to remind everyone that

2693
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,400
the only exceptions to not wearing a

2694
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:01,840
mask in the room is if you are

2695
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:04,000
presenting so if you're up at the mic or

2696
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,360
you're sitting down

2697
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:09,040
keep a mask on this week thank you

2698
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,800
no no no no no you okay nothing okay

2699
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,400
i'll probably that's what i just said

2700
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,679
okay

2701
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:57,040
ah okay that makes sense

2702
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,040
i apologize yeah gary monday i'm going

2703
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,360
to comment back on dave and hank's

2704
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:04,480
earlier suggestion first off uh

2705
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,159
protocol

2706
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,760
right now with the e draft there are

2707
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,239
three freshness mechanisms defined

2708
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:13,520
there's the nonce there's the cti and

2709
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:17,520
there's the iat issued at time cti is um

2710
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,360
i think what they call it

2711
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,440
some sort of index

2712
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,560
so

2713
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,239
um

2714
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:26,080
the thing is is that if we define it

2715
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,520
with the rats

2716
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,600
there are other specifications like for

2717
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:30,400
instance

2718
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:32,239
fido device onboard specification that

2719
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:35,600
use cwt in more broader context than

2720
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:36,960
attestation

2721
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,239
so that's what i would be concerned

2722
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:40,080
about the other thing is when you talk

2723
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:43,199
about registries registries can be uh

2724
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:45,040
in theory extensible

2725
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,320
and

2726
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,040
the each spec i don't see any reason to

2727
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,800
expand beyond the three freshness

2728
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,480
mechanisms that are

2729
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:54,000
either so just uh just want to make sure

2730
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,280
that that understanding is coming

2731
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,239
okay lawrence and then hank

2732
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:06,599
yeah so uh oh

2733
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,520
so so the i i i don't have a strong

2734
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,040
opinion one way or the other but a few

2735
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:16,719
questions um uh one question is if i i

2736
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:18,080
didn't think that the number of

2737
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,080
freshness mechanisms was that open-ended

2738
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,880
like there isn't really more than a few

2739
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,560
two or three so why do we need a

2740
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:25,920
registry

2741
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:26,880
um

2742
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,679
okay

2743
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:28,800
um

2744
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,199
the other thing is um

2745
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:32,800
why are we why are we negotiating

2746
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,719
freshness mechanisms but not negotiating

2747
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:37,840
crypto algorithms or or something else

2748
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,960
okay so maybe so there's maybe a basic

2749
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,960
uh interaction model here like you know

2750
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,560
particularly with eat there's definitely

2751
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,480
no negotiation there like jose there's

2752
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,639
no negotiation there so

2753
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:51,119
but uh so okay so so you understand

2754
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:53,679
where i was going

2755
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,639
yeah so just to answer in the t protocol

2756
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:58,960
and negotiates both cypher suites and

2757
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:01,360
freshness mechanisms and the handshake

2758
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,280
so one side says here's my supported set

2759
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:05,040
of freshness mechanisms

2760
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,199
often just one right and here's my set

2761
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:09,119
of cypher suites and then in the

2762
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,119
response it can then include an

2763
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:12,719
attestation payload which could be

2764
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,159
evidence or could be at the station

2765
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,880
results if it's in the uh passport model

2766
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:19,840
right okay so

2767
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,320
on the question of um are there

2768
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,159
additional ones besides those three and

2769
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,560
this gets the question of um the

2770
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,800
reference interaction models document

2771
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,800
is technically not eat specific

2772
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,159
and technically neither is the rat's

2773
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:34,000
architecture right and that is because

2774
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,600
it accommodates proprietary formats

2775
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,760
right at the t package on table we had

2776
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,159
people using a proprietary attestation

2777
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:43,280
format meaning sgx reports okay sgx

2778
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,600
reports don't use suit or each claims at

2779
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,480
all

2780
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:49,280
do they have a freshness mechanism sure

2781
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,639
it's a proprietary one that's existed

2782
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:52,560
for a long time right arm probably has

2783
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:53,920
one too that exists and they're already

2784
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,119
deployed

2785
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:58,320
attestation mechanism and so the nonce

2786
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,320
claim for example has a specific set of

2787
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,000
bite-sized ranges right it must be

2788
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,360
between

2789
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,119
i remember it was 8 and 64 bytes or

2790
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:06,480
something like that right so you can

2791
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,480
imagine someone that says well i've got

2792
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,199
a six byte one or a 60 you know a 72

2793
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:13,040
byte one or whatever therefore it's not

2794
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,719
the same thing

2795
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:16,480
as what knots would be registered as

2796
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:18,000
because that means it not claim you

2797
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,920
could argue that that needs a different

2798
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,119
precious mechanism number in the

2799
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:23,920
registry and so somebody like a vendor

2800
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:26,080
like intel or arm should be allowed to

2801
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,599
register a freshest mechanism that's the

2802
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:29,920
one that they're already using

2803
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,520
okay so there might be three standard

2804
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:34,719
ones or whatever the number is two four

2805
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:36,239
and there could be vendor-specific ones

2806
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:37,199
for things that are already deployed

2807
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:39,199
that are in use right now

2808
01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:43,119
so that's why it would be registry

2809
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:45,840
sorry just to jump the cube but briefly

2810
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,440
uh i think there is a bit of a

2811
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,560
negotiation

2812
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:51,440
uh thing for eat through profiles as

2813
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,679
thomas showed in his uh

2814
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:54,639
uh

2815
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:57,840
media types thing

2816
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,639
hi this is hank um so maybe probably

2817
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:07,520
around closing remarks on this topic um

2818
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:10,320
the interaction models basically are

2819
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:12,639
flavors of these freshness

2820
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:15,280
um characteristics that we have and so

2821
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,280
that's why we put it in there because to

2822
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,000
differentiate those and i think again as

2823
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
uh they've already highlighted there are

2824
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,679
existing solutions that will benefit

2825
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:26,000
from classification like that and they

2826
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
can easily tailor it around them

2827
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,080
and uh yeah i heard that especially for

2828
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,840
the epoch id for example

2829
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,840
um

2830
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,599
any other

2831
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:48,560
comments issues

2832
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:52,920
nope

2833
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:01,520
