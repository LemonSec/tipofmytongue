treat each other with respect and uh

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,059
that will lead us to the better

18
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,879
technical solution we don't want to lock

19
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,859
anyone out of the discussion

20
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,619
and at this particular meeting in

21
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,200
addition please wear your mask in the

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,740
session and only the presenter should be

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,339
maskless

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,580
we have a long agenda but it turns out

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,180
some of the things are not going to

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,979
happen today so we might actually get

27
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,740
through it we'll see

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,720
um the

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,439
first group of documents or the things

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,420
that are with either the RFC editor or

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,420
the isg

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,540
and so we'll only be talking about those

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,360
in terms of what's changed as they've

34
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,820
gone through the process

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,899
then in the pkx related documents just

36
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,540
a day or so ago Tim declared that we've

37
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,079
reached consensus on 3709 fifths so the

38
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,700
only thing we're waiting for that to

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,860
move to the higher category is the

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,100
shepherd right up

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,380
and the next one's the yes Mom documents

42
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,140
we have not seen those documents updated

43
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,560
since the last ietf

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,700
so um

45
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,160
there's probably not much that we'll be

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,900
talking about today

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,140
in fact I did not get slides

48
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,300
and then there's the dot list of

49
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,640
documents that uh

50
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,640
guess Roman no I just wanted to so

51
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,200
romantic if you could flip back a slide

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,580
I just wanted to say kind of thank you

53
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,220
for everyone with the agility we had on

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,560
the lamp CMP kind of update when we went

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,680
to the isg we got some feedback on the

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,900
editorial style and the and the length

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,900
of time in the in the old kind of new it

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,519
was explained kind of how we got there

59
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,980
kind of organically as a process there's

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,480
still kind of a little there was still a

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
little bit of a rub so kind of thank you

62
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360
for kind of the rapid reaction and the

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,980
commitment to do kind of a fullbus this

64
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,780
was really key to getting us over the

65
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,640
Finish Line it's you know it'll give us

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,780
something immediately for the community

67
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,700
and then we can work kind of a lot long

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,200
term on that so again got a big thank

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,720
you as a team effort across kind of all

70
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,599
sorts of things to get this so much the

71
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,340
bulk of that thank you goes to Hendrick

72
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,480
foreign

73
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,099
and then there's a whole slew of

74
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,700
documents that we're going to consider

75
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,220
uh for adoption and of course most of

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,379
them are post Quantum related there's a

77
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,879
couple that are not

78
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,900
my intent is to deal with uh in terms of

79
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,940
processing them

80
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,299
deal with the not pqc related ones first

81
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,200
to get them off the plate and and then

82
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,360
the pqc ones we have a little more

83
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,120
Runway we're waiting on nist and so on

84
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,900
but the uh the order somewhat reflects

85
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,760
that and then some other things came in

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,459
at the end so uh we'll deal with them as

87
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,319
they do

88
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,238
um any agenda bashes

89
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,980

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,160

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,660
minor uh

117
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,360
clarifications that were requested so we

118
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,639
did that and so

119
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,120
okay so I saw the um document was posted

120
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,280
yesterday I looked at the diff I hope

121
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,080
others did too

122
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,280
but

123
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,940
um they were basically all to address uh

124
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,000
comments from Roman if I remember right

125
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,440
[Laughter]

126
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,720

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,860
document and yeah if we do that I would

173
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,940
also propose to provide a

174
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,520
6712 business document scmp updates also

175
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,180
update this RFC

176
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,960
um

177
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,900
we discussed this already last ietf and

178
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,539
I will come back to to this topic on my

179
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,919
last slide so I'll yeah just since last

180
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,440
ITF we updated as discussed at IDF 113

181
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,660
um the well-known pass and the

182
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,300
definition of the pass segment PE for

183
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,900
profile RCA names

184
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,060
good

185
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,440
likewise TMP profile there were some

186
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,799
minor updates since last ITF

187
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,640
um

188
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,440
also

189
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,899
some clarifications coming from

190
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,200
implementations and alignment with CMP

191
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,880
updates regarding the well-known pass

192
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,220
segment

193
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,220
and some editorial stuff but nothing

194
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,640
much to to say about it

195
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,920
um yeah we are waiting for

196
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,519
um

197
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,140
a d-review and looking forward to the

198
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,240
valuable feedback will will probably

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,580
receive

200
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,160
um Roman can can you say anything about

201
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,180
when you think you will have time to

202
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,100
to work on this

203
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,920
uh hi this is Roman yeah that's a fair

204
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
fair question it's the next one in my

205
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,839
review queue uh it's just been hard

206
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,180
getting through the previous documents

207
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,920
so I think if you give me a week or two

208
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,200
after after the ITF I'm gonna spin it

209
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,560
back up yeah

210
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,620
location anyhow

211
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,519
good

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,180
got it so European so October one all

213
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,599
right perfect

214
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,800
yeah actually we we in Bavaria are quite

215
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,779
late without summer vacation that's

216
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,019
right

217
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,120
that's funny

218
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,560
good

219
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,880
um coming to uh 4210 bits and 67 12 bits

220
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,519
as already mentioned this was on is on

221
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,399
request of iesg

222
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,000
um they regarded the style of old text

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,740
new text as CMP updates was written as

224
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,060
yeah

225
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,779
not not well for implementers to read I

226
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,420
fully understand this so in the

227
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,240
beginning that was a decision we took um

228
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,019
for this document as we didn't plan to

229
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:39,360
do a general update of CMP but only some

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,060
changes and to be honest there are only

231
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,180
two real changes one is on exchanging

232
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,300
um enveloped encrypted value with

233
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,019
envelope data and the second is to add

234
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,640
an explicit hash elk oid in the set conf

235
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,560
message

236
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,279
um all the other stuff is either fixing

237
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,380
errata or adding some new oids were

238
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,420
already

239
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,980
flexibility was foreseen like for

240
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,140
General messages for example

241
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,060
or defining um an ex

242
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,160
extended key usage value

243
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,220
so yeah now we we have the situation

244
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,579
that we we have to provide these

245
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,540
documents I welcome everyone especially

246
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,300
those who were involved in writing the

247
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,360
original RFC with supporting this

248
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,540
activity from the group of authors or

249
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,360
CMP updates we can

250
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,140
provide a zero zero version that

251
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,660
contains mainly the original RFC text

252
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,620
providing a zero one version providing

253
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,279
the changes provided by defined in CMP

254
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,519
updates and most likely a zero two

255
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,880
version doing some fixes

256
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,899
reported by idnets and maybe switching

257
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,380
here and there to more current rfcs in

258
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,660
in references or aligning some some text

259
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,200
where needed but that is it what we

260
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,360
would plan to to provide

261
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,860
but from the feedbacks from iesg Members

262
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,899
I understood that there will be some

263
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,560
um complete review of the documents

264
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,899
um the best documents and therefore I

265
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,000
would expect

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,380
that there will be some further

267
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,339
discussion going on and I feel like we

268
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,880
need help of the original authors to

269
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,560
get that input on those design decisions

270
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,500
back 2005 in the discussions because we

271
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,200
do not want to define a new certificate

272
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,519
management protocol but let's say only

273
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,279
do some adaptations

274
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,100
to CMP where needed for the lightweight

275
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,600
profile at least that was the original

276
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,920
aim

277
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,440
therefore everyone especially those

278
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,700
authors

279
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,480
um

280
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,760
from the original rfcs are welcome to

281
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,760
join in I send out an email to those

282
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,700
last week but didn't get any feedback

283
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,899
yet so any feedback is welcome also if

284
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,279
they step back from co-authoring that's

285
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,700
also good but then I at least know and

286
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,180
yeah do not miss some some feedback

287
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,480
yeah so that's it um there are people in

288
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,920
the queue

289
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,160
so Mike

290
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,199
Ellsworth I'm a co-author on this I just

291
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,760
wanna I really want to highlight what

292
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,560
Hendrick just said I mean opening up

293
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,300
this up to Abyss I think is going to

294
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,579
open up questions like why not TLS why

295
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,740
not hpke and

296
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,839
within the author group we have some

297
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,940
historical knowledge here but probably

298
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,160
not enough to field all of that so help

299
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,959
from the working group to deal with

300
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,360
whatever comes out of review please so

301
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,540
all right um completely agree that this

302
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,199
is a document the protocol effort not a

303
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,320
redesigned the protocol effort uh

304
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,279
further this document being

305
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,339
from 2005

306
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,540
is what we call pre-5378

307
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,199
the IPR regime has changed

308
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,740
and 5378 is the is the Watershed event

309
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,060
where that IPR change so we do need

310
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,100
permission from all the authors

311
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,720
to get their rights so

312
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,300
the original authors yes

313
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,399
and so even if they don't want to

314
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,959
contribute to this effort they need to

315
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,779
give us the rights to continue and so I

316
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,959
hope that does not become the roadblock

317
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,540
Roman uh so hi Roman Union responsible

318
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,820
ID so I want to want to pick up on two

319
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,980
things that might help us uh help us

320
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,899
with a Glide slope here and one of them

321
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,760
is directly related to how big of a box

322
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,220
we're going to open here so procedurally

323
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,180
this is actually going to be an

324
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,560
interesting situation I haven't

325
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,720
encountered before because what often

326
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,880
happens outside the SEC area when you

327
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,740
open up you open up the protocol

328
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,660
security is always very concerned will

329
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,940
you make me update and upgrade all the

330
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,259
security kind of properties and there's

331
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:32,759
a bit of a negotiation that sometimes

332
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,259
happens as to why this document is

333
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,360
produced what they what the intent is

334
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,040
really to miss and whether we we're

335
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,839
going to reopen the can of worms on the

336
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,459
security considerations so one of the

337
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,839
things that would kind of kind of help

338
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,820
me as we talk about it in the working

339
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,880
group is let's kind of iron out I mean

340
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,079
we know why we're making this update

341
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,000
this is a push from the isg let's talk

342
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,680
about the places where that might be hot

343
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,660
spots that there might be discussions

344
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,399
update but we don't want to and I can

345
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,259
have a conversation with the isg about

346
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,240
how to how to handle that I mean this

347
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,800
this sometimes kind of occurs typically

348
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,939
not in SEC documents

349
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,240
uh so so the so asked here is am I

350
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,100
talking about security considerations it

351
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,620
could in other in uh non-sec protocols

352
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,699
it typically is the security

353
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,019
considerations and kind of the

354
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,820
assumptions made here we're probably

355
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,259
talking about fundamental parts of the

356
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:21,959
protocol uh so we we may need a reason

357
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,300
about that uh and then kind of the other

358
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,160
one uh the other kind of thing to do

359
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,959
which I think is just much much easier I

360
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,579
mean Henrik put in kind of some good

361
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,620
work in documenting the implementations

362
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,959
which also helped with the Glide slope

363
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,820
for approval here so I you know I would

364
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,620
kind of urge you know to document that

365
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,060
really well as we bring this document

366
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,160
forward to really show that we're

367
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,040
putting in ietf documents the state of

368
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,380
play uh the state of play and that also

369
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,120
kind of helps with how wide of a box we

370
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,759
have when we when we reopen it so Roman

371
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,440
are you suggesting in advance in um

372
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,240
the

373
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,380
uh proposed to full

374
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,660
you mean putting that as table Stakes

375
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,160
what's changed what's not in advance

376
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,740
well no I mean one of the things we

377
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,160
often do is document the what

378
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,559
implementations exist and so on we know

379
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,900
we have more than two interoperable

380
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,260
implementations so we could just uh try

381
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,880
to put the best documents to full

382
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,380
standard

383
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,619
uh yeah we we could I guess I don't have

384
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,119
an answer of that like right now okay

385
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,980
yeah we should kind of figure out I mean

386
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,660
if that's what we want to do I mean I

387
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,280
mean I see no reason I was thinking

388
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,679
something less ambitious uh really just

389
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,600
document it really well in the shepherd

390
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,640
report as kind of justification for the

391
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,080
design choices but if we want to go a

392
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,940
little further I mean if and we and we

393
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,260
clearly have the implementations we

394
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,580
certainly could we do okay

395
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,080
we'll have that discussion we'll we'll

396
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,000
have that discussion at some other point

397
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,580
I guess but uh pointed out we have

398
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,480
another

399
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,940
oh my goodness

400
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,780
sorry yeah

401
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,600
okay can we uh can we get a couple

402
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,539
people to open up the the notes link and

403
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,080
help us out

404
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,160
please thank you

405
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,100
two people would be awesome

406
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,360
oh

407
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,600
thank you thank you so much and

408
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,179
appreciate it

409
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,480
so that was a question on the IPR

410
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
um

411
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,559
um thing go ahead

412
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,419
um I I guess

413
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,480
um Ross please correct me we fixed this

414
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,360
with contacting the original authors and

415
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,780
they all provided the right to switch to

416
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,160
the current

417
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,740
Ah that's awesome good news

418
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,380
yeah so this should be documented on the

419
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,799
list in the mail archive if needed I

420
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:54,860
could figure out which emails that was

421
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,100
now that's just awesome news I I forgot

422
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,580
that we did that for for the updates

423
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,379
contacted them but thank you

424
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,140
okay and I don't see anyone else in the

425
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,600
queue any other

426
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,160
all right let's move to the next

427
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,539
presentation

428
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:19,220
thank you Henry thanks

429
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,880
uh so the next one is

430
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
uh 3709 yes

431
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,640
um nothing's changed since uh

432
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,900
this document that has uh just last week

433
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,660
had consensus called

434
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,720
um so the next one on the agenda is

435
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,140
header protection uh dkg or Alexa here

436
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,799
are both here anything to scare

437
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,160
good

438
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,900
uh hi this is Daniel Gilmore

439
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,419
um no there's it's been a little bit

440
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,520
stalled which is on me

441
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,100
um I we have I think

442
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,919
reach agreement about the way to handle

443
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,900
that there was one piece of subtlety

444
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,780
that came up at the last meeting that we

445
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,799
discussed around for header protection

446
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,320
uh around how the recipient should know

447
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,940
what happened when the header

448
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,100
confidentiality policy was applied

449
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,220
and I uh I think we reached an agreement

450
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,600
on what should happen there and I have

451
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
failed to write it down and produce the

452
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,919
samples so I'm still working on that

453
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,280
okay so sorry for the delay so was that

454
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,980
uh something that we're likely to

455
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,440
resolve by the next Ito yes awesome

456
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,480
because I I really was hoping to clear

457
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,539
this before we dig into the pqc stuff

458
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,760
yep right it is it is something that I'm

459
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,980
aiming to get done before then okay

460
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,299
don't sit down yet okay

461
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:53,340
same question for end-to-end mail

462
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,740
guidance yeah so the engine mail

463
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,240
guidance I have not gotten a lot of

464
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,860
feedback from which is a little bit uh

465
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,919
distressing to me because I know that

466
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,020
there are people in this room uh and

467
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,240
people who are remote and people who are

468
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,159
on the mailing list who have experience

469
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,179
to share

470
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,039
and we have not gotten a lot of

471
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,559
additional uh suggestions the document

472
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,419
has fixmes if you don't want to say hey

473
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,820
I've got an idea I want to add but you

474
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,679
want to just uh pitch in and say I think

475
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,880
I know how to solve this particular

476
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,640
problem I would welcome that

477
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,120
um I am trying to record the things that

478
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,520
I have uh uncovered in terms of like the

479
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,740
kinds of paper cuts that people actually

480
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,780
have

481
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,659
uh and I would love to have more uh

482
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,299
contributors on that I'm gonna I know

483
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,039
that it is expired right now

484
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,020
um and I will refresh it and I will fill

485
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,760
in some of the fixmes but I really hope

486
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,440
that some of the other expertise in the

487
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,380
room will contribute their hard-earned

488
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,280
lessons uh for everybody else so uh

489
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,380
again I'm I'm I'm behind on this but I

490
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,460
really would appreciate more people

491
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,140
stepping up with with uh suggestions

492
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,640
okay so um this is Russ I promise to

493
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,840
read it and

494
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,000
joining the discussion are there any

495
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,340
other s mime implementers willing to

496
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,240
make the same commitment

497
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,380
good thank you

498
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,020
for the notes that was Alexi

499
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,940
go ahead Rich yeah do you know Alec

500
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,539
Muffet Rich point it down

501
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:27,080
where your mouth is

502
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,860
[Laughter]

503
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,120
um you might want to reach out to him

504
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,640
because and Alec is big on end-to-end

505
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,080
security stuff I don't know how much

506
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,700
experience he has with s mime in

507
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,280
particular but

508
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,260
okay

509
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,400
okay

510
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,500
I also said that so I could walk to the

511
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,440
front and sit down without me

512
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,780
how clever

513
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,170
[Laughter]

514
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:56,820
um Alex I did read the earlier version

515
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,940
and I think

516
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,280
um I had some minor comments I think the

517
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,820
big part is about terminology used just

518
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,679
because it's not fully aligned with

519
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,320
email terminology

520
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,780
uh but I think once it's fixed it's

521
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,039
going to be

522
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,460
so but yeah I'm I'll commit to doing a

523
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,320
review again and I'll send you all the

524
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,620
comments

525
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,159
okay uh Michael Richardson you're next

526
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,419
okay am I close enough to the microphone

527
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:45,179
good

528
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,039
um all right I'll come back to the first

529
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,840
slide that I you know just copied and

530
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,360
pasted from last time uh it's a terrible

531
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,700
title I would love to better title you

532
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,799
know something more cool

533
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,500
um next pardon me more cool more cool

534
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,020
yeah with like bigger smaller more

535
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,419
smaller words I don't know

536
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,279
um

537
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,600
uh yeah

538
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,620
um so

539
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,720
um The Story So Far

540
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,320
um so uh RFC uh 70 30 which is EST

541
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,679
enrollment over secure transport was a

542
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,900
little bit unclear about CSR attributes

543
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,220
which is a thing that actually it

544
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,380
created

545
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,500
um we over in anima used it uh the way

546
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,320
that we thought that it worked

547
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,539
and uh I don't quite remember how we

548
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,940
came across the fact that this was

549
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,460
probably wrong maybe because of the the

550
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,159
the CMP work that Hendrick is doing

551
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,039
um for me I think it was Sean it was

552
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,720
Sean yeah someone noticed that we did it

553
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,279
wrong

554
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,960
um

555
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,120
and anyway we had a virtual intro

556
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,760
meeting at the end of August 2021

557
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,080
um there's some links if you want to go

558
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,360
see that talk a lot more about what what

559
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,059
went wrong and we concluded to that we

560
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,039
needed to fix it um and there was a

561
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,720
bunch of different ways of fixing it one

562
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,779
of which was that the our interpretation

563
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:05,580
was correct and the document was wrong

564
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,679
and another one was that the document

565
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,679
was right and our interpretation was was

566
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,799
broken and um

567
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,520
um

568
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,220
that uh you know we went through a

569
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,559
couple cycles and we actually concluded

570
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,480
the document was vague and wrong and

571
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,480
that our interpretation was also wrong

572
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,580
so

573
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,200
uh so the the last time in Vienna

574
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,020
um Sean said uh you know what we just

575
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,460
need this extra layer of extension

576
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,799
request that that the document was kind

577
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,960
of right just didn't really clearly say

578
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,020
that so next slide please

579
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,299
so this is what we were doing

580
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:48,360
okay we were saying hey we want this

581
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,159
subject alt name so we'll put that in

582
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,360
and uh please do something okay and we

583
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,980
have writing code that that does this

584
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,320
and it's wrong

585
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,960
um next slide please

586
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,059
so this is what it looks like now this

587
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:05,220
is what we would do okay so we would

588
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,960
start off with this extension request

589
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,960
and within that we put an extension

590
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,200
exactly what we want it's a three item

591
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,480
thing with a critical bit in there the

592
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,279
Boolean

593
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,039
um subject an oid and a value at the end

594
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,020
or a set of values or a sequence of

595
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,940
values there

596
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,980
um and that's really it so all the other

597
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,740
uses where you say I want you to use

598
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,100
algorithm one two three here's the oid

599
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,320
um those all remain the same

600
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,140
so I think Dan had the question but we

601
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,640
didn't want to break what was on The

602
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,580
Wire already for other other people this

603
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,400
is what it looks like right now uh I

604
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
would invite you to you know

605
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,480
think about that

606
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,059
um and uh next slide please that's

607
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,279
really it

608
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,320
yeah so questions

609
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,240
we think we're ready to for the working

610
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,700
group to adopt it we can then fill in

611
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,679
some additional examples so that's one

612
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,179
request out there if you have any

613
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,580
running code that does anything at all

614
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,940
with 70 30 then consider you know

615
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,820
Conjuring up an example for us and run

616
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,520
it through dump as and one so that we

617
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,980
can really say you know to people when I

618
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,919
wrote my code I I uh I went through the

619
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,760
three examples that were in 7030 and I I

620
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,679
didn't really understand the ASN one to

621
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,020
be honest but I I knew when I had parsed

622
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,899
it right so that was the that was the

623
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,940
key part it's a complicated bit of code

624
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,640
and I think it's a non-trivial they use

625
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,820
the the coolest mechanisms possible so

626
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,299
Sean

627
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,100
hi uh Sean Turner so someone's who

628
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,840
caused all this problem can we adopt

629
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,279
this this seems like a perfect uh

630
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,080
perfectly good draft for the Lambs

631
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,880
working group I don't know that the L

632
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,399
and lamps anymore is true but this seems

633
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:55,860
like a perfectly good reason uh the

634
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,779
really The Joy de V for this working

635
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,899
group was to do this kind of thing so um

636
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:03,299
I would support adoption now

637
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,240
okay does anyone in the room think we

638
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,100
should not adopt this document

639
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,980
so anyone remotely think we should not

640
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,200
adopt the stock

641
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,779
I have a question sure yes so long time

642
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,640
what's your name my name is Roy Williams

643
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,520
I'm Microsoft a long time ago we had an

644
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,500
issue with uh

645
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,480
Japanese subsidiaries putting a stock

646
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,480
ship on us for using etf8 for their

647
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,340
networks because of the large explosion

648
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,320
of content that goes on the wire okay do

649
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,279
we have any

650
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,460
need to use a utf-8 in the in the in

651
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,559
this case here uh so we want to go back

652
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,880
one slide I think that's where he's

653
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,500
reacting

654
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,600
which is probably just left button there

655
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,640
you go

656
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,980
um so

657
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,039
um this is the piece at the bottom here

658
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,520
can I answer that more succinctly

659
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,899
um okay this is using a piece of RC 5280

660
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:03,659
which uses directory spring which is a

661
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,559
choice of which utf-8 is one of yep

662
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,659
that's what I was going to say and and

663
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,460
in in RFC 8994 we say you shall do it

664
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,919
this way but in your network you will do

665
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,260
it the way you want

666
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,100
okay okay so just my example is in utf-8

667
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,559
and that's because that's what a

668
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,480
different RFC says we're doing it for

669
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,399
okay I'm gonna go ahead and make sure we

670
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,140
weren't going to run into a buzz saw of

671
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,179
issues

672
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:34,559
yeah yeah you could you could contribute

673
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,299
an example thank you Rich yes exactly

674
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,919
please contribute an example that's not

675
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,899
in utf-8 so that no one gets confused

676
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,299
next time that would be wonderful thank

677
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,418
you

678
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,240
yes anyone else anyone else

679
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,159
okay all right

680
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,960
um we'll do a call for adopt

681
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,059
foreign

682
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,820
responsibility I will also do the pesky

683
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,500
task of looking at the in scope of the

684
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,299
charter because as we know with lamps we

685
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:16,980
have a rigid list of what's in what's

686
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,240
out

687
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,179
I I believe clarifications is more in

688
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,980
that list

689
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,520
okay

690
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,380
[Laughter]

691
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,860
but

692
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,399
uh

693
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,539
Sean

694
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:45,140
all right

695
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,779
remote people uh yes the remote people

696
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,039
would not hear me but in here they would

697
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,279
uh so hey this is a new draft that came

698
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,620
up it's uh

699
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,600
um basically came as John Madison here I

700
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,039
saw him at the there he is at the back

701
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,720
so he sent an email and said hey you

702
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,700
know the three gpp guys have this way to

703
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,200
put Network function types in

704
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,120
certificates kind of think they're not

705
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,500
really doing it right

706
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,559
what about what we do so we basically

707
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,240
pumped out a really simple draft to

708
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,980
specify a way to do that and that's

709
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,019
really the the whole thing one more

710
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:19,880
slide

711
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,860
and all on that this is my only slide I

712
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,940
want to make sure that we talk about the

713
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,860
pqc stuff more

714
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,600
um so the motivation really again was

715
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,399
this email really is what really

716
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,500
happened but the ideas for these Network

717
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,080
function types for 5G systems right so

718
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,159
they've got the service based

719
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,559
architecture and these

720
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,299
um you know things on the network are

721
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,740
talking and they've got a certain set of

722
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,260
names and you know how do we stick these

723
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,120
things in the in the certificate and

724
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,679
they're all ASCII strings which is

725
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:47,820
really nice because we don't have to

726
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,380
worry about these ETF explosions and

727
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,820
they can keep them apart which is really

728
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,820
nice so a side note I will tell you that

729
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,260
getting through the isg saying

730
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,299
everything is an asci string is a fight

731
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,640
it's going to be hard and it's just

732
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,679
standards like you put it on your back

733
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,500
and you carry it

734
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,240
we put justification for why we're using

735
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,919
ASCII strings to be able to get us out

736
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,779
of this problem so when our responsible

737
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,640
ad is carrying and the serum can be like

738
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,120
they only actually use ASCII strings and

739
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,799
so that's nice of them because it makes

740
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,019
it a little easier because it's smaller

741
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:20,940
um and so there's an actual

742
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,039
um 3gp spec that actually lists what

743
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,559
those things are they are ASCII the only

744
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,000
really that's really weird is they have

745
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,860
an underscore so we'll that's why it's

746
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,380
I5 string and not something else but

747
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,059
um the basic idea about hey where could

748
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,799
you put a name well you can put a name

749
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,260
in an existing naming attribute so you

750
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,000
have you know you have like a subject

751
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,240
name and a certificate Yeah country oh

752
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,220
you know common name you can bang it in

753
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,840
there well that doesn't really seem like

754
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,220
it kind of made me but didn't make much

755
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,480
sense

756
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,220
um you can find another name and general

757
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,500
name no one's going to support that so

758
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,240
good luck with that right so the other

759
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,460
idea is to find a new extension maybe

760
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,899
it's a little easier and that's kind of

761
00:32:57,899 --> 00:32:59,760
what we settled on and we thought

762
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,299
yeah okay and the extension is that it's

763
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:06,120
very simple it is like a sequence of NF

764
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,760
types and we put it you know we went to

765
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,919
go with the all the asml and options so

766
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,059
that we could make sure that we could

767
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,039
kind of like put a size and it's not

768
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,039
kind of unbounded and they're restricted

769
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,679
to 32 characters and lengths and that's

770
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,299
really it

771
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,580
and that's kind of it for the draft and

772
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,620
we think that uh it'd be all right to

773
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,779
specify here because usually in the way

774
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,200
the references the references go right

775
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,600
3gpp oftentimes specifies and points to

776
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,860
the ITF

777
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,720
um rfcs and so we figured we'd do it

778
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,500
here

779
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,539
do them a solid and be done with it and

780
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:40,980
it's a very simple draft and that's

781
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,360
really it

782
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,480
so pretty much the ask is hey did

783
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,519
anybody read it and if you did what do

784
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,360
you think about adopting this

785
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,279
so the um only thing I want to add to

786
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,159
what Sean said is

787
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,480
um

788
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,320
the

789
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:04,380
NF types that are defined in the 3gpp

790
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,119
spec are all eight characters or less

791
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,839
we we forexed it to make sure that we

792
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:13,579
weren't

793
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:17,280
blocking uh you know people but yet not

794
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,339
making it unbounded uh we thought Forex

795
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,440
probably was adequate to deal with that

796
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,659
and of course since I'm a co-author Tim

797
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,440
will make all uh consensus calls on this

798
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,679
John uh yeah

799
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,839
some background so this is this is

800
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,599
already specified in a bad way in PDP

801
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:40,859
which causes problems it has I've been

802
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,839
identified by Erickson as a problem I

803
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,359
think it has been discussed in interrupt

804
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,079
tests and so on but I'm not 100 sure

805
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:51,179
exactly how I don't think there's any

806
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,899
any official formal discussions in 3D

807
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,060
people a new contribution I don't know

808
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,460
if there has been offline discussions

809
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,460
there

810
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,720
I guess all I want to say is to our 80s

811
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,579
if there ever is actually a fight we

812
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,380
they can if they wanted three gpp is

813
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,579
like that's a great idea we're gonna do

814
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,800
it over here great do that like we're

815
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,540
not no one's fighting to like let's keep

816
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,359
it here you know that yeah so we figured

817
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,800
this was just an easy it's like a

818
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,839
literally a slam dunk kind of of uh

819
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,240
internet draft to get to RFC not gonna

820
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,040
take typical three years

821
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,280
let's you know just get it done so I

822
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,020
think the next step is probably to get

823
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,300
3dp input and discussion yeah

824
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,300
thank you

825
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,820
uh yeah I read the draft more

826
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,900
importantly I read the whole email

827
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,460
thread which I think was longer than the

828
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,660
draft it is it is in fact yes

829
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,760
and yeah this seems like an obvious

830
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,280
slam dunk so I fully supported the

831
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,079
option and I'll read the next version of

832
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,359
the draft which is even I'll only read

833
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,300
the diffs it'll be shorted in a minute I

834
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,579
don't know this is you know maybe not

835
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,800
that's good right so my only concern

836
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,359
when I wrote this actually was what was

837
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,300
the string type going to be look do we

838
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,460
have to restrict it like really and it's

839
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,079
it's funny because like if they're like

840
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,099
oh well they're going to keep using

841
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,200
ASCII strings great well it makes it a

842
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,280
little easier because it keeps the cert

843
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,040
smaller which as we know is a thing

844
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,940
right

845
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,460
yeah all right

846
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,900
um so it sounds like a lot of people are

847
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,640
in favor of adopting this as anybody

848
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,500
against adapting this document in the

849
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,760
working group

850
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,619
either in the room or remotely

851
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,839
looks like that's a no so we'll take it

852
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,680
to the list thank you

853
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,940
uh Carl Wallace uh we're gonna do your

854
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,280
kiosk cessation next

855
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,980
uh can you hear me

856
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,800
yes let me just find your slides okay

857
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,460
so the next slide

858
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:22,099
I pass control to you okay good enough

859
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:24,960
um so here's a link to the draft for

860
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,640
those who haven't read it and a link to

861
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,780
the uh

862
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,640
editor's copy I don't think there have

863
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,379
been any changes since the zero zero

864
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,359
uh what we want is to have this accepted

865
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,160
as a working group draft and proceed on

866
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,819
standards track

867
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,099
um why is it necessary

868
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,960
keys can be generated in software or

869
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,540
hardware for a good while now

870
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,260
um

871
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,599
a lot of Hardware modules have been

872
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,579
capable of providing verifiable key

873
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,560
attestations

874
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,540
it's been like a way to pass that to the

875
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,060
ca so it can either tailor certificate

876
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,359
contents or possibly reject requests

877
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,880
that lack the characteristics that it it

878
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,540
desires

879
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,839
so why did we use the web authen at a

880
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,300
station statement format there are a

881
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,800
bunch of different formats for key Atta

882
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,680
stations so this needs to be agile

883
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,660
work that I've done that's been in use

884
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,060
since 2018 used

885
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,380
proprietary oids for each format

886
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,640
but when we set out to write this there

887
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,020
was already a

888
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,420
a Draft Brewing in the Acme group that

889
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,300
was using the web often wormat

890
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,520
so just to make life easier

891
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,540
we um we installed a bunch of text

892
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,740
um

893
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,420
and this question here actually isn't a

894
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,980
question anymore

895
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,500
so I wondered from the beginning whether

896
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,740
or not using the web often registry was

897
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,540
was okay

898
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,579
so I talked to Roman yesterday and he

899
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:59,119
suggested I talked to one of the

900
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,560
registry experts

901
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,839
I passed Mike Jones in the hall and

902
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,820
asked him and he said we'll need a new

903
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,880
registry so we can't reuse the web often

904
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,160
registry for attestation statement

905
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,339
formats that aren't organic to web often

906
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,880
which isn't a particularly big deal

907
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,220
so we'll change the the draft will

908
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,118
change at least for that

909
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,099
um why these various cert request

910
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,440
protocols because we have a load of them

911
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,359
and they all more or less behave the

912
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,400
same with respect to this

913
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,560
this value can be passed as an extension

914
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,000
or an attribute

915
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,220
and because Acme's already covered a

916
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,960
Brandon weeks draft which will be

917
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,060
presented tomorrow at the Acme session

918
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,579
so do we not cover we don't cover format

919
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,220
specific details so that'll be left

920
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,320
to whatever draft is referenced in the

921
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,880
registry

922
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,500
so right now if you look at the web Ops

923
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,300
in the registry all of the statement

924
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,099
formats are defined in the web often

925
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,359
spec

926
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,220
but in the future that might not be the

927
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,399
case

928
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,300
um

929
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:11,060
so we punt those to the the spec formats

930
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,680
I guess I guess that's it there's any

931
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,900
questions

932
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,339
Thomas go ahead

933
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,119
can you hear me

934
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,740
hello

935
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,800
oh hi hi Carl incidentally we picked the

936
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,079
same web often format to to wrap

937
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,640
different kinds of attestation evidence

938
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,940
in our tested TLS extension and uh had

939
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,440
we had the same exact question in regard

940
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,240
to how and where one defines your

941
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,000
performance is is that w3c Ayana someone

942
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,020
else

943
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,940
um so

944
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,980
um if I understand correctly what you

945
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,200
said you are going to create the Ayana

946
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,060
registry in your draft

947
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,440
is is that the case or I misunderstood

948
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,720
uh that's the plan and Sean you can

949
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,180
chime in with more detail on that if you

950
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,280
like

951
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,260
okay another question sorry quick very

952
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,819
quickly is there any need to to

953
00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:12,180
coordinate with w3c on that or is it

954
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,859
something that we just do

955
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,020
unilateral link so I mean we're just

956
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,960
using the the format as it's defined in

957
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,000
defining a place to register register

958
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,160
this stuff for this purpose I I don't

959
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,319
see why that would need coordination but

960
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,119
I have not asked that question of anyone

961
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,619
okay

962
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,240
um anyone else

963
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,980
yeah so to add a little more concrete

964
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,900
there we're just you know we have Ayanna

965
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,940
so we'll use them to run the registry so

966
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,319
we'll just specify what the name of the

967
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:39,300
new registry is and go from there it'll

968
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,400
be pretty straightforward I'm sorry to

969
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,319
jump in there

970
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:46,099
staphon

971
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,540
yeah I'm trying to unmute but I think I

972
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,020
succeeded um so it's the the purpose of

973
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:03,119
this to uh to Signal uh the um

974
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,780
the the aspects of the private key that

975
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,359
is associated with these public key of

976
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,920
the certificate right

977
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,599
that's right

978
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,000
so um I'm not saying that you shouldn't

979
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,220
do this this way I just want to report

980
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,579
that there isn't a Noble app with uh

981
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,520
Etsy has since many many years ago a

982
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,400
mechanism in the qualified certificate

983
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,700
statements extension reporting on the

984
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,800
aspects of the private key associated

985
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,619
with the certificates it's used mainly

986
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,560
to say that this is a qualified uh

987
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,720
signature creation device but you can

988
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,420
you can register any kind of identifier

989
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,240
for whatever type of key protection you

990
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,000
have there so um just to make you aware

991
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,040
that there is such a function that is

992
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,020
widely deployed already

993
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,540
well I mean the problem is that the Web

994
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,819
authen format is also widely deployed

995
00:42:56,819 --> 00:42:59,700
and uh yeah you know we're not creating

996
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,579
this condition where I'm just choosing

997
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,800
to to piggyback off of this that exists

998
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,420
yeah

999
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,119
yeah I just just wanted to uh point you

1000
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,880
to to the fact that this also exist

1001
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,980
I suspect Brandon will say more about

1002
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,660
this tomorrow in Acme so if you're

1003
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,220
around tomorrow Give a listen to that

1004
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,640
Bonnie yeah much wise wouldn't be on

1005
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,700
identity um yeah I think maybe one point

1006
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,920
the mic down I was trying that it's a

1007
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,280
little tight

1008
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,020
I don't want to break it

1009
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,960
all right um anyway Monty Wiseman

1010
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,300
um know a little bit about the TPM and

1011
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,339
I've seen lots of for example TPM

1012
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:43,740
implications which this would be among

1013
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,480
the type of items

1014
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,819
you would you would apply to this

1015
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:50,040
I you know looking through it I think in

1016
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,079
maybe the previous uh speaker's

1017
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,940
suggestion needs to be looked at

1018
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,339
just a simple binary of Hardware versus

1019
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,020
software I think it's going to be very

1020
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,720
difficult for people

1021
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,460
to ascertain or make a decision on

1022
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,260
there's lots of implementations

1023
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,560
uh isn't as hard to remain a separate IP

1024
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,079
block inside the chip a separate ship

1025
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,760
itself

1026
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,280
um anyway so there's I think I think

1027
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,020
there's going to be lots of variability

1028
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,520
people are going to want to set the

1029
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,700
hardware bit what sort of criteria do we

1030
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,980
have for Hardware bit we've got like

1031
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,540
things with normal world and secure

1032
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,040
world for example

1033
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,260
uh things over in Secure world is that

1034
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,420
Hardware it's the same piece of silicon

1035
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,380
that's actually executing the

1036
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,240
instructions as the normal world

1037
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,640
so I think this is going to be a a

1038
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,099
challenge to Simply make it a binary

1039
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,020
decision

1040
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,380
um secondarily go ahead go ahead oh no I

1041
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,060
agree with what you're saying and even

1042
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,220
within just you know the Android format

1043
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,720
you see a lot of variability there

1044
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,819
there's strong box there's T I think

1045
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:52,440
there's even attestations that indicate

1046
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,240
software

1047
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,040
um you know that as as with what I said

1048
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,099
to Stefan that exists we're not creating

1049
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,740
that condition we're just providing a

1050
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,900
means to convey this information to the

1051
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,000
ca to appraise however it wants to

1052
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,160
appraise and and I think that's kind of

1053
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,319
what you're getting at is is the

1054
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,240
appraisal process some folks are going

1055
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,800
to do it different than others and that

1056
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,520
seems okay to me

1057
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,599
well I I think you're gonna have a child

1058
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:21,599
you the appraiser is going to need more

1059
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,579
information than just a bit

1060
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:26,280
to make this determination is is what is

1061
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,260
what I'm saying and just having a simple

1062
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,599
bit I I'm afraid is going to be overused

1063
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,220
and then become well there's not there's

1064
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,960
not a bit there's there's a statement

1065
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,060
format and that that format definition

1066
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,460
is referenced in the registry

1067
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,380
so there's lots of words written about

1068
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,540
all of these formats right

1069
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,940
yeah I understand that in in the

1070
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,440
attestation statement you can provide

1071
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,839
more clarity but then what's the point

1072
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:51,000
of just having this bit

1073
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,859
I guess I'm not sure what bit you're

1074
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:54,420
you're referring to yeah actually

1075
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,579
there's a there's a binary value right

1076
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:00,020
before the attestation statement

1077
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,819
let me pull that out that's the one I'm

1078
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:07,560
I'm questioning

1079
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,540
and and maybe that's something that that

1080
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,720
we we should look at now now that I get

1081
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,460
what you're saying okay can we just take

1082
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,280
that on the mailing list

1083
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,920
yeah I'll I'll post

1084
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,680
um okay yeah I've gotta have you thought

1085
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,980
about adding something like this key has

1086
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,800
certain attributes such as policies

1087
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,540
associated with using the keys would

1088
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,760
that be out of scope for this particular

1089
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,920
extension maybe it's another I think

1090
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,200
that's part of the attestation statement

1091
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,760
format and to reference Android

1092
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,980
catastrations again there's all kinds of

1093
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,720
stuff like that that appears in an

1094
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,420
Android catastation the usage the

1095
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,040
algorithms that kind of stuff that's all

1096
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,880
there

1097
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,859
all right I'll dig deeper into that

1098
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:52,200
thank you

1099
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,460
okay

1100
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,900
hello

1101
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,160
Sean again

1102
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,740
um it's funny actually the uh I thought

1103
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,359
we thought about many of these things

1104
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,700
and was like okay well what's gonna work

1105
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,020
um the funny thing is can you go back to

1106
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,000
slides where it's like why and the list

1107
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,460
of all the various enrollment protocols

1108
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,800
yeah back one where it's just like why

1109
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,940
because there's so many of them because

1110
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,579
we could never actually picked one

1111
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:16,260
um my biggest worry was that we were

1112
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,720
going to actually refer to scep in uh

1113
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,000
normative format I'd have to downref it

1114
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,200
which would put it on the standards

1115
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,819
track so I just want to throw that out

1116
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:25,619
there that you know for the ads that are

1117
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,359
later going to be passing this to the

1118
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,280
thing everything else up there seems to

1119
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,500
be great but SCP is the really weird one

1120
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,480
on the on the list of things to do so

1121
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,059
just kind of remember that and it's a

1122
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:37,740
because again we're just defining this

1123
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,480
format thing that you can put in any one

1124
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,980
of these enrollment protocols and

1125
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,940
there's

1126
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,740
five or six up there and there'll be

1127
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,960
more later so just make sure it's an

1128
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,300
informational reference yeah well

1129
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,059
whatever we'll figure that out

1130
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:53,460
the issue with scap is it's it's the

1131
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,040
payload format that's in apples

1132
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,440
over-the-air profile configuration

1133
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,079
delivery protocol so that's a whole lot

1134
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,420
of devices that are doing scap

1135
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,079
yep

1136
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,020
all right um so

1137
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:10,619
um

1138
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:12,839
I think it's worth noting that even

1139
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:16,020
though we're both attestation is widely

1140
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,400
available

1141
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,040
and you know in in some sense extremely

1142
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,800
widely deployed it there is not a huge

1143
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,420
amount of deployment experience for

1144
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,700
relying parties actually processing

1145
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,500
uh we're both attestation and doing

1146
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,420
anything with it

1147
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,520
um and in that respect

1148
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,559
um the stuff that Stefan talked about

1149
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,200
the qualified certificate extension is

1150
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,940
in a sense a little bit more mature in

1151
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,640
the sense that the in the it essentially

1152
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,960
references a a big Speck of Behavioral

1153
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,880
Behavior or

1154
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,220
um requirements that's what qualified

1155
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,720
certificate to it's a sort of a

1156
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,819
federation specification

1157
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:57,059
and whereas the Web auth format is you

1158
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:01,020
know a set of values right a set of bits

1159
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,440
or Flags or whatnot and in experience

1160
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,020
from other large scale deployments of

1161
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,000
these kinds of sort of Behavioral

1162
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,020
requirements over time it tends to be

1163
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,300
very very hard for a lying parties to

1164
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,440
process

1165
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,040
like large catalogs or values

1166
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,920
um I would refer you to nest's work on

1167
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,680
this in 863 where they've gone back and

1168
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,079
forth between

1169
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:29,280
requiring you know simple levels of

1170
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,559
assurance uh the classical one through

1171
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:33,480
four level of assurance too

1172
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,220
things that have a little bit more

1173
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,260
parameter space in them in these vectors

1174
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,940
of trust stuff that they have been using

1175
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,540
for the last two years so it even though

1176
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,059
it may be very attractive to reference

1177
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:46,619
the where both

1178
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:47,760
um

1179
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,760
format here as in a registry

1180
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,660
I would take a little bit more more look

1181
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,359
at what's been used in the digital

1182
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,480
identity industry for for well I want to

1183
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,520
say decades here but almost well it's

1184
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,079
more more than a decade

1185
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,700
in this space

1186
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:10,800
and think about how to how to do this

1187
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,660
um

1188
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,220
these are like non-trivial things

1189
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,380
although I agree that if you want to do

1190
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,079
a catalog of a bit

1191
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,300
um where both is probably as good a

1192
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,400
starting point is oh well a couple

1193
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,980
points on this one the Kiara station

1194
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,319
format that I have in mind aren't that

1195
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,240
old right they're not decades old

1196
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,800
they're you know half a dozen years

1197
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,619
older so I know

1198
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:35,520
my point

1199
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,400
well I mean I don't get to tell someone

1200
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,099
what what attestation format to use I I

1201
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:42,900
have to consume it as a relying party

1202
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,720
right so and that's all this is doing is

1203
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,059
saying these different products they all

1204
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,700
have different attestation formats I'd

1205
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,680
like a way for my CA to get a hold of

1206
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,420
them so this is really just a bucket to

1207
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,099
carry something from point A to point B

1208
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:59,700
I'm personally not wed to web authen I

1209
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,900
don't care if we were to go with just

1210
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,300
oids that's what I did before in a

1211
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,960
proprietary implementation but if Acme

1212
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,880
is going to do web often it just makes

1213
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,280
sense to me that we make it easier and

1214
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,720
use the same format for these other

1215
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,040
protocols

1216
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,260
I I agree I'm just saying maybe not

1217
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,180
limit yourselves to that particular

1218
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,420
format because there will be other

1219
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,160
reasons to process attestation that will

1220
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,920
have very very different formats

1221
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,260
or perhaps if you're around Give a

1222
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,200
listen tomorrow and I I would like and

1223
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,599
it's not imperative that I would like if

1224
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,059
if these two specs were at the end of

1225
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,780
the day harmonized so and I think that

1226
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,760
that one's going to be web often so

1227
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,819
thank you yeah I mean absolutely I think

1228
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:49,380
one of them will certainly be aware of

1229
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,180
them right I think don't think it will

1230
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,339
be the only one I think that's I think

1231
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,319
Stefan's point

1232
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:58,920
oh you're saying why Define just an oid

1233
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,140
for web often and and instead Define

1234
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,619
another bucket type to carry this stuff

1235
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:06,660
or maybe something that can Encompass

1236
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,240
where both end and other things

1237
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,760
in some situations it is oids right in

1238
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,900
other situations it's going to be

1239
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,119
something like an Loa or a vector of

1240
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,800
trust thing right another situation is

1241
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,200
just going to be like hey I'm it's a bit

1242
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,599
I'm a qualified certificate I I my key

1243
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,579
has been generated using a

1244
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:26,579
a QC capable device right so it's a

1245
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,500
range of things and I agree with you

1246
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,240
relying parties never never going to

1247
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,380
dictate this

1248
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,720
but yeah it's going to be more complex

1249
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,020
than just the weapon even though

1250
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,579
if you two have something that's

1251
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:41,099
concrete that exists in mind if you

1252
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:42,780
could send a pointer to it so that I

1253
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,700
don't grope around and not find the

1254
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,819
right thing that would be helpful I'll

1255
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:50,760
give you I mean Steph I'll I'll find you

1256
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,319
all fine right but Stefan gave you one

1257
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,300
right and there are multiple of these

1258
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,900
sort of ways to specify some sort of

1259
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,579
property of the the thing generating the

1260
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:01,079
private key or the authentication

1261
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,020
context he gave me some terms with which

1262
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,119
I could search but not a specific

1263
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:08,579
reference of what what does this already

1264
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,559
that's what I'm asking for

1265
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,480
yeah well the qualified certificates is

1266
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,339
one thing and you can search for that

1267
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:16,079
and the vectors of trust is another

1268
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,300
that's another way of specifying sort of

1269
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,400
assurance for

1270
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,339
uh authentication context and the NIS

1271
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:28,920
800-63 is another one right the these

1272
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,160
are these look very very different right

1273
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,559
um we're both in attestation was I think

1274
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,839
an attempt to build something quite

1275
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,280
simple

1276
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,819
but you can go back to even to Kerberos

1277
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,940
days and you will find people have been

1278
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,240
trying to specify sort of the quality of

1279
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,520
of the authentication context is

1280
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,339
something or something it was a Kerberos

1281
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:54,960
um PK in it

1282
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,540
um was it done using a hardware context

1283
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,760
or not right that it's been tried right

1284
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,740
and

1285
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,760
specifying these kind that kind of

1286
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,900
policy

1287
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,839
is um everybody has their own idea the

1288
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:08,579
web of them people have their specific

1289
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,660
idea on how to do this

1290
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:14,520
um there's nothing in this draft that

1291
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,319
would prevent another draft from

1292
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,240
referencing such things I mean all of

1293
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,640
this stuff already exists right and and

1294
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,160
picking winners and losers I don't know

1295
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,140
we can take that on on the list that's

1296
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,420
fine I think I get what you're after uh

1297
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,339
yeah I'm arguing against picking trying

1298
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:31,020
to pick winners

1299
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,440
Michael

1300
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,500
so

1301
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,980
um Michael Richardson here so I read the

1302
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,760
draft

1303
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,160
um and I know I think I asked the list

1304
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,859
why it was very what was the rat's

1305
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:48,960
connection at one point

1306
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,400
um

1307
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,780
um having listened to the presentation

1308
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:55,020
now I have a much better idea that it's

1309
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,180
a cross type of thing

1310
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,420
and I guess I want to know is um

1311
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,059
as lamps want to fight for this rats for

1312
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:06,480
this draft or does neither want it or

1313
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,640
um because it kind of will just it kind

1314
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,339
of seems to to go a little bit you know

1315
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:13,980
lamps as for the syntax and racks as for

1316
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,780
the semantics

1317
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,700
I don't know so right now there are two

1318
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,920
drafts that that I've talked about this

1319
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,140
week the one in rats was for defining a

1320
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,299
structure for Distributing trust anchors

1321
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:26,700
which could be used I know this context

1322
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,059
right oh yes and then here there's no

1323
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,220
rats in this draft you know this isn't

1324
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,960
using eats

1325
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,880
no I know that that wasn't the question

1326
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,079
but you're still talking about

1327
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:39,359
attestations through the type of key

1328
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,140
that was was created right and so so the

1329
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,059
the fact that we're creating it doing

1330
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:46,799
putting something a certificate is what

1331
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,260
Yanks it into this working group the

1332
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,319
fact that we're we're talking about some

1333
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,579
um uh quality about the private key okay

1334
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:58,920
and who created it and how and in what

1335
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,900
circumstances is what Yanks it back in

1336
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,720
the other direction except the uh Carl's

1337
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,359
already pointing to

1338
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,559
attestation formats that are already

1339
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:10,020
defined already defined okay so I just I

1340
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,760
just wanted to ask that higher level

1341
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,400
question here because we you know we've

1342
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,559
got it if you need to define a new one I

1343
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:17,880
agree with you it probably goes there

1344
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,260
okay

1345
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,420
actually if you were to Define one for

1346
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,099
eats I would think that you would Define

1347
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,859
a web authen uh statement format that

1348
00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:28,319
would wrap the eat and and I mean really

1349
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,000
at the end of the day all we're using

1350
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,940
web authen for is format agility

1351
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,400
that's it and the reason that's being

1352
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,079
used is because there are some large

1353
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:41,119
vendors that emit this already

1354
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,160
Stefan go ahead

1355
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,780
does it work now no yeah so I just want

1356
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,359
to get you aware that I provided a link

1357
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,780
in the jabber chat to uh to the Etsy

1358
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,640
work

1359
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,359
okay thanks

1360
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:14,960
okay

1361
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,740
thank you Carl

1362
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,260
ready

1363
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,000
I think it's Sean gonna talk about so

1364
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,920
should we do a whole who read it can we

1365
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,420
adopt it like that was kind of the point

1366
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,559
right

1367
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:33,900
so I don't know if we want to oh thank

1368
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,220
you

1369
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,619
is there anyone uh stay there you're not

1370
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:39,420
or come up here

1371
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,660
um you're next

1372
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,780
does anyone object to uh this group

1373
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,119
adopting this document or does it need

1374
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:49,980
further work before we have asked that

1375
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,220
question

1376
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,220
no one's thinking it shouldn't be I

1377
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:00,078
don't see anyone saying anything online

1378
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:10,859
okay so we'll we'll uh take it to the

1379
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:12,720
mail list

1380
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,940
and yeah for all those new people that

1381
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,380
haven't come to the IHF a lot that's

1382
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,700
what you want is you want to ask at the

1383
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,780
end like what are we doing with it

1384
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,400
because otherwise even leaving this kind

1385
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,720
of I don't know what the hell's going on

1386
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,559
State

1387
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,520
and that's not cool

1388
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:27,359
sometimes you get shot down in flames

1389
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,040
sometimes you don't so tacos

1390
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,280
so hey this is another one slide

1391
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,380
presentation this is the uh draft that

1392
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,760
we talked about last time which is an

1393
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,619
individual submission still it's about

1394
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,240
PQ

1395
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,799
um Kim certs it was going to specify

1396
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:45,480
it's going to be the one that ruled them

1397
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,040
all right it was gonna how are you gonna

1398
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,960
put these uh

1399
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,540
chems the public keys and certificates

1400
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,980
and what are we going to do we're going

1401
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,660
to have this long list of choices and

1402
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:58,440
then this picked one so next

1403
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,859
yes

1404
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,680
no there's a terminology draft that this

1405
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,118
this woman back here is going to write

1406
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,780
[Laughter]

1407
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,420
yeah

1408
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,740
exactly because I'm not a cryptographer

1409
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,960
so I'm just throwing it out there right

1410
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,579
um again the strap was going to like

1411
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:22,200
specify them all and they just picked

1412
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,180
one so hey that's nice this draft is

1413
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,460
going to be really short here's we're

1414
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,839
gonna we're gonna link it down and make

1415
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,640
it just be one it's going to specify

1416
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,440
what the public key is we are not

1417
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,940
specifying the oid we're going to take

1418
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,859
it from nist whatever that is we're

1419
00:59:34,859 --> 00:59:36,900
going to say no parameters you're gonna

1420
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,880
have an oid and then they've got three

1421
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,619
options for like

1422
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,480
low medium high or whatever they're

1423
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,900
going to call it or you know when uh 128

1424
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,240
to 24 and 56 or whatever it is we're

1425
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,619
going to take those names we're going to

1426
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,359
go with it and that's it

1427
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:52,859
um but it's the encoding of the

1428
00:59:52,859 --> 00:59:54,480
algorithm identifier where it's like an

1429
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,940
oid and parameters we are not talking

1430
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,700
about parameters no parameters

1431
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,140
I don't know how many ways it's going to

1432
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:01,980
be

1433
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,740
there's I think it's I

1434
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,480
so I talk with password and press

1435
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,819
parameters equals 108. when I talk about

1436
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:10,200
panels I hope there was only going to be

1437
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,520
like

1438
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:16,980
uh like use and uh like paranoid and

1439
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,859
then we can just ignore the alien level

1440
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:21,540
um you know security but I don't know

1441
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,980
what's gonna happen and again whatever

1442
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,720
they specify we're gonna do it the

1443
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,579
problem is that people will just like go

1444
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:28,920
for the super high level and no you

1445
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,180
don't really need that stuff at this

1446
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,859
point so we'll do whatever they whatever

1447
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:34,339
they specify there'll be a number of uh

1448
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,440
we won't specify any parameters now a

1449
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,760
lot of us is like super back history

1450
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,520
rates like 1997 when people screwed up

1451
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,680
their implementations and required

1452
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,359
parameters we're trying to just drop

1453
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,460
that baggage so it's like just don't

1454
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,079
encode the damn things so it's

1455
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,000
Greenfield we're hoping we can get away

1456
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,280
with that and then of course you got to

1457
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,140
specify what the key scissors are well

1458
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,119
it's a chem pretty straightforward what

1459
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,280
the choices are going to be right

1460
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,740
so there shouldn't be any real kind of

1461
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,599
argument about this

1462
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:04,740
um and then we have some security

1463
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,839
considerations the one part we will have

1464
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:08,400
a discussion I guess is the private key

1465
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,140
part which I think somebody's talking

1466
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,460
about later

1467
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,559
well I'm the first PQ one everybody gets

1468
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:14,180
in line

1469
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,859
[Laughter]

1470
01:01:16,859 --> 01:01:19,740
fresh meat all right go ahead yeah so

1471
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:23,339
you don't this seems very connected to

1472
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:26,040
the next presentation about signatures

1473
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,020
but a little bit different but that

1474
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,480
presentation said nist will do this for

1475
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,940
us though you say at least we'll do this

1476
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,160
and then we will take whatever needs why

1477
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,140
these

1478
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,819
specify the other presentation also have

1479
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:42,000
a lot of discussion what does the oid

1480
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,220
mean do we have one and then encode

1481
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,079
everything in the public key value like

1482
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,839
with LNF LMS and RSA or do we have

1483
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:51,720
several where these four different

1484
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,599
security levels how I think they'll be

1485
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:56,640
annoyed per security level and that

1486
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,200
that's going to be the only parameters

1487
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,240
pick the right away yeah and that's it

1488
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,280
otherwise we're going to be in like a

1489
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,619
world of hurt

1490
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:07,020
who is going to decide that is are we

1491
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,119
going to take what this decides or will

1492
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,480
doesnis want our input on on this so I

1493
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,940
think I think I think both but at the

1494
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,140
end of the day I think that they've

1495
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,460
decided the way they came out the

1496
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,079
signature stuff they kind of like picked

1497
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:20,819
uh you know three levels essentially

1498
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:23,160
right whether it's two or four or three

1499
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,380
whatever levels are we're just gonna if

1500
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,579
it's three we're just gonna go with

1501
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:27,960
those and go with the flow we're not

1502
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,880
trying to we're not trying to usurp

1503
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,339
nists you know like let's go write a

1504
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:34,079
special publication or fips or whatever

1505
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,020
that's clearly not the intention if this

1506
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,599
draft is long it's because the key sizes

1507
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,160
are huge and the examples that I would

1508
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,680
like

1509
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,879
make it longer and that's it

1510
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,740
as the broken record and what's in the

1511
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,539
charter the charter says we take what's

1512
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:53,700
from this and not reinvest yeah so yeah

1513
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,500
this is definitely a again this like

1514
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,660
this and then the next the signature

1515
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,359
stuff like we're not trying to

1516
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,859
do more than we really should because

1517
01:03:01,859 --> 01:03:03,480
it's not really I mean my personal

1518
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,440
opinion it's not our place

1519
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:09,299
um Sphinx aside we're talking about yeah

1520
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:11,400
like three to five parameters oh it's

1521
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,920
not you know dozens

1522
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,359
um the comment that I got up to make is

1523
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:18,480
I will pick at you about key usage not

1524
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,819
being straightforward just for the

1525
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:22,319
record like chems are a different

1526
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,359
interface so they're not a key Trend and

1527
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:25,559
they're not a key agree there's

1528
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:27,839
something new we don't want to make a

1529
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:31,079
new EKU or KU because gross

1530
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:33,299
probably we I mean

1531
01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:35,220
key trends are key agree both are wrong

1532
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,660
I think as long as we all pick one we

1533
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,339
all pick one consistently it's okay but

1534
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:40,200
just don't gloss over that there is yeah

1535
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,059
I did want to make the point that you

1536
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:43,619
and I and the other authors of your

1537
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,059
draft have talked and we want to be in

1538
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:46,500
complete agreement so that there's not

1539
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,240
going to be a fight over like what's the

1540
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,520
bit and I think we decided on key trans

1541
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,500
and not key agreement and we were kind

1542
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,059
of like well we got to pick one so

1543
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,440
yeah whatever it was we agreed to that's

1544
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,420
in the draft I think is what we're going

1545
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,859
to do because we don't want to set up

1546
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:03,240
this fight where you know the

1547
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,859
quote-unquote composite one whatever

1548
01:04:04,859 --> 01:04:06,059
that means because we're going to get

1549
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:08,280
that terminology defined later we're

1550
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,319
just gonna go with the flow

1551
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:13,020
but it's just a little trivia um if you

1552
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,819
start if if you have to name things

1553
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:17,460
anywhere like in the Ayana registry or

1554
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,160
or having a shorthand uh please don't

1555
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,500
name anything with a dash in there or a

1556
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,299
space because there are still some

1557
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:26,520
dinosaurs that code in the sea and we

1558
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,559
would really like to map the names one

1559
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,039
on one and so at least use underscores

1560
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:34,380
ah interesting okay well that'll be nice

1561
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,839
input to miss but yeah cool we won't we

1562
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:38,640
won't we won't bother with that

1563
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,280
description

1564
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,619
uh underscores not printable string

1565
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:44,900
yeah

1566
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,920
I'll just skip it and just put the

1567
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,599
number the size of the security

1568
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:52,140
strengths right after it yeah

1569
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,599
yeah let the seat programmers translate

1570
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:57,180
dashed underscore but

1571
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,859
it worked in openssl so it works

1572
01:04:58,859 --> 01:04:59,760
everywhere

1573
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,980
um

1574
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,090
[Music]

1575
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:05,700
yeah

1576
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,280
um do you actually really needs multiple

1577
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,140
oids or can you just determine what the

1578
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,760
key is from the link that's encoded in

1579
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,220
the search no I think people I think

1580
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,079
people like as you can tell by the

1581
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,819
grones I think people like the explicit

1582
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:20,039
like here's what the strength value of

1583
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,079
the strength is so that's the only way

1584
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,299
that's why yeah but we don't know if

1585
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:27,119
there will be multiple parameter sets we

1586
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,920
hope they're not but we don't know that

1587
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,780
there never will be okay

1588
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:32,839
so

1589
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:35,039
I can't remember if I have another draft

1590
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,680
another slide or not I don't think I do

1591
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,000
I I hope not

1592
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,380
um we didn't do the question okay cool

1593
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,059
that was my that would be the next slide

1594
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:46,680
again remember people never been here

1595
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,599
before ask for adoption so that would be

1596
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:50,819
it so

1597
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:53,280
so anyone think we should not adopt this

1598
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,819
document or should have a call to adopt

1599
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,058
the stock

1600
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,819
not seeing anyone opposed is there

1601
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:05,039
anyone in chat no

1602
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,599
okay

1603
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,740
so uh

1604
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,160
Mike Ellsworth so I'll make an Omnibus

1605
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,900
comment for I think all the PQ stuff

1606
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,160
which is

1607
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,640
could we like adopt it start getting the

1608
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,039
administrative work the text editing the

1609
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:24,299
sort of General design out of the way

1610
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:26,039
and then like as a group just sort of

1611
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:27,900
pause them and wait for nist and that

1612
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,160
way we can synchronize across working

1613
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,720
group that's exactly what we're doing

1614
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,059
yeah exactly correct right we're not

1615
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:34,440
trying to get out in front of our skis

1616
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,299
to like fail miserably right here it's

1617
01:06:36,299 --> 01:06:38,880
like we specify some stuff I'm gonna put

1618
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,220
tbds in the oil in the in the play I'm

1619
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,660
not trying to squat on anything like

1620
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:45,299
we're just if people want to experiment

1621
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:47,400
they can they can do what they want we

1622
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,599
just won't put the numbers in there so

1623
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:49,619
that we're not

1624
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:51,059
because the reason why we want to do

1625
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:52,140
that is because later we don't want

1626
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:55,020
somebody to be like no we're not going

1627
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:56,460
to change your implementation because

1628
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,200
that's happened in the past and we don't

1629
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,599
want to play that game anymore yep and

1630
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,160
also to be clear I mean you know this is

1631
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,380
nist time library right here we've got a

1632
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,359
whole bunch of drafts we want to make

1633
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:08,220
sure that we get them all done as close

1634
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,720
to the left side of that timeline as

1635
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,460
possible otherwise we'll fall off the

1636
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,440
right side so you know would rather

1637
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,539
hurry up and wait than uh miss the

1638
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:17,839
deadline

1639
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:26,119
is Jake here yeah there he is thank you

1640
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,799
I'm just waiting for the control of the

1641
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,720
slides there we go

1642
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,780
all right past applied control to you

1643
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,280
thank you very much can you guys hear me

1644
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,900
okay

1645
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,339
yep

1646
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:40,799
wonderful uh yeah so I guess for those

1647
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,140
who don't know me uh Jake Massimo I am

1648
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,480
at AWS

1649
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,240
um I did a PhD in cryptography under uh

1650
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,539
Kenny Patterson WTH uh so yeah today I'm

1651
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:53,880
going to talk about uh similar drafts as

1652
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,140
the one previous

1653
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:58,740
um algorithms identifiers for x509 this

1654
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,900
is the signature version of the

1655
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,960
algorithms rather than the cameras

1656
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,099
here and just get through the slide

1657
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:09,780
you should see some buttons at the

1658
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,299
bottom yeah got it so a little bit of

1659
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:13,500
motivation

1660
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,299
um so what what is this about so yeah as

1661
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,380
I said before the inclusion of the

1662
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,140
algorithms selected by nist's pqc

1663
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:22,439
project into x509 right now the draft is

1664
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:25,500
focusing on dilithium as Nestor stated

1665
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,359
it as the primary algorithm to be

1666
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,460
implemented and of course it has you

1667
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,779
know a reasonable wild balance

1668
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:33,479
performance uh throughout

1669
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:35,520
uh we're aiming here at the description

1670
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,738
of uh the pure

1671
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,080
um certificate so we're not focusing on

1672
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,799
the uh hybrid or non-composite um

1673
01:08:43,799 --> 01:08:46,620
I guess actually composite certificates

1674
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,960
um but of course this draft may come in

1675
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,719
use for the hybrid work as well

1676
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:52,859
um so you can kind of think of this as

1677
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:54,259
an RFC

1678
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:58,439
3279 for lists signature algorithms and

1679
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:00,719
the ID provides the conventions and the

1680
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,859
Syntax for putting the active

1681
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:04,198
identifiers parameters into the

1682
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:06,060
certificates

1683
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,640
uh why now uh just a little bit more

1684
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,738
motivation uh so we are seeing some

1685
01:09:10,738 --> 01:09:13,500
industry interest uh scoping out

1686
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,658
um recipients with PQ resistance these

1687
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:17,520
are kind of applicable in the the long

1688
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,520
term uh rule of trusts so things are

1689
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,920
embedded uh within devices or things

1690
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,020
that are difficult to reissue

1691
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,880
um we're starting to get some some like

1692
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,100
custom questions and some like uh

1693
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,799
examples from automotive industry having

1694
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:34,979
machinery and iot devices that may sit

1695
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,020
on a shelf for a long time before

1696
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,479
they're ever switched on and then a look

1697
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:40,859
to update

1698
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:43,679
uh of course this has announced the uh

1699
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,420
the algorithms for adoption uh don't

1700
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,279
listen Falcon

1701
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,439
um this will take some time but uh yes

1702
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,479
nice nice to people this process uh now

1703
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:52,799
that we have some

1704
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:56,280
um algorithms selected and uh as I've

1705
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,020
heard mentioned previously it kind of

1706
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,760
aligns with our the line to Charter to

1707
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,780
adopt

1708
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,659
um a draft for pqc signatures in pkix

1709
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:05,400
certificates

1710
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,659
um as was I think literally just

1711
01:10:06,659 --> 01:10:07,739
mentioned

1712
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:10,140
um with with the TLs 1.3 draft Our

1713
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:11,880
intention is for this to be ratified

1714
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,040
after 2024

1715
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,600
um what's you know this is fully

1716
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,440
finished specifying and describing

1717
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,239
the algorithm isn't standardizing the

1718
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:23,718
algorithms

1719
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,600
slide yeah so our goals and our

1720
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,940
non-goals we kind of already focused or

1721
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:32,280
gone over this before uh so we will um

1722
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,719
our guys are to define the data

1723
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:35,820
structures for the use of dilithium

1724
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:38,820
signatures in next 509 and we want a

1725
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,820
clean and concise specification so yeah

1726
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,679
no parameters we will just have them

1727
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:47,040
hard coded in the oids and our non-goals

1728
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,980
are yeah we won't be we won't be uh

1729
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:52,020
trying to overthrow nist and say which

1730
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,340
algorithms to use we'll be going with

1731
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:57,060
nests selection and with nists selection

1732
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,820
of oids

1733
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,880
so just to finish up a couple of uh key

1734
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,440
discussion points obviously for

1735
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,060
signatures there are multiple algorithms

1736
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,679
that have been selected

1737
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,080
um so we kind of have this uh you know

1738
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,840
the the one the one ID uh to rule them

1739
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,560
all or do we separate the uh each draft

1740
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,260
or algorithm per draft

1741
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,000
um of course multiple algorithms in a

1742
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,040
single draft can kind of bloat some

1743
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,780
security considerations you know you

1744
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,239
could imagine talking about the detailed

1745
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:30,960
intricacies of lattices and then also

1746
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,420
you know hash functions and it could be

1747
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,340
confusing as to you know which security

1748
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,800
consideration is talking about which

1749
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,659
um algorithm for people that are you

1750
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:41,460
know less familiar with them

1751
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,659
um so right now we're kind of thinking

1752
01:11:42,659 --> 01:11:46,860
one one algorithm per per draft and uh

1753
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,360
yeah another question is you know which

1754
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,760
security levels should we include all of

1755
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,719
them

1756
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:53,460
um a selection of them again we'll be

1757
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:54,900
looking to Nest

1758
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,280
um to see what they kind of put out

1759
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,199
there first and then

1760
01:11:58,199 --> 01:12:01,199
being sensible about our choices

1761
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,580
um we'd also love to hear your feedback

1762
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,440
I have introduced the draft on the

1763
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,460
mailing list and there's been some

1764
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,800
discussion on there already

1765
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,580
um about uh

1766
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,460
bit strings versus octet strings and

1767
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,620
things like this uh but yeah we'd love

1768
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:19,260
to hear from your feedback and I guess I

1769
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,420
have to make the uh

1770
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,719
the the call to add this as a working

1771
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,400
group item

1772
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,699
so thank you very much for listening

1773
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:31,860
foreign

1774
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,920
yeah hi it's John Gray from entrust yeah

1775
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,300
I think I'm the one that probably made

1776
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,739
those comments on the bit strings and

1777
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:39,480
then on the draft but yeah I very much

1778
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,820
support this I think I was saying on the

1779
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:43,679
mailing list we have already done

1780
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,780
Integrations with customers and I've

1781
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,760
already had to change my oids three

1782
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,380
times obviously we know that they're

1783
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,420
going to change but it would be great to

1784
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,340
have you know a final set that we can

1785
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,900
use especially now that nist has

1786
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,300
announced so the sooner we can get those

1787
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,699
that just less work for us and better

1788
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:02,460
Integrations with the different partners

1789
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,320
that are actually looking to do this and

1790
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,120
I mean we've been doing this for the

1791
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,980
past couple years already so there's

1792
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,239
definitely

1793
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:10,980
um yeah a lot of people interested in

1794
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:13,679
that so thank you

1795
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,940
yeah thank you for your feedback as well

1796
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:20,280
John Mattson obviously this is needed

1797
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,800
work we need to integrate everything in

1798
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,100
this standard I think for lamps probably

1799
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,380
we should do everything that needs

1800
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:31,320
decides to stand that dice I think it's

1801
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,560
hard to know what will be be used in the

1802
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,380
future coming back to this oid it was

1803
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,380
only two years ago that lamps

1804
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:42,080
standardizes LMS

1805
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,340
741yd for all security levels are we

1806
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,199
already

1807
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:50,940
agreeing that that was a bad choice or

1808
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,580
is there any differences between the

1809
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,739
algorithm that motivates now everybody

1810
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,300
seems to say that we should have one

1811
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,640
already per security level I don't have

1812
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,800
any problems so

1813
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,739
um let me answer that the difference was

1814
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:06,420
the way the algorithm of spec was

1815
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,320
written

1816
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:13,259
the algorithm spec used the

1817
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:19,020
RPC encoding of the parameters into the

1818
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,659
key itself so you only needed one

1819
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:24,360
because the key embedded all the

1820
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,679
parameters

1821
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,199
and so

1822
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,300
if missed were to take that approach

1823
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,239
then we would only need one but

1824
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:36,000
it seems based on the way the algorithm

1825
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,960
specs that they asked for in the

1826
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,560
competition are not that way so that

1827
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,600
would be a big change to the way they're

1828
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,360
specifying it and that's why okay

1829
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,540
um or or steel transmute apologies for

1830
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:00,060
not queuing technical difficulties

1831
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,280
um I appreciate all the comments you

1832
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,679
know so I appreciate all the comments

1833
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:07,500
and um support this uh proposal working

1834
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,840
on the Cozy and Hosey representations to

1835
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,699
mirror what you're all working on here

1836
01:15:11,699 --> 01:15:13,500
and I'm looking forward to collaborating

1837
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,900
keeping everything in sync

1838
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,620
thank you

1839
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,140
okay so this gets us to the is this the

1840
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,400
right approach

1841
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,300
um

1842
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,690
it seems that we have

1843
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:30,840
[Music]

1844
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,420
some choices on this slide that I think

1845
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:37,620
need a little fleshed out in in do we

1846
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,380
want one

1847
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:45,719
uh PQ signature draft that has all three

1848
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:49,940
of the finalists in it or winners in it

1849
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:55,199
or do we want one draft per algorithm I

1850
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,880
think

1851
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,940
it's really important to in order to

1852
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,440
know how to structure the call for

1853
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,860
adoption

1854
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:11,780
take a poll okay we can do that

1855
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,159
get in the queue here if I press the

1856
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:19,199
button here so I used to hi this is Sean

1857
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,699
Turner I used to be in the camp for like

1858
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:23,159
one draft to roll them all and I've kind

1859
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:24,360
of been slayed over to the other side

1860
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,640
where it's like just have one draft per

1861
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,920
per algorithm because at the end of the

1862
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,900
day drafts are cheap these keys are big

1863
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,699
literally

1864
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:34,500
um so let's just keep them separate and

1865
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,940
I think implementers that really care

1866
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,560
don't want to Wade through all the other

1867
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,480
crap right so if they're picking one

1868
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,400
they just want to go with one and again

1869
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,440
it's just it's okay to we're not saying

1870
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,540
like this is the one this is the one

1871
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,159
we're starting with if we're going to do

1872
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:48,900
the other two great we'll do those two

1873
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,239
so I kind of like the idea of keeping

1874
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:53,699
one and it does kind of like you know

1875
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:55,739
I'm not the cryptographer where you know

1876
01:16:55,739 --> 01:16:57,659
Jake is and he's like well I want to

1877
01:16:57,659 --> 01:16:58,679
write 30 pages of security

1878
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:00,060
considerations about this particular

1879
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,980
thing it's better to just keep it all

1880
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:03,179
together because it's like then you've

1881
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:04,860
got a I don't know I think it's just

1882
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:06,420
going to be easier for people to get

1883
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,280
easier very smart people read these

1884
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,719
drafts and Implement them but at the end

1885
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:10,739
of the day

1886
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:12,239
um I think it just it'll be conceptually

1887
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,500
a little easier to have them separate

1888
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,840
yeah sorry I had technical difficulties

1889
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,340
with the queue I was just going to say

1890
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:23,040
this test called for a round four for

1891
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,600
signatures as well so if you put all

1892
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,400
three of them in one then there's going

1893
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,780
to be you know another one that comes

1894
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:28,739
out and then you'll have to do a

1895
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:30,900
separate draft anyway so you might as

1896
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:34,219
well just keep them separate I think

1897
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:37,880
from transmute

1898
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,920
agree and separating them in the Cozy

1899
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,780
and Hosey drafts that we've been

1900
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:43,980
developing we have them all together

1901
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:46,260
because it's easy at the beginning that

1902
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:48,300
way but I think for a number of reasons

1903
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,679
that have been mentioned all of which I

1904
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,239
agree it would be good to split them up

1905
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:52,739
particularly because of the call for

1906
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:56,599
additional algorithms from nist

1907
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,460
Roman

1908
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,560
hi Roman I just wanted to be uh I wanted

1909
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,260
to be last so personal opinion I think

1910
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,640
we should split them into separate

1911
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,219
drafts you know 80 hat on I'll support

1912
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:11,940
what what the consensus is

1913
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:14,460
okay so I started a poll

1914
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,080
um should we put each signature

1915
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,920
algorithm in its own document

1916
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,820
um I I will I will observe that if nist

1917
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:27,300
publishes them at the same time we don't

1918
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,659
care if this staggers publication this

1919
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:32,219
aligns

1920
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:34,400
foreign

1921
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:41,849
[Laughter]

1922
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:49,380
okay 41-1

1923
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,490
if the one person

1924
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:52,980
[Music]

1925
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,980
um

1926
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,759
it's pretty

1927
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,620
if that one person would like to speak

1928
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,480
and try and change the other's minds

1929
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,320
you're welcome

1930
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:11,120
tell us your opinion yes

1931
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,400
okay he had 11. so

1932
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,920
um does anyone object to doing a call

1933
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,800
for adoption for the

1934
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:20,820
um

1935
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:24,860
the lithium signature

1936
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:28,440
which is the one we have a draft for

1937
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,339
okay thank you

1938
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:48,199
um

1939
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,260
Michael

1940
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:04,340
is uh

1941
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,000
can I mess up come on

1942
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:14,840
I didn't get slides

1943
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,060
okay my account's worth

1944
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,699
um let's talk about the composite

1945
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:36,379
stuff uh next slide

1946
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:43,199
so I'll acknowledge first there's a lot

1947
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,000
of I mean it's been going discussions

1948
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,020
going for a long time but weather

1949
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,940
composite or

1950
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,679
um non-complex like any if any of the

1951
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,560
hybrid stuff is like

1952
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,880
fundamentally actually useful or if

1953
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,800
we're just spinning trying to develop

1954
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,600
this stuff and I acknowledge that's a

1955
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,639
good debate and there's good arguments

1956
01:20:59,639 --> 01:21:02,639
and NSA and ncsc have made their points

1957
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,739
clear and have good solid arguments and

1958
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:06,480
I'm not necessarily you know trying to

1959
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,420
push that composite is the way

1960
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:12,239
I do think though there's probably you

1961
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:14,400
know there exists a case in which it's

1962
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,900
useful and therefore I think there

1963
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,840
exists reason to standardize it and if

1964
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,540
people are going to do it anyway you

1965
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:22,440
know for

1966
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,139
even if it's for ill devised purposes I

1967
01:21:25,139 --> 01:21:26,820
think giving a standardized way to do it

1968
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,760
that's been cfrg reviewed is probably

1969
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,000
you know generally good for Humanity so

1970
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,440
I'm not up here trying to argue that

1971
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,540
composite is the one and only way but I

1972
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,040
am up here arguing that I think if

1973
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,300
people are going to do it we should

1974
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,840
standardize it and also it's easy and we

1975
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,940
can do it

1976
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,659
independently from the algorithm

1977
01:21:45,659 --> 01:21:46,860
definitions because it's totally

1978
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,219
algorithm agnostics so like why not this

1979
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:52,920
is sort of why I'm up here

1980
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,199
um so this slide deck is basically a

1981
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:56,880
call for adoption

1982
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,560
um I think keys and sigs are ready for

1983
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,920
adoption so I've my Sean had no slides

1984
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,020
on adoption I have like six slides on

1985
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,120
why I think adoption is appropriate and

1986
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,340
then I've got a bid at the bottom about

1987
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,260
um Ken's we have a composite chem

1988
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:13,760
dropped up so let's go

1989
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:18,920
foreign

1990
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,719
so here's the status of the composite

1991
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:24,540
drafts Keys is an O2 and I think it's

1992
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,639
mature and ready for adoption signatures

1993
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:28,500
is an 07 I think it's ready for adoption

1994
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,420
we've done a lot of sort of Shifting

1995
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,040
stuff back and forth between the keys

1996
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,540
and the sigs draft I think that's all

1997
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,880
sort of stabilized now

1998
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,400
the one thing that's missing that we

1999
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,760
like had in and actively removed is the

2000
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,960
and or k of n any like all that sort of

2001
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,600
policy stuff

2002
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,820
um yeah once we started having or and

2003
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,400
any as distinct modes it got stupid and

2004
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,199
we just took it out

2005
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,040
um

2006
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,320
so I think that needs to go back in like

2007
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,120
we've our co-authored D trust in

2008
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,679
particular is like already deploying

2009
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,540
those sorts of modes so we need a way to

2010
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,340
specify it that's standardized I think

2011
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,500
it belongs in the Sig's draft probably

2012
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,000
it belongs as part of the signature

2013
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,699
algorithm not as part of the public key

2014
01:23:11,699 --> 01:23:13,620
so that needs to go back in so these

2015
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,840
aren't final but um otherwise I think

2016
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,000
they're pretty mature and as you'll see

2017
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,440
in a few slides we've got lots of

2018
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,760
starting to have lots of running code

2019
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,800
which is a sort of a checkpoint in

2020
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,600
itself

2021
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,880
and then finally there's composite chems

2022
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,880
so we just got composite chem 0 0 up

2023
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,380
um if you'll remember about a year ago

2024
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,600
we put a composite encryption draft in

2025
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,880
front of lamps and that was really just

2026
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,800
to sort of Garner feedback and we got a

2027
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,380
lot and we proposed in that draft a

2028
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:41,639
number of different ways of doing

2029
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:45,000
composite and by encryption I mean

2030
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,980
um like CMS encryption where you're

2031
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,540
trying to encrypt for a recipient with

2032
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,040
multiple public keys on different

2033
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,139
algorithms in a way that the recipient

2034
01:23:52,139 --> 01:23:53,699
will have to use all their keys to

2035
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:55,320
unlock the content

2036
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,940
so we put forward a bunch of different

2037
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:59,040
proposals I think we've settled on

2038
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,560
wrapping it all up inside a chem so you

2039
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,920
can have an RSA key trans and an x25519

2040
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,560
and uh kyber and you roll them all up

2041
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,300
together and on the outside it looks

2042
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,340
like a single chem algorithm and will

2043
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,380
fit anywhere that again algorithm fits

2044
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:15,480
is the method we ended up settling on

2045
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,699
that's brand new I think that draft is

2046
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:19,080
currently more lines of endnote than

2047
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,620
lines of text so uh yeah please feedback

2048
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:25,400
okay next

2049
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,340
um rough consensus we've got a we're

2050
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:32,280
Gathering snowball of authors which is

2051
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,139
great we're starting to gather a fair

2052
01:24:34,139 --> 01:24:35,820
number of positive reviews which is

2053
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,020
great so I think we're clearing the

2054
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:38,460
rough consensus bar

2055
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:41,120
next

2056
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,260
I think we're also starting to clear the

2057
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:46,139
running code bar and Trust obviously has

2058
01:24:46,139 --> 01:24:48,620
you know we we have this uh

2059
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:50,880
semi-semi-commercially uh bouncy castle

2060
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,440
recently we just did full integration

2061
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,420
tests against bouncy castle so that's

2062
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:56,639
like full

2063
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,199
um supportive composite

2064
01:24:58,199 --> 01:25:00,420
uh we are currently working on an oqs

2065
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:02,699
open SSL implementation I think we'll

2066
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:06,120
have that complete by 115. and then our

2067
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,260
co-authors obviously have their own

2068
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,179
proprietary which were sort of in

2069
01:25:09,179 --> 01:25:12,179
various stages of uh integration testing

2070
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:13,739
against so I think we're also clearing

2071
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:16,020
the running code bar here

2072
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,780
dkg

2073
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,420
uh hi Daniel Khan Gilmore uh so thanks

2074
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,699
for doing this work uh it's obviously

2075
01:25:23,699 --> 01:25:25,320
something that people want and we want

2076
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,120
to put it forward and I just wanted to

2077
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,739
try to clarify

2078
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:29,760
um

2079
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,139
there's I heard a lot of pushback in

2080
01:25:31,139 --> 01:25:34,260
this room earlier about parameters right

2081
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:35,820
we don't want to have parameters we

2082
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:38,040
don't want to have you know too many

2083
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:42,000
fiddly bits we want something specific

2084
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,060
this appears to be uh

2085
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,040
it's not using parameters

2086
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,920
but it is allowing a wide range of

2087
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,139
choices right because you can it's it's

2088
01:25:52,139 --> 01:25:54,420
abstract enough that you can composite

2089
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:57,000
arbitrary things together uh yes and no

2090
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,260
depending on which section you're

2091
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:59,159
reading

2092
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:00,719
okay

2093
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:01,620
um

2094
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,780
so I I guess I just wanted to highlight

2095
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:04,980
that this seems like attention here

2096
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,840
we're going to run into this in the open

2097
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,820
pgp working group as well when open btp

2098
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,020
gets around to doing this and I wanted

2099
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,360
to try to understand your thinking about

2100
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,699
or the group's thinking about

2101
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:18,300
why we want as much flexibility as there

2102
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:19,920
is here and what kind of constraints and

2103
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,600
flexibility you're willing to tolerate

2104
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,239
yeah so good question so we've written

2105
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,699
the draft just trying to provide tools

2106
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:29,040
like anywhere people have asked for a

2107
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,800
tool sure we can you know try and

2108
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,080
provide it so the draft at one point we

2109
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,420
had like generic composite and explicit

2110
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:38,219
composite as two separate drafts and

2111
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:41,100
we've now merged them so you can you can

2112
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:44,460
now with the same wire format say like

2113
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:46,320
like have an oid that says I am a

2114
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,060
generic composite public key and you'll

2115
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:50,340
have to look inside me to see what I am

2116
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:53,239
or you can have an oid that says I am an

2117
01:26:53,239 --> 01:26:55,920
x25519 kyber key

2118
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,480
and that's going to be a bit of an oil

2119
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,560
explosion because you'll need to roll

2120
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,780
all the pairwise parameters in but we

2121
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,580
also provide a structure for minting

2122
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,980
those explicit combinations where the

2123
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,600
oid will tell you what's going to be in

2124
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,780
it

2125
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,900
so I I guess

2126
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,699
I was trying to point out that all of

2127
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:15,719
these parameters and all this

2128
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:17,580
flexibility and all this toolkit is

2129
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:19,440
appealing to those of us who like fancy

2130
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,380
tools

2131
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:24,300
but when we're talking about interop on

2132
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,940
the actual Network what we need is clear

2133
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:31,560
guidance and uh constraints right if if

2134
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,600
you if you pave a big parking lot people

2135
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,820
will crash but if you give them rails

2136
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,739
they'll ride in the direction that you

2137
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:39,659
want them to ride and it sounds to me

2138
01:27:39,659 --> 01:27:41,100
like this is Paving a big parking lot

2139
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:44,540
and there's going to be some crashes

2140
01:27:47,159 --> 01:27:49,320
um hey this is Sean Turner um I just

2141
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,880
want to say that one of the reasons why

2142
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,980
we went for the don't do the whole

2143
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:54,480
composite thing was

2144
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,400
a little bit of that and you're right

2145
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,719
because there are rails but people can

2146
01:27:57,719 --> 01:27:59,699
like put three wheels on it and like do

2147
01:27:59,699 --> 01:28:01,620
all kinds of fun things and one of the

2148
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,719
reasons why we decided to go with less

2149
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:06,540
right is is that you're arguing an

2150
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:09,719
analogy oh yeah so I'm not trying to say

2151
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:11,880
good or bad whatever but like at the end

2152
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,100
of the day when this did elliptic curve

2153
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:16,080
we had too many choices and people were

2154
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,580
like what are we gonna do and oh look

2155
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:18,960
we've got this name curve thing and

2156
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,060
we'll give you this crazy pants stuff so

2157
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:25,080
we did the 5480 draft uh RFC ended up as

2158
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,639
a tiger team and I remember we got on

2159
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,679
the call and uh

2160
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:30,780
um the guy from Microsoft his name's

2161
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:32,639
escaping note uh

2162
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,100
Kelvin was just like stop with the

2163
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:37,139
choices we don't want to do all this and

2164
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:38,820
it was like let's just pick annoyed well

2165
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,920
great then all this crazy pants asn1

2166
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,540
stuff that wish we would have to specify

2167
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:44,880
just fell away I don't know that helped

2168
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,320
I think IPR was actually the bigger

2169
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,060
problem but at the end of the day that

2170
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,620
was one of the things where it was like

2171
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:51,960
there's too many and so that's why from

2172
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,699
my perspective when we're doing it let's

2173
01:28:53,699 --> 01:28:56,580
just do less because maybe that is but

2174
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:57,960
if it's a commercial need I don't know

2175
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,239
because I mean PKS doesn't have a really

2176
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,239
good track record or the pki world of

2177
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:05,159
picking a clear winner there's like six

2178
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:06,780
enrollment protocols right if you're

2179
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:08,820
running an Enterprise it sucks right

2180
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,320
because you got to support every one of

2181
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,179
those freaking things and it is it is

2182
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:14,760
what it is right so I don't know that's

2183
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,860
just some background for for

2184
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,480
thoughts for future when you go to

2185
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,340
openpgp and be like what do we want to

2186
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:21,540
do

2187
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:24,179
so I was putting thinking putting on my

2188
01:29:24,179 --> 01:29:25,860
hat is like editor of this draft if

2189
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:26,940
that's what the working group wants to

2190
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:29,219
do we want to like use the Machinery we

2191
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:30,659
have here but then just say you know

2192
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:32,520
Thou shalt to these two algorithms I'm

2193
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,800
fine if it turns into that that's a

2194
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,360
totally reasonable direction for this

2195
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,659
okay next

2196
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,239
so on the topic of running code my

2197
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:47,280
co-worker John Gray and I are gonna

2198
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,840
volunteer to show up at the 115

2199
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,580
hackathon uh with the interest

2200
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:52,020
implementation the bouncy castle

2201
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,719
implementation the uh hopefully by then

2202
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:58,080
oqs implementation and that's that would

2203
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:02,580
be I guess like signatures and chems if

2204
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,380
that happens as well as composite like

2205
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:06,440
if you want to come and test your PQ

2206
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:10,440
x509 you know crl s mime whatever we're

2207
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,699
going to be at that we're gonna

2208
01:30:11,699 --> 01:30:13,320
volunteer to be at the hackathon to come

2209
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,420
test against I think we're I think we're

2210
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,460
sort of ready for that

2211
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:20,040
next question about your plans are are

2212
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,199
you are you Michael Richardson are you

2213
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:23,100
um

2214
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:24,600
are you going to run some enrollment

2215
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,920
protocols because we have so many of

2216
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,100
them

2217
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:31,080
is that Wonder response yeah yeah no I

2218
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,340
actually I'm serious I was thinking

2219
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,540
about this and go well there's no point

2220
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:34,920
in me bringing my open SSL

2221
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,420
implementation of a CA that does

2222
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:38,040
something because you already have one

2223
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,560
but then occurred to me but the the what

2224
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,239
I have clients that would want to talk

2225
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,520
to it because I would now of course like

2226
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:48,719
to sign a CSR with a PQ algorithm right

2227
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:52,980
and send it to you and get something so

2228
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,540
um that so that's why I'm seriously

2229
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:55,980
actually asking that question is that

2230
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:59,520
within your your thinking the hackathon

2231
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,360
I mean so so let's use some mail list

2232
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,320
bandwidth deciding what people want then

2233
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,440
show up and test it yeah I was just

2234
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,719
going to say whatever you want we can

2235
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,719
probably do and oh we can already do

2236
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:17,520
csrs and sign them with this stuff okay

2237
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,219
all that cool stuff so let us know in

2238
01:31:20,219 --> 01:31:22,639
the mail list

2239
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:27,080
okay next

2240
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,159
uh this slide I don't know that I

2241
01:31:29,159 --> 01:31:30,780
necessarily needed it but it's sort of a

2242
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:33,300
plug I personally don't view the

2243
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,460
composite and non-composite as

2244
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:37,980
um like competing in fact I think

2245
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,900
there's a lot of good uses for both that

2246
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,540
are independent like the negotiated TLS

2247
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:45,480
type stuff non-composite probably makes

2248
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,699
a lot more sense but the totally offline

2249
01:31:47,699 --> 01:31:49,920
you know code signing whatever maybe the

2250
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,179
composite does make a lot more sense

2251
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:53,219
like I think there's you know there

2252
01:31:53,219 --> 01:31:55,620
exists at least one strong argument use

2253
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,360
case for each

2254
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,440
um I also want to point out because I

2255
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,179
think this gets lost a bit that it's

2256
01:32:00,179 --> 01:32:02,159
totally possible to do both together at

2257
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:04,139
the same time like you could imagine a

2258
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:06,420
non-composite TLS handshake you show up

2259
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:08,520
with two separate certificates from two

2260
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:11,040
separate Cas and one of them happens to

2261
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:15,600
be a composite x509 RX x2509 and kyber

2262
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,840
together and you

2263
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,760
non-composite that with the RSA or like

2264
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,380
you know you can imagine he's getting

2265
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,639
used together so I don't know that

2266
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:25,500
they're competing and I don't I don't

2267
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,880
want to think of them as competing I

2268
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,860
think they're both useful

2269
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:30,659
I didn't not in the back and I think I

2270
01:32:30,659 --> 01:32:34,500
do want to chat with you hi next

2271
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:37,500
uh just a reminder we have Milestones

2272
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,960
dated like you know in the past adopting

2273
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,000
these drafts would satisfy

2274
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,020
next

2275
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:46,560
[Laughter]

2276
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,139
uh yeah here's John's slide

2277
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:53,360
um yeah are we ready to adopties

2278
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,760
hi Jonathan Hamel so what what concerned

2279
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,260
me is that you're asking for adoption

2280
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:04,139
but then early on you said that oh well

2281
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:07,380
you ripped out the composite ore in any

2282
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:10,620
but you may put that back in and to me I

2283
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:13,440
think that how it is now where it's

2284
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,600
simple it's and

2285
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,659
um should be done first and then

2286
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:21,239
separate draft could do the Alternatives

2287
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:22,620
because

2288
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,540
because they have different security

2289
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:26,159
considerations

2290
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:29,219
yeah the modes can go in and separate

2291
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:32,159
drafts there and possibly different IPR

2292
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:35,340
because there is an IPR statement on on

2293
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:38,120
this draft

2294
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,380
Gilmore again

2295
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,300
um I I do think that these should be

2296
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:46,679
adopted it seems like that's what we're

2297
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:48,360
talking about in this working group and

2298
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:50,880
it's obviously it's a milestone so sure

2299
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,820
I wanna

2300
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:56,100
um my understanding from this the point

2301
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,620
earlier about well we we might want to

2302
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:01,980
add in add back in the or or the N of K

2303
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:04,080
of n or whatever and adding that

2304
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,060
specifically to the signatures

2305
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:09,120
worries me a bit in that if you're

2306
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,580
saying here is one composite key

2307
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,199
and it can make two different kinds of

2308
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:14,639
signatures

2309
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,159
you're now creating a negotiation

2310
01:34:17,159 --> 01:34:18,179
problem

2311
01:34:18,179 --> 01:34:20,940
right because someone who's going to be

2312
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:22,980
relying on a signature is now is to

2313
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:25,199
express to the signer which types of

2314
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,360
signatures that's that key can produce

2315
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,580
and I don't know in the places where

2316
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,800
this plans to be used if we have any

2317
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,840
clear documentation about what kinds of

2318
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,139
negotiation might be done

2319
01:34:37,139 --> 01:34:39,840
in the interest of did I did I

2320
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,460
understand what you're proposing for

2321
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:42,960
making that change

2322
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,300
I mean I guess I'm I'm seconding the the

2323
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,400
earlier comment that said please let's

2324
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,320
not drag that stuff back in let's just

2325
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,799
go with that

2326
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:55,199
yeah so uh first comment is um I'm

2327
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:56,639
trying not like I didn't do any

2328
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,020
technical content in these slides I'm

2329
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,400
just trying to keep it focused on

2330
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,380
adoption and maybe mailing list is in

2331
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:02,400
the interest of time better for

2332
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,659
technicals

2333
01:35:03,659 --> 01:35:06,300
um second yeah the and versus or I mean

2334
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,980
there are use cases for or they exist

2335
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:09,900
there's people who can they want a flag

2336
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,060
day now to support composite and start

2337
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,920
shipping them and then Flag Day later to

2338
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,179
turn the algorithms on like there's

2339
01:35:15,179 --> 01:35:16,860
those sorts of use cases floating around

2340
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:18,659
it's like I think there's enough people

2341
01:35:18,659 --> 01:35:21,780
who want an ore and just people who want

2342
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:23,040
or in sort of all sorts of weird

2343
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,659
permutations

2344
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:26,340
like every time I take it out I get

2345
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,800
pushed back so I

2346
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,800
I don't know

2347
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:36,360
Victor Duchovny uh Google public DNS uh

2348
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,639
I'm wondering uh how this plays into

2349
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:41,040
things like you know tlsa records which

2350
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:44,040
carry a hash of an spki you know is this

2351
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,619
does this not become ambiguous uh in

2352
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:50,040
light of the uh the new complexity uh

2353
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:51,780
you know if I will know that I trust a

2354
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:54,960
particular spki uh you know if it can be

2355
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,760
used in a variety of ways I guess it's

2356
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:59,100
the same question in some ways uh what's

2357
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,780
likely to be happening here that already

2358
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:03,239
exists with RSA right an RSA key can be

2359
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:05,280
used with a number of assigning

2360
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,380
algorithms is that fundamentally

2361
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:09,980
different here

2362
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:12,840
thank you

2363
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,159
uh

2364
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:17,460
if it's the same p uh it doesn't really

2365
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:20,760
matter which algorithm if tlsa can

2366
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,980
specify TLS you negotiate the signature

2367
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:25,020
algorithms on The Wire it's not a big

2368
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:27,420
deal yeah maybe this is a mailing list

2369
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:28,920
topic probably deeper than I can think

2370
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,600
of on the spot but the answer probably

2371
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:32,219
is no there's a canonical encoding for

2372
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:34,699
these and

2373
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:41,880
look at that I did it okay so this is

2374
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,880
Deb cooling sorry I took my badge off um

2375
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,619
so my

2376
01:36:46,619 --> 01:36:49,260
while I think it's very good that you've

2377
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,179
got a bunch of people interested in

2378
01:36:51,179 --> 01:36:54,619
implementing these fancy tools

2379
01:36:54,619 --> 01:36:59,100
my question is who do you envisage as

2380
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:02,600
the users of these things

2381
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:06,119
as a person who deals with very large

2382
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:07,440
pkis

2383
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:11,239
I will tell you I do not see those pkis

2384
01:37:11,239 --> 01:37:14,219
using these tools

2385
01:37:14,219 --> 01:37:16,560
so my question is who is the Right

2386
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:19,880
audience for these things

2387
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:23,100
yeah that's a fabulous question that

2388
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:24,600
I've been asked every time I get up here

2389
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,580
and I still don't have an answer that I

2390
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:28,020
can say publicly I mean we do have

2391
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:29,880
customers who would buy it but I can't

2392
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:32,340
you know use them as an example and no

2393
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:34,440
one's really come forward just as a

2394
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:36,900
co-author to as a user base it's a fair

2395
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,520
it's a fair question that I acknowledge

2396
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,380
so my question is if you're going to

2397
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:42,239
call for adoption and spend working

2398
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:44,940
group time to work on something that is

2399
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:47,100
indeed a fancy tool and very complicated

2400
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:50,219
and unlikely in my opinion to be

2401
01:37:50,219 --> 01:37:53,100
implemented correctly on a regular basis

2402
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,420
if ever

2403
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,400
question is are you actually interested

2404
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:59,839
in spending working group time on it

2405
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,440
yeah I was just going to say that kind

2406
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,820
of puts it down around what I was going

2407
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,260
to say but

2408
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:14,100
um

2409
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,239
well I was just going to say we're

2410
01:38:15,239 --> 01:38:17,040
calling for adoption to it

2411
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,300
in regards to one of the previous

2412
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,940
questions so I mean we expect that there

2413
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:23,340
will be some changes or you know

2414
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,320
depending on what happens on the mailing

2415
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,480
list like the andon or discussion like

2416
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,219
Mike said that's come and gone and come

2417
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:30,600
and gone

2418
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,679
um

2419
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:36,000
so yeah that's expected in terms of uh I

2420
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,060
guess maybe to address what Deb was just

2421
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:42,179
saying I mean I can't acknowledge

2422
01:38:42,179 --> 01:38:43,920
customers as well but I know we have a

2423
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,199
lot of people interested in using this I

2424
01:38:46,199 --> 01:38:48,420
think the extra security that it can

2425
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:51,480
provide especially if you're looking at

2426
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:52,920
the transition period where we're not

2427
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,320
sure we trust these post Quantum

2428
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,719
algorithms fully yet but we're not sure

2429
01:38:57,719 --> 01:38:59,219
if there's a quantum computer I think

2430
01:38:59,219 --> 01:39:02,100
that is a very compelling use case for

2431
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:05,219
using these and I think customers with

2432
01:39:05,219 --> 01:39:07,320
high shirts pkis

2433
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:10,139
would appreciate that so that's that's

2434
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:13,340
how I see that so

2435
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:17,280
a lot of maybe a bit of a a completely

2436
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,400
hand wavy answer to Deb's question

2437
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,560
um in that it just opens more

2438
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,780
permutations but you could imagine using

2439
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:28,380
the sigs without using the keys like you

2440
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,560
could imagine a multi-certificate

2441
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,840
operation that wants to carry its

2442
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,219
multiple signatures in the composite

2443
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,420
structure

2444
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:38,639
like an example would be the CMS sign

2445
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,080
data you know we can already already

2446
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:43,560
carry multiple certs but maybe you want

2447
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,480
to to Really make it clear that this is

2448
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,219
a composite operation you want to roll

2449
01:39:47,219 --> 01:39:49,380
them into a single signature and so you

2450
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:51,060
want the data format to have one

2451
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:53,040
signature that points back to multiple

2452
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,020
certificates like there might be there

2453
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:57,540
might be uses like that I don't not

2454
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:58,920
aware of any protocols that want to do

2455
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,420
that yet but

2456
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:03,260
let's see

2457
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,000
you know nobody this is Roy Williams if

2458
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,380
don't be standing up to say hey they

2459
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,679
want to build something cool and and

2460
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:12,119
far-reaching on this just building it

2461
01:40:12,119 --> 01:40:14,280
and hoping somebody comes to it I think

2462
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:17,699
is a non-goal unless somebody's

2463
01:40:17,699 --> 01:40:19,199
willing to say hey this is what I want

2464
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:21,300
to use it for I think it's just open up

2465
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:24,139
a Pandora's Box

2466
01:40:30,659 --> 01:40:33,659
okay

2467
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:34,260
[Music]

2468
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:34,800
um

2469
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,800
let's take these separately does anyone

2470
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,699
um

2471
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:41,460
at this point object to a call for

2472
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:45,199
adoption on composite keys

2473
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:50,219
well we have at least one on in chat

2474
01:40:50,219 --> 01:40:52,340
um

2475
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,239
so

2476
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:57,300
uh Yuri if you would like to talk to

2477
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,100
your reasons for not liking composite I

2478
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,300
think it would be a good thing to do at

2479
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,600
this time

2480
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:10,920
so so we need to discuss that further on

2481
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:12,900
the list

2482
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,020
um and is there anyone who would speak

2483
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:19,080
against a call for adoption on composite

2484
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:21,559
cigs

2485
01:41:28,699 --> 01:41:31,679
it's the Andor thing right sorry this is

2486
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:33,420
Jonathan Hamill again so just to

2487
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,699
reiterate my previous comment if the

2488
01:41:35,699 --> 01:41:38,100
plan is to significantly change from

2489
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:41,699
what it is now I abduct to adoption on

2490
01:41:41,699 --> 01:41:43,260
the draft because I think that needs to

2491
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:45,840
be fixed before we do the call for

2492
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,360
adoption okay so let's be clear

2493
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:51,540
um is anyone object to a call for

2494
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:53,940
composite cigs with the with the current

2495
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:57,080
and structure

2496
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:02,580
yeah so at least one person is again so

2497
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:04,199
we're going to discuss that on the list

2498
01:42:04,199 --> 01:42:05,699
as well

2499
01:42:05,699 --> 01:42:08,219
okay thank you perfect and then one more

2500
01:42:08,219 --> 01:42:10,460
slide

2501
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,639
I guess technically technically two more

2502
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:17,639
slides uh yeah so composite chems

2503
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:19,860
um assuming this is a thing we want to

2504
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:21,060
do

2505
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:24,659
um so this this draft is complicated

2506
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:26,580
cryptographically and I don't want to

2507
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:27,960
spend a lot of time up here other than

2508
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:30,300
to say that this has been slow to come

2509
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:33,360
out because we had to define a bunch of

2510
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:36,540
crypto which is a terrifying sentence

2511
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:38,460
um

2512
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,380
so the two pieces of crypto we couldn't

2513
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,239
avoid having to Define is

2514
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,520
Transformations from a key trends into a

2515
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,500
chem and from a key agree into a chem so

2516
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,179
we can then treat everything as a chem

2517
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:50,040
and combine chems with chems I think

2518
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,900
those Transformations are sound we base

2519
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:55,159
one of them at least on Roc 5990 RSA cam

2520
01:42:55,159 --> 01:42:57,840
the key agree to chem I think is also

2521
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,280
sound that it's new crypto so I'm

2522
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,880
flagging it and then combiners is like a

2523
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,300
mess as soon as you allow RSA key trans

2524
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:08,100
where the attacker could potentially

2525
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:09,719
have full control over the shared secret

2526
01:43:09,719 --> 01:43:11,820
and then they get concatenated and you

2527
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:13,139
got to worry about one shared secret

2528
01:43:13,139 --> 01:43:16,380
doing block Cipher boundary junk against

2529
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:18,000
the other shared secret then it becomes

2530
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,639
a mess there's a fair amount of academic

2531
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:23,219
literature out there and like fresh to

2532
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:26,280
the 2018 2019 2021 about how to do

2533
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,800
combiners and you know you've got some

2534
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,239
number of shared secrets and some number

2535
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,340
of Cipher texts and you want to somehow

2536
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:33,960
roll them into one shared secret and

2537
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,460
there seems to be a lot of different

2538
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:37,260
proposals for how to do that with

2539
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:40,820
terrifying complexity so that's

2540
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:43,619
yeah that that's a bit scary and that

2541
01:43:43,619 --> 01:43:45,659
it's not clear how to do that

2542
01:43:45,659 --> 01:43:48,960
um maybe one way is we sort of we

2543
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,639
restrict ourselves down like restrict

2544
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:51,960
the problem statement down so it's more

2545
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,580
tractable like maybe we just ban key

2546
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:56,520
trends and then a lot of this goes away

2547
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,320
um TLS doesn't have this much problem

2548
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,119
because they're ephemeral ephemeral you

2549
01:44:00,119 --> 01:44:02,000
don't have to worry about like adaptive

2550
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,920
attacks because the server is only going

2551
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:07,560
to use its key once but in CMS you do so

2552
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:08,940
I think this is a more difficult problem

2553
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:11,520
than what TLS is tackling and it's yeah

2554
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,860
we need help or Direction

2555
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:16,320
uh either in doing the crypto rate or in

2556
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,880
simplifying the problem

2557
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:20,480
thank you

2558
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:29,280
okay so that sounded like a plea for

2559
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:32,360
review to me

2560
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,060
complicated crypto stuff here is what I

2561
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:37,920
heard

2562
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,560
um

2563
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:42,679
all right

2564
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,100
I don't know who's presenting Ali

2565
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:53,540
Rebecca or Mike okay

2566
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,679
hello I'm Rebecca Guthrie I'm one of the

2567
01:45:04,679 --> 01:45:07,639
authors of this draft

2568
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:14,940
I know I uploaded the hierarchy in the

2569
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:17,059
list

2570
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:22,679
ing this morning I uploaded them

2571
01:45:22,679 --> 01:45:27,360
but they're not in the list to share why

2572
01:45:27,659 --> 01:45:30,440
foreign

2573
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,480
with other words

2574
01:46:05,159 --> 01:46:09,019
sorry about that no worries

2575
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:12,900
okay so I'm just gonna give a hopefully

2576
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:15,300
brief update on the changes we've made

2577
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:18,119
since the previous version of this draft

2578
01:46:18,119 --> 01:46:20,179
um

2579
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,800
so we uploaded the first version in

2580
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:25,320
March we presented on it at the lamps

2581
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:27,420
interim in April and we uploaded a new

2582
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:29,520
version in June based on the comments we

2583
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,840
received at the interim and on the

2584
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,639
mailing list

2585
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:36,119
I'm excited uh so some general changes

2586
01:46:36,119 --> 01:46:39,119
uh we changed the title of the document

2587
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:42,179
um and we added a section which just

2588
01:46:42,179 --> 01:46:44,040
gives an overview of the intended use

2589
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:46,440
case for this document uh specifically

2590
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:50,219
this is um if you're using a certificate

2591
01:46:50,219 --> 01:46:52,260
with a traditional algorithm and you

2592
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:54,179
want to transition to using a post

2593
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:56,280
Quantum certificate possibly in

2594
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,840
conjunction with the traditional

2595
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:58,980
certificate

2596
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,080
last we narrowed the scope of the

2597
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,420
document so instead of using this

2598
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:05,460
mechanism for an arbitrary number of

2599
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,199
certificates we're just focusing on the

2600
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:10,260
two certificate case where you submit a

2601
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:13,080
CSR that references only one already

2602
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,300
existing certificate

2603
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:18,380
all right next one

2604
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:21,300
and so this is probably where we got

2605
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,119
most feedback and I think um we made a

2606
01:47:24,119 --> 01:47:26,460
significant number of changes here so we

2607
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:29,400
changed the name of the the attribute

2608
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,320
um and we added a couple values in as

2609
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,719
well so we added request time which is

2610
01:47:33,719 --> 01:47:37,320
binary time specified in RFC 6019 and

2611
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,239
this is to ensure freshness of the

2612
01:47:39,239 --> 01:47:40,560
attribute

2613
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,300
um we added in location info which is

2614
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:44,820
just access description from 5280. so

2615
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:46,380
this up just lets you point to the

2616
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:47,639
location of the already issued

2617
01:47:47,639 --> 01:47:49,320
certificate

2618
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,080
um let's see we kept um one of our

2619
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,659
Fields the same and this is just the

2620
01:47:54,659 --> 01:47:56,940
assure and serial number field and then

2621
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:59,159
last we changed the signature so

2622
01:47:59,159 --> 01:48:01,800
originally the signature was just um

2623
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,260
over that issue or in serial number and

2624
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,060
so now what we're doing is concatenating

2625
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:09,179
that value with the request time

2626
01:48:09,179 --> 01:48:11,520
and then signing

2627
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,199
all right next slide

2628
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:15,960
we also made a minor well not so minor

2629
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,480
just one change to the extension and so

2630
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,000
instead of including just the cert ID

2631
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,860
which is the issue and serial number

2632
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:24,960
we're hashing over the entire

2633
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,460
certificate

2634
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:28,619
and so when I say entire certificate I

2635
01:48:28,619 --> 01:48:30,780
mean the already issued certificate that

2636
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:32,340
we're referencing right that we want to

2637
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:35,300
to show is related

2638
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:37,380
um and I think that's about it um I

2639
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:40,199
didn't include a slide about questions

2640
01:48:40,199 --> 01:48:41,820
related to adoption but I'm happy to

2641
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:44,239
answer any

2642
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:50,000
questions

2643
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:54,179
uh sorry I didn't join the queue is the

2644
01:48:54,179 --> 01:48:55,800
request time just an answer or is it

2645
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,600
really expected to somehow line up with

2646
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,639
the clock so this doesn't already

2647
01:48:59,639 --> 01:49:04,260
defined type from RFC 6019 which is just

2648
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:07,020
binary time we didn't put any normative

2649
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:09,119
statements about how in sync this has to

2650
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,100
be with exactly you know when when the

2651
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:12,840
CSR is submitted

2652
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,360
um but but the idea is that this will

2653
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,940
prevent reuse of the signature value

2654
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:20,900
specifically

2655
01:49:24,179 --> 01:49:25,920
and so this is based on a comment we

2656
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:28,800
received in the the mail list to include

2657
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:34,219
a variable value in the signature

2658
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:39,000
okay I guess the question we've been

2659
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,340
asking all day is that he would have any

2660
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:45,560
objections to adopting this document

2661
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,340
okay

2662
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:02,099
so there's a request that the chairs add

2663
01:50:02,099 --> 01:50:03,540
this document to the related document

2664
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:04,560
list

2665
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:07,159
thank you

2666
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:16,320
all right

2667
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,719
I'm not seeing any objections so we'll

2668
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:20,580
have a call for adoption on the mail

2669
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:23,119
list thanks

2670
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:40,099
foreign

2671
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:49,760
just check that you're able to hear me

2672
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:53,219
yes we hear you right here perfect yes

2673
01:50:53,219 --> 01:50:55,739
hi everybody apologies that I can't be

2674
01:50:55,739 --> 01:50:58,260
there in person with you uh my name is

2675
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:00,900
Mike Osborne I work for IBM research in

2676
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,760
Switzerland

2677
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,920
um and responsible for the team that

2678
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,980
actually co-authored three of the nist

2679
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:11,099
um selected algorithms

2680
01:51:11,099 --> 01:51:14,099
um this is a joint work with a couple of

2681
01:51:14,099 --> 01:51:16,320
other with other industry vendors that

2682
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,820
have been looking in this topic for a

2683
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:18,480
while

2684
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,780
with the maybe the altruistic

2685
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:24,000
um thought about

2686
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,580
um let's look a little bit about

2687
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:28,260
um some of the learnings from from past

2688
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:30,420
episodes in crypto

2689
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:31,260
um

2690
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:33,420
realize that

2691
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:34,860
um I think one of the things to realize

2692
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:36,179
I think it's very

2693
01:51:36,179 --> 01:51:37,520
um

2694
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:41,159
in terms of simplification in terms of

2695
01:51:41,159 --> 01:51:42,960
hoping that there will be just two three

2696
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:45,599
uh oids for these things

2697
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:48,000
um it's a nice starting point but these

2698
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,099
algorithms never end up like that and

2699
01:51:50,099 --> 01:51:52,440
depending how you start is going to

2700
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:54,540
influence how you end up so so the aim

2701
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:57,239
of this document really is is a set of

2702
01:51:57,239 --> 01:52:00,179
um learnings on how to serialize and

2703
01:52:00,179 --> 01:52:02,340
identify Keys

2704
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:05,340
um in in the sense of both wire formats

2705
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:07,920
identification the need to compress

2706
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,260
certain things with the with it with

2707
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:12,239
with the with the aim that that would

2708
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:16,199
help let's say um provide some upfronts

2709
01:52:16,199 --> 01:52:17,940
um understanding about you know where

2710
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:20,340
things could evolve down the road

2711
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:22,920
we can go to the first slide please

2712
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:25,440
so this is the second iteration of the

2713
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:26,460
document

2714
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:28,500
right you you have controller with the

2715
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:31,920
slides oh if I uh apologies I'm a newbie

2716
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,239
here

2717
01:52:33,239 --> 01:52:38,179
um in terms of how to ah I see no yeah

2718
01:52:38,179 --> 01:52:41,639
okay that's my learning for today

2719
01:52:41,639 --> 01:52:42,599
um

2720
01:52:42,599 --> 01:52:44,480
so so

2721
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:47,480
[Laughter]

2722
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:50,940
never told them yeah so so we actually

2723
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:52,739
issued the document

2724
01:52:52,739 --> 01:52:57,179
um with all of the in this finalists

2725
01:52:57,179 --> 01:53:00,179
um earlier earlier in the year

2726
01:53:00,179 --> 01:53:01,739
um obviously

2727
01:53:01,739 --> 01:53:04,199
um there was some feedback in terms of

2728
01:53:04,199 --> 01:53:06,960
guidance around oids or come to oids in

2729
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,760
a little bit

2730
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,679
um there's this concept about actually

2731
01:53:10,679 --> 01:53:12,780
aligning with nist I mean actually my

2732
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:15,480
team is one of the teams negotiating and

2733
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:18,480
with nist on how the io IDs will look

2734
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:20,580
like and be defined

2735
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:24,719
um some feedback on asm1 syntax and

2736
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:26,219
things like this but

2737
01:53:26,219 --> 01:53:28,619
um and some revisions around feedback on

2738
01:53:28,619 --> 01:53:30,659
on some of the in the encoding so this

2739
01:53:30,659 --> 01:53:31,340
is

2740
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:33,599
really just to step back and say this

2741
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:35,400
document is really about the these are

2742
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:37,139
you know you need to encode private Keys

2743
01:53:37,139 --> 01:53:39,360
you need to encode public Keys let's

2744
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,580
let's look at how we can sort of like

2745
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:43,619
um you know Define define these such

2746
01:53:43,619 --> 01:53:45,300
they can be um

2747
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:46,920
let's say the learnings can be adopted

2748
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:48,599
then by all of the other things that

2749
01:53:48,599 --> 01:53:52,679
happen in in all of the other rfcs so we

2750
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:55,739
have a a draft update

2751
01:53:55,739 --> 01:53:57,480
um you've probably seen the next chart

2752
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:59,580
which is okay since that draft update

2753
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:03,179
nist has uh made their selections like I

2754
01:54:03,179 --> 01:54:04,679
can jump over that because you know the

2755
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:06,780
selections

2756
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:07,320
um

2757
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,960
but essentially there's work underway

2758
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:11,460
now to update the document in terms of

2759
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:13,020
removing other than this finalist

2760
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:14,760
algorithms

2761
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:16,679
um I picked up on the discussion about

2762
01:54:16,679 --> 01:54:18,599
one

2763
01:54:18,599 --> 01:54:22,980
document per algorithm versus multiple

2764
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:24,780
something that we can also look at but

2765
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:26,159
essentially we're restructuring the

2766
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:29,699
document according to the nist decision

2767
01:54:29,699 --> 01:54:32,219
um adding the swings algorithm

2768
01:54:32,219 --> 01:54:34,500
um because that was an alternative now

2769
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:38,159
it's uh now it's to be standardized

2770
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:38,820
um

2771
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:41,280
there was a set of discussion around

2772
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,219
this is a very hot discussion around

2773
01:54:44,219 --> 01:54:46,860
um you know among some of us on the um

2774
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:49,679
what's on the Enterprise side

2775
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:54,060
um in terms of the ASM one syntax

2776
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:55,860
um I mean it goes into things like

2777
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:57,840
partially populated keys so one of the

2778
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,820
learnings that we as an organization

2779
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:01,199
have had

2780
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:04,080
is that yes you can start off all nice

2781
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,659
with um you know you have the full keys

2782
01:55:06,659 --> 01:55:09,060
and everything but but but at some point

2783
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:11,340
then actually these really do not fit in

2784
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:13,920
some some existing protocols and

2785
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,900
standards and we needed to start to look

2786
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:18,300
at partially populated keys so for

2787
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:19,980
example private keys that do not have

2788
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:23,460
the public key inside them or where

2789
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:26,880
um or keys that can be expanded from a

2790
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,560
seed this sort of thing

2791
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,199
um and so so to look at those those

2792
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:33,480
trade-offs

2793
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:36,719
um let's say that discussion we decided

2794
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:40,139
to create a separate document

2795
01:55:40,139 --> 01:55:41,880
um because there's essentially a debate

2796
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:43,800
around where you want the complexity you

2797
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:46,199
will have complexity uh it's just a

2798
01:55:46,199 --> 01:55:48,060
question more of where you want it do

2799
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:51,179
you want it really in the serialization

2800
01:55:51,179 --> 01:55:53,099
layer or do you want it in the layers

2801
01:55:53,099 --> 01:55:56,580
above and um we thought it makes is a

2802
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:58,080
more value we create a separate document

2803
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,639
to sort of

2804
01:55:59,639 --> 01:56:01,739
um debate the pros and cons about this

2805
01:56:01,739 --> 01:56:05,000
this will essentially comes

2806
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,880
into the the question

2807
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,719
um no parameters or you know like one OD

2808
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:15,119
is is the parameters are implicit things

2809
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:16,679
like this

2810
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:19,139
um it's not going to be as easy as that

2811
01:56:19,139 --> 01:56:21,239
I can tell you now we know already that

2812
01:56:21,239 --> 01:56:24,599
they're going to be different forms of

2813
01:56:24,599 --> 01:56:26,540
um dilithium for example deterministic

2814
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:28,679
non-deterministic we know already

2815
01:56:28,679 --> 01:56:30,719
there's a lot of interest in the

2816
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:32,940
underlying symmetric

2817
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:35,219
um Primitives those that are accelerated

2818
01:56:35,219 --> 01:56:37,199
today those that are not

2819
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:42,179
so we we do see that the this this nice

2820
01:56:42,179 --> 01:56:44,520
concept of of Simplicity is just not

2821
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:45,960
going to be like that going down so this

2822
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:48,179
is essentially it's just that to help

2823
01:56:48,179 --> 01:56:51,060
debate um that

2824
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:55,139
um decisions around those sort of things

2825
01:56:55,139 --> 01:56:57,000
um obviously alignment with nist because

2826
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,739
aren't we're debating with this on on

2827
01:56:58,739 --> 01:57:00,840
this topic

2828
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:03,360
um the there's interesting discussions

2829
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:06,420
around hybrid versus composite

2830
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:08,580
um we prefer to call these multi-key

2831
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:10,739
modes

2832
01:57:10,739 --> 01:57:14,520
um because uh for there's various

2833
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:17,580
reasons among them IP reasons

2834
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:22,500
so um we understand observe and and and

2835
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:24,360
um I think it's great that the other

2836
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:27,599
proposals going off in this direction

2837
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:28,520
um

2838
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:30,599
and the

2839
01:57:30,599 --> 01:57:33,000
um it's kind of like to understand so so

2840
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,920
what this what that really this this

2841
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,719
proposal is about is is really key

2842
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:39,960
Centric so so it really it's really kind

2843
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,360
of framed around keys not how these keys

2844
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:44,460
are used in signatures or how these keys

2845
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:45,300
are used

2846
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:47,280
in

2847
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,139
um into exchange protocols and things

2848
01:57:49,139 --> 01:57:50,940
but but really it's it's the debate

2849
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:54,000
around uh storing defining and attaching

2850
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,900
keys to the the algorithms uh to to

2851
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:00,659
support them so um

2852
01:58:00,659 --> 01:58:04,320
so so there are there are some uh very

2853
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,119
ongoing debates around these multi-key

2854
01:58:06,119 --> 01:58:08,340
modes as as we've heard in some of the

2855
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:11,460
uh discussions right now

2856
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:13,260
and then

2857
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:16,139
um so if we look at I can give examples

2858
01:58:16,139 --> 01:58:18,300
of the platform that we have now so that

2859
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:21,360
the on IBM's larger platforms we're

2860
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,739
already on our second generation of

2861
01:58:22,739 --> 01:58:25,020
these algorithms we're already signing

2862
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:26,400
things that need to be around a long

2863
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,739
time and so then there are there is the

2864
01:58:28,739 --> 01:58:30,179
question of

2865
01:58:30,179 --> 01:58:33,719
um migrating not keys but actually uh

2866
01:58:33,719 --> 01:58:35,760
Keys being able to support or migrate

2867
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,320
between

2868
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:39,119
um different versions of algorithms so

2869
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:41,880
so some debate around

2870
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:44,460
um insofar as that's possible and it has

2871
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:47,040
been possible to

2872
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,840
um to look at what it takes then to

2873
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:49,800
actually

2874
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:52,260
um migrate Keys between different

2875
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:55,380
versions of the algorithm

2876
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:58,260
so as a newbie I think that's the last

2877
01:58:58,260 --> 01:58:59,580
slide

2878
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:02,580
I think that's the last slide

2879
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:03,179
um

2880
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:07,260
so we will update in the next days the

2881
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:08,940
um the draft that we have to to

2882
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:11,480
represent in this selection as mentioned

2883
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:15,599
and thinking I think I'm asking for this

2884
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:19,320
to be adopted as a um as as a working

2885
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:21,480
item but then please correct me as if

2886
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:24,900
I'm using the wrong nomenclature

2887
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:27,659
so so Mike I'm kind of concerned that

2888
01:59:27,659 --> 01:59:30,000
the direction that you're taking and the

2889
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,139
one we decided earlier are at odds

2890
01:59:34,139 --> 01:59:37,860
um that you have all the finalists in

2891
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:39,900
here well you have even more than that

2892
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:41,699
but um

2893
01:59:41,699 --> 01:59:45,000
and we're not sure that nist is going to

2894
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,940
release them all at the same time and so

2895
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:49,800
we can't approve we can't get ahead of

2896
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:53,340
mist and so the way you've structured it

2897
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:55,739
we could not approve this document till

2898
01:59:55,739 --> 01:59:57,679
all of the

2899
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:00,360
algorithms are published whereas if you

2900
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:03,300
had one per algorithm we could

2901
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:07,679
release the as they were done

2902
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:09,360
I think that's fine I think that's

2903
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:10,920
that's what I picked up so so actually

2904
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,020
then to restructure the document where

2905
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:15,119
to actually create four documents out of

2906
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:17,540
this I think sounds like a sensible

2907
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:21,360
suggestion yeah and so we'll we'll do a

2908
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,880
call for adapt on each of those oh okay

2909
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:27,139
okay that's how it works okay

2910
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:30,060
okay

2911
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:31,260
um

2912
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:33,599
Michael's running to the mic Michael

2913
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:36,239
Richardson um so as I understand you are

2914
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:39,119
doing the private key formats in pkcs8

2915
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:42,000
for the various pieces

2916
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,860
that's that's right so I'm wondering

2917
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:48,179
when we do have formats for PK CSA yeah

2918
02:00:48,179 --> 02:00:51,239
yes it if you want to put them in pkcs8

2919
02:00:51,239 --> 02:00:53,159
this is how you do it right correct so

2920
02:00:53,159 --> 02:00:56,040
so I'm I have only learned through your

2921
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:58,260
document today so I'm ready yet but I'm

2922
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:00,900
I'm thinking that there's maybe a lot of

2923
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:02,520
commonality and so maybe the first

2924
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,380
document that we approve winds up having

2925
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:07,739
more details about things like that

2926
02:01:07,739 --> 02:01:09,719
um and then the subsequent ones just say

2927
02:01:09,719 --> 02:01:11,940
and

2928
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:14,159
I don't know okay I just wondered

2929
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:16,139
whether whether that's a part part where

2930
02:01:16,139 --> 02:01:19,500
we're we're no needlessly repeating or

2931
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:22,080
is it needful repeating no they're

2932
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:23,340
different enough they're really enough

2933
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:24,840
okay thank you

2934
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:27,560
especially if you look at Sphinx

2935
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:31,340
there's like nothing

2936
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,699
so um hi this is Sean Turner I guess

2937
02:01:35,699 --> 02:01:36,900
there'll be some overlap and we'll have

2938
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:38,400
to do some uh horse trading to figure

2939
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,960
out where they're gonna go because the

2940
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,280
draft that I had actually put the

2941
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,560
private key format in the draft as well

2942
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,179
so there's a little bit of like well

2943
02:01:45,179 --> 02:01:47,159
what are we gonna do because again one

2944
02:01:47,159 --> 02:01:49,260
place for the implementers to go I'm

2945
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:50,280
just trying to figure out what's gonna

2946
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:52,260
what's gonna go on so and again the only

2947
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:53,520
thing the only other thing I want to say

2948
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:57,060
is like in in very not too distant past

2949
02:01:57,060 --> 02:02:00,119
the choices didn't help so I understand

2950
02:02:00,119 --> 02:02:01,860
that some people want to have all the

2951
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:03,719
bells and whistles and all the knobs and

2952
02:02:03,719 --> 02:02:06,179
that didn't help broadly speak it didn't

2953
02:02:06,179 --> 02:02:08,340
help adoption it actually like slowed it

2954
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:09,840
down and then there was IPR in the whole

2955
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,639
nine yards so I appreciate when it's

2956
02:02:11,639 --> 02:02:13,260
like hey we can drop stuff out that

2957
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:15,239
sounds like compressed Keys is that IPR

2958
02:02:15,239 --> 02:02:17,940
I don't know so we'll see what happens

2959
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:21,199
when all the

2960
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:24,840
good point let's let's um

2961
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:26,520
let's have the discussion of whether

2962
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:28,860
when this being broken up should be put

2963
02:02:28,860 --> 02:02:30,960
into each of the other documents instead

2964
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:35,060
that'd be a option

2965
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,800
okay

2966
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:40,440
all right I'm shocked we only ran two

2967
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:44,900
minutes over all right thank you

2968
02:02:52,099 --> 02:02:56,659
is that a good thing or a bad thing

2969
02:03:03,470 --> 02:03:06,669
