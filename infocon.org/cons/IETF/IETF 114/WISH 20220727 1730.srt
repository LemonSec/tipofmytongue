1
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,800

2
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,039
in the room there's about 25 total in

3
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,320
the

4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,079
that are logged in via the online

5
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,320
various tools uh give people i don't

6
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,760
like two more minutes after lunch and

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,800
then we'll get going

8
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,479
look at that we're using the internet to

9
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,439
design the internet it's great

10
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,079
um

11
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,520
all right it's two minutes after the

12
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,878
bottom of the hour i think it's time to

13
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,319
get cranking here

14
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,200

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,280
hey this is the wish session

16
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,200
so if you're think you're supposed to be

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
someplace else i think we're in the

18
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
right place looking at the people in the

19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
room so

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,120
if not

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,360

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400

here's the well uh it's uh wednesday so

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
hopefully you've seen this by now

28
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,160
basically if you know something say

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
something about ipr um

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,239
you know be nice to people all the

31
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,720
various uh best best practices for how

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,640
to run a meeting etc

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,519
um

34
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,800
and uh

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
if you have any questions about these

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
ask

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,280
anyone in the room i think most of the

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
people i've hear i've seen before and

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,080
are well versed in this if you're remote

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,840
likewise

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,519
um just kind of want to highlight the

42
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,200
code of conduct not been a problem in

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
this working group luckily uh

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,480
basically try to you know treat

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,239
everybody with respect you know speak

46
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,720
slowly use the avoid the use of slang i

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,159
think they put that bullet in just for

48
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,959
me

49
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,040
um make sure to dispute ideas using

50
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
recent argument

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
use best engineering judgment find the

52
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,800
best solution for the whole the internet

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,080
and contribute to the ongoing work

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,040
and make sure that this applies to both

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,560
online and in person so the next thing

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,959
is the agenda um

57
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,000
pretty straightforward just a couple

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,760
things to remind you of no one here

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
everyone here is messed up but that's

60
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,560
really great to see

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,319
but if you're local make sure you're

62
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,280
messed up unless you're at the

63
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
microphone and i don't at the front of

64
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,640
the room and i don't know that anybody's

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,519
actually going to be at the front of the

66
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,599
room other than me so please keep your

67
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,720
mask on

68
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,000
again remember the no whale we just

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,040
talked about

70
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
please make sure to sign via the online

71
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,840
tool because that's how we're going to

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
be managing the queue to make it fair

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,400
for all the remote people to be able to

74
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,959
get in and out

75
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
and if you do that you also there's no

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
blue sheets as you'll notice

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,920
but we do need a note taker

78
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,480
and i'm looking around the room

79
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
and i'm curious who's going to be

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,519
willing to take notes

81
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,680
we don't need blow-by-blow minute notes

82
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,279
we just need kind of like high-level

83
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,560
actions

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,759
spencer you look down do you mind

85
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,240
it's also okay to look around the

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
vehicle oh that's true

87
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,600
is anybody else willing to jump in and

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,320
uh

89
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,840
take minutes for us

90
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,080
all right i think we're having a little

91
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,759
bit of blipping here on the network but

92
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,880
uh

93
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,160
spencer if you would do that that would

94
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
be greatly appreciated again we don't

95
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
need blow-by-moments i think this is

96
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,440
going to be fairly straightforward

97
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,039
because we're trying to resolve working

98
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,960
group last call comments and so we

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,320
really care about like what was the

100
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,720
resolution of the particular slide right

101
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,960
okay great appreciate it um and again we

102
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,479
really have like

103
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,080
we've got one document in this working

104
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,440
group it's the web draft and we're going

105
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,600
to go through the the remaining um items

106
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,680
that are outstanding or

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
what sergio wants to talk about in the

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
version oh four that's going to be the

109
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,600
the bulk of our time i kind of pick 30

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,720
minutes because i look at the number of

111
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
slides and i'm like yeah that's okay

112
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,759
and then we're going to kind of have a

113
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,440
discussion of like what the way forward

114
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,240
is and uh sergio has taken the uh

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,080
initiative to write up a draft for

116
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
things i think he wants to do going

117
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
forward so he kind of beat us to the

118
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,520
punch and so we kind of made he you know

119
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,880
semi combined slide deck and kind of

120
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,479
split it so there's there's two sets of

121
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,639
slides there but um i think we'll have

122
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,080
the way forward discussion first and

123
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,919
then try to figure out what the you know

124
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,360
what the way forward is and what we will

125
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
do with the working group so unless

126
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
there's any problems i'm going to go

127
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,360
ahead and run the slides for you

128
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,080
um sergio so go ahead and get in the

129
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,759
mic line and i will go on mute okay

130
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,840
hello

131
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,919

i said this is

134
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,240
a the presentation is about to

135

to

136
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,479
to comment all the issues that we have

137
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,800
or the feedback that i have received

138
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
for the working group last call and it

139
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,840
has all been addressed in the in the

140
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,639
draft so what i want there was not much

141
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,319
comments neither on the mailing list on

142

the project yeah i just wanted to review

146

all of them so we can get a

147
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,720
position that it is the way forward and

148
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,440
just not have money much more discussion

149
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,479

other clarification in support of what

one of them but not both

171
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,560
rewarding

172
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,120
about bundle support that it is

173
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
also requested

174
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,919
other than a section about how to handle

175
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,400
a multiple audio and video tracks in an

176
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
sdp offer from uh

177
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,479
from the the weak client in so we are

178
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,080
like a

179
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,560
future compatible for the upcoming

180
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,120
version of whip

181
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
and

182
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,360
clarific also a small clarification

183
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,599
while we chose the name of i service in

184
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,250
the in the relat attribute when

185
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,639
[Music]

186
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,599
because it is a term they chosen the

187
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,000
pickup from the wcc

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,199
standard

189
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,240
and

190
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,080
also a i have a

191
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
we have received or i have received a

192
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,879
feedback from ayanna about the draft and

193
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,680
they saw that there was some minutes on

194
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,719
some missing a registration that was

195
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,958
required specifically about the

196
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,519
the superspace for the extension

197
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,880
and

198
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
so i have other sitting here sorry i

199
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,240
have not

200
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,320
answered the email

201
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,360
but

202
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
about

203
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,560
but i have father's comment here so it

204
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,160
has been a kind of

205
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,959
a

206
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,399
interesting week

207
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,640
so sorry for not have been able to to

208
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,160
answer the email

209
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,040
but the

210
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,720
the feedback is addressed here so

211
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,680
necessary please

212
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,880
so this is the the list of the issues

213
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,120
that they um after discussing i think

214
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,839
that they will not be fixed and it is

215
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,839
okay in the rough as as they are right

216
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,120
now

217
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,080
uh

218
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
the one the first one was i have also

219
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
included the link to the end to the

220
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,800
issues to check the discussion

221
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,360
so the first one is that some protocol

222
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,920
operation and some normative language

223
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,440
was missing

224
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,240
but

225
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,200
we have seen that i mean when we

226
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,680
inherit things that are mandated

227
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,160
from in webrtc we don't need to

228
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,480
add the this informative language and we

229
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,120
can use yes lowercase a mass and things

230
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,399
like that

231
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,279
so

232
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,720
if there is any

233
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,800
particular case that you think that it

234
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,920
is not

235
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,480
this is not covered by written by from

236
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,080
webrtc please uh point it out but uh in

237
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,040
general as we think that it is covered

238
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,720
so on that first point from a chair's

239
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,560
perspective i think that actually helps

240
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,800
because if you start uh double up double

241
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,399
upping on the requirements language and

242
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,079
one ever changes in the other spec then

243
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,920
you have to keep them in line so if

244
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,440
you're referring to something else it's

245
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,360
better to just leave it alone like if it

246
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,560
says must and the other one we're just

247
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,480
gonna do must here there's no change so

248
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,760
i think that's a good policy yeah

249
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
the second one was about

250
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,160
why we were requiring specifically the

251
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,519
307

252
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,120
error requests for

253
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,600
for performing the load the redirection

254
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,680
and being able to support load balancing

255
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,079
and the reason is that 307 is the only

256
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,240
regulation that ensures proper behavior

257
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,160
with hd peoples

258
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,399
so instead of having a wide branch of

259
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,920
allowing other

260
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,279
error codes

261
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,360
that will not be implemented by clients

262
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,640
anyway so

263
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,440
and does not support hdp posts it is

264
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,279
better to just use

265
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,120
this specific error code

266
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,920
the

267
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,880
second one is the third one is the

268
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,480
the discussion about if we should

269
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,200
support basic on or other

270
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,959
or why we were

271
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,800
like fixing the authentication to use

272
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,200
the very token there was already a

273
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,880
concert about that basic should not be

274
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,279
supported and we have provided

275
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,640
a way how about how to use like a

276
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
username and password or something like

277
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,640
that in in the token uh of the of the

278
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,839
beer header

279
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,399
and anyway if there is any

280
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,480
new authentication method for http we

281
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,120
will have to update with spec anyway so

282
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,440
i mean there is no way that we can be

283
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
future proof here when we don't know how

284
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,640
it will look like

285
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,480
and and so and the next one is the last

286
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,640
one it was about the turns with clients

287
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,959
and with endpoints because in in webrtc

288
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,399
input it typically means one of the two

289
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,320
peer-to-peer

290
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,040
any of the peer-to-peer endpoints

291
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,279
but this is consistent with the rest api

292
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,360
a rest api when the the

293
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,800
the

294
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,440
when it is the end points are are used

295
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
as the entry point for the for the rest

296
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,279
api so i think that this is consistent

297
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,880
with the spirit of the

298
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,720
of the whip protocol and the wind

299
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,440
paintbond endpoint is it is a rest

300
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,760
aimpoint so i think that it is

301
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,040
still correct to use

302
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,320
so anyone who has any issue with not

303
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
facing this feedback

304
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,160
yeah so to be clear like this is the

305
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,360
we're not going to do this we're moving

306
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,639
on because we did work in group last

307
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,160
call so if you object and you really

308
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,360
think one of these changes need to

309
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
happen

310
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
the mic line is open

311
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,920
if not we're going to move on and

312
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,719
consider these closed

313
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,639
going once

314
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,240
going twice

315
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
i don't see anybody in the queue

316
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,639
sold

317
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,160
so next one so this is a

318
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,519
this was a

319
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,320
i have i just put some of the

320
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
of the changes that i have made to the

321
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,880
drop that may have some impact so we'll

322
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,790
like to get some

323
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,040
[Music]

324
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,120
some

325
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
from the group that to approve it

326
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,639
because this was not in the draft that

327
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,480
was a

328
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
in the working group last call so this

329
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,680
is

330
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,279
some changes that i think that will need

331
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,720
consensus in order to be approved

332
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,519
this one is a

333
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,160
what happens if one media server does

334
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,639
only support triglyce but not if stars

335
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,320
or vice versa

336
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,519
so uh i have added here um

337
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,680
in um a change that if any of them if

338
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,160
none of them is supported then then

339
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,839
the patch must return a 405 meaning that

340
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,800
none

341
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,680
and the patch request is not accepted at

342
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,880
all neither for israel restart or or

343
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,399
or tricolize

344
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,040
and if the request is safe from

345
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,199
trigger lice and you only support if

346
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,120
start or vice versa what it is going to

347
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
be in returning the 501 and not

348
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,720
implemented

349
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,399
for the requests that are not supported

350
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,279
so i'm not sure if this is

351
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,199
anyone has any feedback about this or

352
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,399
this is okay for everyone

353
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,760
going once

354
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
it's never going twice in three times

355
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
you can always get object later but like

356
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,279
at this point

357
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,760
this sentiment here is correct

358
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,839
uh sorry adam roach uh i think the

359
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,760
sentiment here is correct the wording i

360
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,519
think uh means a little bit of thing

361
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,880
because the

362
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,519
the phrasing around when to send

363
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
the uh

364
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,920
the 405 is a little bit confusing but i

365
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
think that this is technically the right

366
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,920
way to do it

367
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,959
okay so

368
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,320
sorry you

369
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,839
i mean because

370
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,680
it is difficult for me to just

371
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,360
if it would be great if you could just

372
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,279
write a small pr so we can address it

373
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,320
and

374
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
and then

375
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,880
the concern so

376
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
because i mean i can write it but then i

377
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
will have to go back to you and see if

378
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,079
you think that this is okay so maybe

379
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,839
it's easier if you just can write it

380
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,880
down

381
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,920
that's great and we'll get we'll get

382
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,440
spencer to note that in the draft but

383
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,920
i'm appreciate your input

384
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,600
all right we'll go to the next we'll go

385
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,519
to the next one unless there's any

386
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,760
anybody else no all right

387
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,199
turn stun always a great topic

388
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,600
so

389
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,399
the next one is

390
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,720
what happens or we have included that it

391
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,800
is possible to support

392
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,279
or to return the is created until

393
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,720
in the options

394
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,199
when the clients that no support they

395
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,880
set any configuration

396
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,519
after they

397
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
or changed the conversation until the

398
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,519
local effect has been created

399
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,440
but what happens if the

400
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,279
the question was what happens if the

401
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,040
resources does not require out because

402
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,279
we were requiring that the options

403
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,759
request was one authentic authentication

404
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,120
in order to retrieve the

405
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,040
to provide the and the student already

406
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
and internal credit deals

407
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
and

408
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,360
what i have removed that and then then

409
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,680
that is an authenticated options to be

410
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,399
returned then the

411
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,079
the options request because i think that

412
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,759
it is i mean it is up to the

413
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
implementators to decide when to

414
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,079
to then to

415
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,399
if they want to support options without

416
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,040
a authentication to provide the

417
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
the stone credentialed

418
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,880
but

419
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,680
what i have added is that

420
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,519
the note that

421
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,279
this should not be done for flight

422
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,720
option with request for course

423
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,560
so

424
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,399
and this is the the test that it is

425
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,480
there so this is that that's the spirit

426
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
i hope that it is a

427
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,959
correct the the wording

428
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,759
and according to the into the draft of

429
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,520
course the option request is the one

430
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,280
that does not have the asset control

431
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,439
request with the post value

432
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,839
and i'm not really sure if the last part

433
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,199
of the phrase that the

434
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,959
request having the access control

435
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,559
request header should be

436
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,720
not contain a link value

437
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
this is always the case but i'm not sure

438
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,240
if you can request

439
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,559
an option that will work for both for

440
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
course and for

441
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,839
for

442
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,400
for retrieving the term credentials at

443
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,760
least the process does not support it

444
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,120
but i don't think that we should prevent

445
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,960
this

446
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,520
oh sorry

447
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,320
then you sort of

448
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,080
think and you put the

449
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,000
the

450
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
the slides in full screen because there

451
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
are people that complain that the test

452
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,760
is too small to to

453
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
to watching in the room

454
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
let me see

455
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,240
can i make it go slideshow i will not be

456
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,360
able to see the queue then so that'll

457
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,840
is that better

458
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,840
now

459
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,520
if i do it one more

460
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,200
and then do that is that going to work

461
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,799
oh i think i gotta go 150.

462
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,240
i think that's as big as i can make it

463
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,240
give people a couple minutes to take a

464
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,480
read

465
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,640
these slides are also up in the data

466
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,640
tracker

467
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,120
okay

468
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,960
again i can't see the queue but is there

469
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,840
anybody that uh

470
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,600
go ahead yeah yeah which again sorry i

471
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,080
was i was just like looking at the the

472
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,200
pr i was going to put in here for the um

473
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,360
the

474
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
trickle ice and i support

475
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,880
language for patch

476
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
and actually

477
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,240
the text in here when i went to recraft

478
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,880
it i think it's a little backwards um

479
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,559
the way that reads right now it says

480
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,160
that you return a 501 if you support

481
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,520
trickle ice

482
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080
or ice restarts but not both

483
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
i think that's the 405 situation because

484
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,480
501 means i don't know what this crazy

485
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
patch method is

486
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,799
um

487
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
but i can't handle it

488
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,559
okay so it's the other way around

489
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,080
yes okay i just want to make sure we

490
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,039
weren't dangled on the axle on that

491
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,158
does that sound right to everyone

492
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,720
all right i'll go ahead

493
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
no one's running to the microphone to

494
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,480
object so sounds good all right

495
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,480
thanks

496
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,280
all right i will go to the next slide

497
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,799
then nope jonathan's getting up

498
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,880
uh yeah john max i didn't put myself in

499
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,159
the queue sorry um i guess the only

500
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,159
other thing i'd say is if you support

501
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,480
patch for any other reason

502
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,240
but not these you should still treat it

503
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
as hey i understand what patches but not

504
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,360
this one

505
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,799
even if you don't support either trickle

506
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,760
ice or

507
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,840
ice restart

508
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,960
maybe that's

509
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,400
obvious okay

510
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,000
yeah yeah i think that we should add it

511
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,159
too

512
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,559
so this is a

513
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,439
the um

514
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,080
the the one yes this is uh

515
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,679
i think that there was a

516
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,559
uh

517
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,880
did that from christopher and he

518
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,320
that

519
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,000
he thought that it was a bad idea to go

520
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,799
about the masjid they set setup at pass

521
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:31,600
in

522
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,039
and

523
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,360
we have had a discussion in the hope

524
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,159
issue and he provided this this change

525
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,840
so i think that he's okay with that

526
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,200
change so

527
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
so i think that um

528
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,760
so

529
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,840
the question is say how about the rest

530
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,240
of the group so the the issue is that we

531
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,760
want to support

532
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,799
clients

533
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,600
or

534
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,280
with clients to not have to implement

535
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,320
both

536
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,120
uh at pass and

537
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,360
what not to support at that pass that

538
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,760
means that they have to a attacks and be

539
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,720
able to

540
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,120
handle activity and passive

541
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,799
uh for the

542
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,640
from the depending on what the servers

543
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,799
say

544
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,120
chose but

545
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,559
our idea has been always from the

546
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,400
beginning to be able to lower the

547
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,120
barrier of implementing clients

548
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,159
so we are now supporting that the

549
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,679
the client may

550
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,240
be a send a

551
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,799
set of attribute of active instead of

552
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,120
the ad pass

553
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,080
and we are also in specifying what

554
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,400
should be the the behavior in case that

555
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,960
the server that does not allow that

556
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
julius i see you're in the queue feel

557
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,440
free to come off mute

558
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,360
thanks uh yeah uh hello uh i'm

559
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
sorry but it was actually about the

560
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,280
previous slide

561
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,120
so i'm sorry i missed the opportunity

562
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,039
because i wanted to discuss the other

563
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,960
discussion to finish if you could please

564
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,400
come back to the previous slide

565
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,280
um so my question is is supporting

566
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,240
options in order to get the iserver

567
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,280
still optional

568
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,080
i've just lost cersei

569
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
yeah for some reason i'm having a

570
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,799
complete what the hell moment

571
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,679
this one

572
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,440
sergio if you're speaking i cannot hear

573
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,600
you

574
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,039
am i the only one who lost her troll

575
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,230
um

576
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,499
[Music]

577
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,440
seems to be

578
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,360
he's yeah he's he appears offline right

579
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,880
now

580
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,080
probably some

581
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,159
internet hiccup on his end maybe you go

582
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,159
ahead and do this and still

583
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,080
try to make your point and wait for this

584
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,200
okay so my point is that uh

585
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,320
so

586
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
the

587
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,000
natural thing to work with as far as i

588
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,559
understand the webrtc api the browser

589
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,600
api

590
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,640
what you're doing is that you first

591
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,520
generate an uh you first generate an

592
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,919
offer you apply it to the peer

593
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,520
connection

594
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,440
then you send it to your room to the

595
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,279
server

596
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,080
and by the time when you apply it to the

597
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,480
peer connection you need to know about

598
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,640
your i servers

599
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
so in the proper protocol there are two

600
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,840
ways

601
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
two things that can happen you can

602
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,440
either send the options first in order

603
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
to get the i servers in which case you

604
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,279
do the natural thing

605
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,480
or else you don't do the options

606
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,279
in which case you are applying you need

607
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,400
to send the offer before applying it

608
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,919
which means that there are two different

609
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,720
behaviors from clients for clients

610
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,919
that are

611
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,760
the drab doesn't make any choice between

612
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,440
the two behaviors

613
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,159
and so one of the two behaviors looks

614
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,880
really bad to me in the case in which

615
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,720
the client is on a restrictive network

616
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,840
that only allows outgoing tcp

617
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,880
if you don't put any i servers your it

618
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,279
is not going to work so currently the

619
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,440
draft allows two different behaviors for

620
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,159
clients one of which is going to work

621
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,080
and one one of which might work i know

622
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,600
i'm not sure what the consequences are

623
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,440
of um

624
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,400
sending the uh of sending the offer too

625
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,240
early and the other one which will

626
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,960
simply not work in some cases and i'm

627
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
afraid that that's going to be very

628
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,559
difficult to debug that we are going to

629
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,400
have connectivity issues with some

630
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,720
clients or not others

631
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,880
and i would like the draft to at least

632
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,559
strongly recommend one of the two

633
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,200
behaviors

634
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,159
sergio appears to be back but i'm not

635
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,310
sure if he has like a few cops

636
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,840
[Applause]

637
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,600
there he is he's back

638
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,158
yeah sorry

639
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,000
yeah i'm going to do it again i'll try

640
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,559
to be quicker this time

641
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,080
so

642
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,760
i heard you options are still optional

643
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,600
having the linking options is still

644
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,600
optional

645
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,720
yeah yeah this is optional in fact the

646
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,919
whole student tool support is optional

647
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,240
so what happens if we have clients and

648
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,480
restrictive networks that only allow

649
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,279
outgoing tcp

650
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,279
it will not work i mean but but you

651
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,880
cannot for anyone to support this to

652
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,440
nanturn i mean same as you you can force

653
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,279
anyone to in webrtc to support stu

654
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,799
nantun no what i mean is that if i am

655
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,799
the server maintainer

656
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,760
i do provide a turn server that i know

657
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,120
does work for my client population

658
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,000
right

659
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,240
in this case there is no way i can

660
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,880
guarantee that all clients will be using

661
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,840
it

662
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,520
so i'm going to have some clients

663
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,240
working some clients not working

664
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,039
and that's going to be help to debug

665
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,559
and help to explain to your users

666
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,970
[Music]

667
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,600
do you want to to to

668
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,760
to

669
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,640
uh

670
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,320
to mandate that the client support one

671
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,360
of both

672
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,279
i want

673
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,000
i want the recommended configuration it

674
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,679
doesn't need to be a must but it should

675
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,240
be at least strongly recommended

676
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
i want the default to be that any turn

677
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,320
servers that are that i provide

678
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,840
are being used by the client

679
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,679
i don't think that it is even

680
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,279
enforceable i mean because the client

681
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,799
might choose to

682
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,840
to to use a different of course but if a

683
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,799
different one so

684
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,279
doesn't give enough guidance to the

685
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,600
client implementers i'm assuming here

686
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,360
that the client implementers are acting

687
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,760
in good faith and that if we give a

688
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
strong recommendation they will follow

689
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,880
it unless they get i mean i mean i i

690
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
don't think that we have an itf policy

691
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,600
so i mean we have a lot of mass in the

692
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,120
draft that are never implemented so

693
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,080
putting a mask here is not going to help

694
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,840
anyway so but any anyway

695
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,480
giving implementation guidance to

696
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,679
implementers cannot be a bad thing

697
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,320
and so the use case of having the

698
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,200
clients behind a restrictive network is

699
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,679
something that is important in my world

700
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,159
okay in academia most networks are

701
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,880
extremely especially student networks

702
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
are very restrictive tcp is the only

703
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,799
thing that has a good thing about that

704
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,640
yeah i know i get it i get it but i try

705
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,480
to be let's try to be fast because we

706
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,919
have only two minutes more for

707
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,520
discussing so

708
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,799
what would be your suggestion

709
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,640
my suggestion would be to mandate that

710
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,360
the cl to to make options on the server

711
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,559
side

712
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,720
support for providing turn servers on

713
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,159
the server side a must

714
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,799
no because

715
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,760
sorry sorry go ahead

716
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,840
sorry

717
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,320
so uh i would so what i would like would

718
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,679
be to have to provide to make it

719
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,000
compulsory for servers to implement

720
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,200
providing

721
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,000
i servers before the peer connection is

722
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
created

723
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,880
before the initial offer is sent

724
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,919
and

725
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,000
making it should

726
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,039
that the client should use the the i

727
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,240
servers provided by the server

728
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,960
i mean we cannot mandate the servers to

729
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,919
implement

730
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,760
the or to use tune because i mean it is

731
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,279
i mean there are a lot of servers that

732
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,880
will not have to

733
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,039
to have a tool server

734
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,039
so if you want your service to support

735
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,880
tune i mean it's okay for you but we

736
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,760
cannot mandate everyone to support or to

737
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,399
require two servers in order to

738
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,840
run

739
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,600
to run a web server so we can add the

740
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
client should support

741
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,480
and

742
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,240
some of the configuration but we cannot

743
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
mandate that the media servers always

744
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,120
send a to a server configuration okay so

745
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,399
if the server is providing

746
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,600
i servers in the answer then it must

747
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,480
provide the same i servers and an option

748
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,399
before

749
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,080
does that formulation suit you better

750
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,399
and how

751
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,320
now for example i will not

752
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,799
i'll i probably will not support that

753
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,320
in my servers and i don't think that

754
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,559
because i don't want to

755
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,960
because for in my case creating and

756
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,760
so could you please outline so i've

757
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,080
asked it on i think it was on github or

758
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
in the mailing list i don't recall could

759
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
you please outline

760
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,480
what happens if the server is providing

761
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,159
a working turn server but the client

762
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,640
is behind a restrictive network

763
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,200
is that a case where

764
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,080
we give up english are we saying that

765
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,519
the case of clients that are on

766
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,279
restrictive networks

767
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,600
is not something for which which is

768
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,360
suitable

769
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,960
no it is suitable and we have solution

770
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,039
for it that what we cannot do is mandate

771
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,559
to have support in the server so

772
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,399
but i control the server i do not

773
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,640
control the client population

774
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,559
the reason which is interesting is that

775
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,880
various clients are going to work and

776
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,440
here you are not mandating a uniform

777
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,760
behavior across all clients

778
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,679
so i'm going to have my network work

779
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,200
with some clients but not others

780
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,039
so we have adam and cullen in the line i

781
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,000
don't know if they were going to make a

782
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,880
point

783
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,480
i'm

784
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,320
um adam are you on this point as well

785
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,360
i i am yeah well it's long time to

786
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,760
unmute

787
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
go ahead

788
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,120
adam so

789
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,240
um

790
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,840
the

791
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,000
the point that was raised on the list

792
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,399
that i recall is that

793
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,480
it may require

794
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
actual acquisition of resources to

795
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,960
provide these urls and under those

796
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,399
circumstances

797
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,720
it isn't realistic for a server to be

798
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,120
able to provide a response in options

799
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,480
because it's not certain that it's going

800
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,799
to be able to like authenticate and put

801
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,919
this request through it doesn't want to

802
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,679
allocate resources for that and i'm

803
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,320
sympathetic to that position i think we

804
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,840
probably want to do

805
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,399
is highlight for implementers that this

806
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,919
is an edge that might catch clients out

807
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,840
and make them aware that if this

808
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,159
situation appears to be occurring they

809
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,080
should alert the user that something's

810
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,240
going on at least for the purpose of

811
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,840
making it easier to operate these

812
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,760
networks because i also understand the

813
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,519
point that julius is raising here where

814
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,279
just operationally deploying these sorts

815
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,440
of things where the client silently fail

816
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,480
is going to be painful

817
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,879
cola

818
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,120
um

819
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,640
i mean i keep hearing that we can't

820
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,600
mandate that the servers do x i i don't

821
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,960
have an opinion on whether they should

822
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,200
or should not do x but i think we could

823
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,880
mandate that there's nothing stopping us

824
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,080
from doing that if that was what the

825
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,159
working group wanted to do right and we

826
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,559
do that lots of other places and anytime

827
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,399
you have something that's like a fully

828
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,120
compliant client can't operate with a

829
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,799
fully compliant server and they're not

830
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,240
going to work on a network condition

831
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,480
that occurs broadly all over the place

832
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,399
that's never a great situation for me

833
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,640
like so i'm sort of sympathetic to

834
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,000
trying to uh

835
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,039
you know

836
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,039
have protocols and obviously if we say

837
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,599
you know you must do codec y it doesn't

838
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,520
mean anyone won't just ignore that code

839
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,119
that thing but at least when that

840
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,560
happens you can say like look you're no

841
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,320
longer implementing the spec and that's

842
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,000
why it doesn't interoperate so i don't

843
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,199
know i'm just pushing back a little bit

844
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,719
on the saying we can't do this i think

845
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,320
we could do this whether we should do

846
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,679
this or not i have no idea of what the

847
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,359
right answer is but i think we could

848
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,918
mandate it

849
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,480
yeah but for example

850
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,239
may i still

851
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,560
so basically what i see right now in the

852
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,639
current draft are three different client

853
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,239
behaviors

854
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,079
you can either well four but one doesn't

855
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,960
make sense you can either do the options

856
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,918
to get the i servers or not to do it

857
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,320
and you can either do the offer before

858
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,800
you apply it or after you apply it and

859
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,159
that will have

860
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,918
different consequences and different

861
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,639
things about ice servers and candidates

862
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,880
so i see three different behaviors for

863
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,000
clients

864
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,920
and that worries me because they will

865
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,320
behave differently and they will cause

866
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,800
operational problems i would really like

867
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,839
it if we could at least strongly

868
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,079
recommend one of the three possible

869
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,440
behaviors having three different

870
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
behaviors for clients is going to be

871
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,240
absolute help to debug

872
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,200
well

873
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,640
i would say that

874
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,240
we have added

875
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,320
and optional behaviors because they are

876
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,839
clients that are not implementing the

877
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,359
specs

878
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,280
so

879
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,280
said configuration and said yeah and

880
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,720
i mean

881
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,040
is something that it is supported by the

882
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,640
by the spec and

883
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,839
so

884
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,359
anyway so

885
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,359
uh

886
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,839
i'm trying to move this forward and try

887
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,440
to find what is

888
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,160
the

889
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,079
the solution for this

890
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,440
i mean i'm

891
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,640
i'm okay afraid of uh of putting that

892
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,280
the client should use the

893
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,800
the

894
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,839
the turn servers provided by the

895
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,079
by by the

896
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,160
by the web server either in the options

897
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,599
or in the

898
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,880
in the link

899
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,440
i'm also okay saying that the media

900
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,560
servers should provide the

901
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,720
in case they support two servers they

902
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,400
should probably should provide it in

903
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,720
both the options and in the

904
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,040
and in the http post what i would be

905
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,119
against is to mandate to support on the

906
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,480
on the media server

907
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,640
and also to mandate or to require that

908
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,280
the the clients who has to specifically

909
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,560
use the

910
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,119
then the two servers provided to in

911
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,079
order to

912
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,000
to work because they could they could be

913
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,680
cases in which

914
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,520
the companies has a local tool server

915
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,200
for whatever and they want to use it

916
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,960
because to bypass the

917
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,000
the

918
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,160
the

919
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,359
the

920
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,280
the firewall because you have the

921
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,680
network servicing at the dmc and you

922
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,280
just connect everyone to the into the

923
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,200
twin server to avoid to have to open

924
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,079
your

925
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,720
uh the firewall to everyone so i think

926
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,680
that

927
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,640
it is not a good idea to to force to the

928
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,320
requirement to use

929
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,560
and then the two servers provided for in

930
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,880
order to work

931
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,440
would it be helpful if i described in

932
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,079
detail the three behaviors i read in the

933
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,920
current draft on the mailing list

934
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,880
so

935
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,200
that you can decide whether you wish to

936
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,520
mandate one specific behavior

937
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,599
would that be helpful search

938
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,359
yeah yeah let's continue the discussion

939
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,280
on the mailing list i try to agree on

940
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,119
what because we are running out of time

941
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,440
so let's try to keep that so let's keep

942
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
this open and and this and finish the

943
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,760
discussion on the mailing list

944
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,359
yeah so just to be clear

945
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,640
the whole point is to get through the

946
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,320
working group last call comment so we'll

947
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,000
we'll take this time we'll take up the

948
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,160
future conversation we'll we'll just

949
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,079
shorten that a little bit

950
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,480
so all right let's go to the next one

951
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,160
why does this not want to work what is

952
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,079
my laptop doing

953
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,680
stab next nope it doesn't like that one

954
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,119
passive setup it finally went sorry

955
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,800
there we go

956
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
yeah

957
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,079
so

958
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,880
uh so we have rewarded it too

959
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,200
then to to change the

960
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,960
the the wording so we recommend that the

961
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,560
the the

962
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,480
the preferred option is to follow then

963
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,200
the

964
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,000
rcc57c3 to

965
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,599
turn to

966
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,160
an attack an ad pass

967
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,119
attribute and only

968
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,440
in case that the endpoint

969
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,839
it does not support a setting then

970
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,320
setting it it can

971
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,520
and

972
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,760
just choose to to send an update but it

973
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,359
is not a guarantee that it will work

974
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,400
and

975
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,760
so and also we have added a note about

976
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,200
why this

977
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
is a different behavior than what it is

978
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,760
specified in the in the rpc because the

979
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,839
idea is the media service always

980
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,000
to support them because it's a media

981
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,079
server so it is easier to implement both

982
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,440
the media server and the client

983
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,320
going once

984
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,040
going twice

985
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,920
sold all right sounds good i think this

986
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,520
is a good way forward actually because

987
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,760
you you change you you change it and he

988
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,040
said he should and if you're not going

989
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
to do the it tells you why and what

990
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,119
happens so that's good

991
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,839
all right come on laptop what is going

992
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,078
on

993
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,480
the next one so

994
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,000
yeah i servers there we go

995
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,240
so this is a then

996
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,119
about how in the end they offer the so

997
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,400
to specify

998
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,000
a bit more what is the

999
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,800
the

1000
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,520
expected behavior to avoid having to to

1001
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,000
create a nice restart

1002
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,680
because it is what is happening for

1003
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,119
example in the browsers

1004
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,960
so the idea is that then that

1005
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,079
that

1006
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,520
this is

1007
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,880
the way that

1008
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,800
i have added a note that depending on

1009
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,400
the ice implementation because it is not

1010
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,160
really specified when they

1011
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,520
when the the the phase should be started

1012
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,880
it's obviously not after the before the

1013
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,520
in the so in order to prevent the

1014
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,839
restart there may be some cases when you

1015
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,280
need to apply the in the local

1016
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,359
description after a

1017
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,520
applying the set configuration is not

1018
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,560
just yes when after getting the offer

1019
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,920
and creating a

1020
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,800
and doing the post with it

1021
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,720
so this is just a note specifying that

1022
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,760
it is a

1023
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,480
what may be

1024
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,240
required by the implementation so it

1025
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,720
does not change the spec in any way

1026
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,640
and as julius says this is the the the

1027
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,200
issue that about the client behavior on

1028
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,800
on the

1029
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,319
unrestricted nat

1030
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,079
is what we are going also to discuss in

1031
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,160
the mailing list to see if we can

1032
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,760
put some

1033
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,800
more

1034
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,880
texts explained in

1035
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,560
the scenarios and so

1036
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,599
it will be just more informative about

1037
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,880
what could happen if in these cases and

1038
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,040
it will not change the way that the web

1039
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,000
perspective will work

1040
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,920
going once

1041
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,240
going twice and one thing that is this

1042
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,079
pr was missing in the draft zero seven

1043
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,240
but because i just

1044
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,480
thought that it was in but then the

1045
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,160
issue was not handled so i have had it

1046
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,319
and it is in the new in the main branch

1047
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,560
now

1048
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,280
okay great

1049
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,000
uh sorry what does the going once going

1050
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,280
twice mean

1051
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,800
does it mean that we agree with the

1052
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,560
current wording

1053
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,599
so i'm i'd like to know that

1054
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,480
that

1055
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,560
no one has any other concern that the

1056
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,400
that the one that we have so it is not

1057
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,560
that that is that we will continue

1058
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,160
discussing this in the mailing list

1059
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,919
so next light please

1060
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,640
it's the strangest thing it will not

1061
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,480
progress

1062
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,280
what is going on

1063
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,839
local problem

1064
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,640
me all right

1065
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,800
so this is the the case what that and

1066
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,839
specifying what will be the the

1067
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,440
behavior if uh

1068
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,000
if a client send more than one audio on

1069
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,119
video track or more than one stream

1070
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,800
so we don't have currently anything in

1071
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,319
the in the

1072
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,560
in the graphics fourth into just one

1073
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,839
audio on or video track

1074
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,119
so

1075
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,720
and currently we have just leave the

1076
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,440
the implementation a bit open about what

1077
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,079
would the the server be expecting

1078
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,400
so this is a trying to address a bit

1079
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,920
more um

1080
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,240
there is an area in which the client

1081
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,599
sends something that then that the

1082
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,599
server is not expecting

1083
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,119
this could happen if for example if you

1084
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,960
are sending multiple audio tracks and

1085
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,800
then server does not support it because

1086
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,560
it will not probably be supported by

1087
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,160
anyone so

1088
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,880
the

1089
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,680
the what we have described here is that

1090
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,720
the

1091
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,040
the post should be registered with a 406

1092
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,000
no not a stable error code

1093
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,280
this could happen um

1094
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,760
not only in case the that the audio that

1095
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,079
the client sends multiple audio video

1096
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,760
tracks or multiple streams but it may

1097
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,079
happen also in if for example the the

1098
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,400
client sensor

1099
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,119
audio on video stream but the media is

1100
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,640
already expecting an audio only

1101
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,000
so

1102
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,760
what i have a data note that it is

1103
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,560
better to fail that just added partially

1104
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
they offered and by rejecting some of

1105
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,359
the individual assets because

1106
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,119
it will be much more difficult to

1107
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,280
identify for the clients

1108
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,760
and also will be much more

1109
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,640
and

1110
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,079
i think that the proper behavior should

1111
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,240
be that the client stops

1112
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,280
and sending the the the stream because i

1113
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,760
mean the the the user may

1114
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,520
may expect that the audience video works

1115
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,440
and and only video works and if they are

1116
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,280
sending multiple audio tracks they would

1117
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,160
expect that all works so just having a

1118
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,079
state that it is partial success i don't

1119
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,440
think that it is the best thing to have

1120
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,319
in a

1121
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,800
in a spec so we started projecting the

1122
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
individual insertions that the the

1123
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,880
server does not support it is preferable

1124
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,880
to just reject the hold

1125
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,920
and the whole thing

1126
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,359
thanks um

1127
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,000
so i think this is an okay

1128
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,280
behavior at a high level uh the 406

1129
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
response isn't quite right that's used

1130
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,200
for content negotiation

1131
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,599
um and it's not a semantic match for

1132
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,640
this

1133
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,680
uh

1134
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,440
i'm gonna have to dig in and see what we

1135
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,240
might use the better 422 might work i'm

1136
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,960
gonna have to go and check the formal

1137
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,240
definition of that

1138
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,160
this might end up just being a 400 if

1139
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,359
we're going to be

1140
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,440
compliant with http

1141
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,640
okay so yes if you can you can send me

1142
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,400
what do you think it is the best server

1143
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,560
code because i think that it is one of

1144
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,400
the most difficult things right now is

1145
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,079
try to map the rush to the actual level

1146
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,880
of http error codes

1147
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,200
right yeah that's that's always tricky

1148
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,119
that's the that's why we have an entire

1149
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,040
draft about how to

1150
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,680
map applications on http

1151
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,720
yeah

1152
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,359
jonathan yeah um i guess two points one

1153
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,280
this makes me a little nervous because

1154
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,480
this is

1155
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,240
very much not the back compatibility

1156
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,040
model that offer answer or uses

1157
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,920
which means that i'm worried that some

1158
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,160
future extensions might end up

1159
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,880
being hard to deploy because you have

1160
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,880
this mismatch here i can't think of

1161
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,119
anything concrete but i guess my other

1162
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,839
question is how is i mean not having

1163
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,319
read the entire draft in a while

1164
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,680
does the

1165
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,000
client know how many like

1166
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,520
it's concretely like

1167
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,200
is the client have a way to know that

1168
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,280
the server is expecting audio only this

1169
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,800
is a podcasting grass not a video

1170
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,920
ingress

1171
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,280
and how does the client know what gem

1172
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,200
lines to send

1173
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
i would expect that this is something

1174
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,880
that you can have it on your

1175
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,440
configuration i mean when you

1176
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,960
you are sending to

1177
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,319
youtube you know that this supports

1178
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,079
audio video if you are sending for

1179
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,920
example to cliffhouse you know that it

1180
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,760
is sending to audi only so it is

1181
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,000
something that i think that should be

1182
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,640
kind of expected to be known in in

1183
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,640
in

1184
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,960
at configuration time so that's why i

1185
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,800
think that it is better to fail

1186
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,000
completely

1187
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,079
uh that's to indicate that it is

1188
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,920
something that something is going wrong

1189
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,200
that just to

1190
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,440
partially work so they the clients that

1191
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,560
don't know what is going on

1192
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,800
all right um yeah i guess

1193
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,319
i mean maybe this would be a

1194
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,599
if this turns out to be a pain point in

1195
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,720
the future we may have to add a

1196
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,920
configuration for that but that's

1197
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,280
probably okay it's probably for that

1198
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,440
yeah

1199
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,960
i would expect that

1200
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,359
that in the future we will have to like

1201
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,720
have some

1202
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,480
something up to they get

1203
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,079
so the people so the clients can

1204
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,920
actually have like

1205
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
they have a get request to their

1206
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,079
resources so they can have like

1207
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,920
more information about what's going on

1208
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,839
about the station

1209
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,920
and that's supported nothing like that

1210
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,760
so i think that this will be solving

1211
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,359
this will be part of any future

1212
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,839
extension

1213
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,140
all right we'll go to the next one

1214
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,250
[Music]

1215
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,119
okay and this is a

1216
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,640
trying to solve the issue with the

1217
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,400
ayanna

1218
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,040
it is a

1219
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,839
a

1220
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,280
new superspace

1221
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,640
for existing

1222
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,350
new parameters in in

1223
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,839
[Music]

1224
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,440
in in

1225
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,800
to register

1226
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,920
to create a new a register in the

1227
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,400
in the

1228
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,559
in the urine super space for for

1229
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,160
protocol parameters

1230
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,400
and this is a change a bit about the

1231
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,440
format

1232
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,359
that the other of the

1233
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,280
extensions and i have added the

1234
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,520
yeah i have followed

1235
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,880
one example that

1236
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,640
i think that there was a zip or

1237
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,160
something like that

1238
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,240
and tried to copy paste everything i

1239
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,760
think that i have missed something

1240
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,200
because i have seen something in the

1241
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,359
comments so i will review it and

1242
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,559
and ask for feedback in the email about

1243
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,559
how if

1244
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,800
what is the best if anything is missing

1245
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,200
if how do i need to to solve it but the

1246
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,400
idea is to

1247
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,880
to add a new register so

1248
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,599
we can when we define new extensions we

1249
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,160
can add the extension to that register

1250
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,520
in the in the in ayanna

1251
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,559
all right i think there's no discussion

1252
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,760
on that point

1253
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,200
that was an email you actually got from

1254
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,640
myanna right there because they're being

1255
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,520
proactive

1256
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,359
yeah yeah they are monitoring all the

1257
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,920
drafts that are being submitted to and

1258
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,599
they saw my draft and and

1259
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,359
luckily discover that this issue

1260
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,359
yeah

1261
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:37,119
so next steps uh i will well we have one

1262
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,040
necessity that it is a

1263
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,760
final and or

1264
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,119
getting or solving first day and the the

1265
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,359
error codes and some working

1266
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,040
that will provide

1267
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,280
also we have to discuss

1268
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,839
the issue that julius has

1269
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,880
pointed out about the

1270
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,720
the different

1271
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,720
configurations and different behaviors

1272
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,680
of the

1273
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,280
eyes

1274
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,280
of the i say

1275
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,000
of the i servers

1276
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,440
then we will need to update the drop

1277
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,440
based on the on the feedback

1278
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,079
and publish probably sees with the with

1279
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,400
the benefits and not surely we need to

1280
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,880
do working group last call again due to

1281
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,160
the number of changes or if we just say

1282
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,680
yeah so i haven't i haven't talked with

1283
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,680
meals my personal opinion is that we

1284
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,520
should because we're changing must uh

1285
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,400
2119 relative language the only thing is

1286
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
i'm trying to be practical is when do

1287
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,160
you think we can get the changes done

1288
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,839
and get a new draft because there there

1289
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,040
are parts of the world that go on

1290
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,880
vacation for like august

1291
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,680
so yeah and i'm not sure yeah like you

1292
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,760
right so i want to make sure that we're

1293
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,359
being reasonable like hey give it to me

1294
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,800
next week and i start a working group

1295
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
last call and no one's reading it so

1296
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,680
yeah

1297
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,520
i would love to kill yourself and we'll

1298
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,760
maybe we'll shoot for another version

1299
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,440
sometime early september and we shoot

1300
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,720
for another working group last call

1301
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,240
sometime in september does that sound

1302
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,040
good

1303
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,359
if we can have the in the discussion in

1304
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,559
the in the

1305
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,440
in the email done during this week and

1306
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,480
this week i can provide a draft lately

1307
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,319
next week so we can do a working group

1308
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,359
classical

1309
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,880
but it depends on we can agree on

1310
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,319
something on the on the mailing list

1311
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,319
about the depending issue

1312
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,720
i'll be optimistic and say we can

1313
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,240
because that's what's been going on so

1314
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,200
that would be great if we can get

1315
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,880
another if we can get people to submit

1316
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,319
comments uh

1317
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,880
um on the proposed changes and the keep

1318
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,240
the discussion going on this i think we

1319
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,599
can move it forward

1320
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,040
all right so we've got about 10 minutes

1321
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,359
left so thank you very much sergio

1322
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,200
um one of the big questions that we have

1323
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,440
is that this dr this working group has a

1324
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,000
chartered item a chartered item and we

1325
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,839
are very much closing in on getting done

1326
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,559
with that item what do we do

1327
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,559
um so the question is you know we could

1328
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,000
look at extensions and look at other

1329
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,520
things and sergio has some ideas he's

1330
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,640
actually got a whole slide deck in

1331
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,040
another draft and the question is do we

1332
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,720
do this in this working group or do we

1333
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,800
go back to dispatch do we go somewhere

1334
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,599
else

1335
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,599
what's the feeling for the working group

1336
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,640
and the appetite for getting things done

1337
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,920
and it's kind of an open floor

1338
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,200
discussion and if we don't have anything

1339
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,359
to say then sergio's got some slides so

1340
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,960
i'm curious what people what people

1341
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,200
think

1342
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,079
adam you're first in line

1343
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,160
so my my personal take on this is i

1344
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,680
think we want to go ahead and get whip

1345
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,880
out there in the field get some

1346
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,000
practical experience before we um

1347
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,240
go down the path of trying to find other

1348
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,720
things in this space

1349
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,359
um i i'm kind of agnostic about whether

1350
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,319
that means putting wish into a

1351
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,400
dormant state or running things through

1352
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,839
dispatch again

1353
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,720
or you know finding some other home

1354
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,440
but i think that just in terms of the

1355
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,520
amount of energy that we've seen

1356
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,640
in wish

1357
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,400
so far

1358
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,880
we should probably go ahead and get

1359
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,559
like i said some experience around the

1360
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:53,920
protocol

1361
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,359
before we try to take another thing on

1362
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,280
this group i just don't see it moving

1363
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,400
forward

1364
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,839
very quickly at the moment

1365
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,160
okay

1366
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,680
anybody else

1367
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,839
sergio you have some opinions

1368
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,280
yeah i think in terms of the extensions

1369
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,440
if to the web protocol i think that i

1370
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,000
have some some in mind but i agree that

1371
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,520
i think that we should get a bit more

1372
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,000
experience in deploying the the

1373
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,839
the the protocol right now than to get

1374
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,359
feedback before trying to to address

1375
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,119
them so

1376
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,359
i'm not sure if

1377
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,920
we should say leave the

1378
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,760
well a part of the the web draft that i

1379
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,839
will going to to present in a minute i'm

1380
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,680
not sure if

1381
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,520
that we should wait a bit for the final

1382
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,680
web extension until the rfc is open and

1383
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,920
we see more implementation in the wild

1384
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,200
to see what

1385
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,440
gathered new requirements for the

1386
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,640
for the

1387
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,480
for the

1388
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,079
for the extension before doing them

1389
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,160
okay so i'm here and if we're gonna do

1390
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,079
it we can maybe do a working group last

1391
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,359
call and then everybody will be okay

1392
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,720
with like just kind of going dormant

1393
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,319
which is basically means we wouldn't

1394
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,079
meet the next session if we get or the

1395
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,960
next ietf meeting um if we

1396
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,480
are able to get through the working last

1397
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,319
call documents to get this to the isg

1398
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,000
and are able to review it and we would

1399
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,240
meet obviously if we had uh to deal with

1400
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,800
any isg comments um

1401
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,319
and we'll see

1402
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,480
that's perfectly acceptable all right so

1403
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,200
we do have like six minutes you did have

1404
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,720
another set of slides and so i think

1405
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,559
we're gonna

1406
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,559
we're gonna we're gonna uh let you

1407
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,079
indulge yourself in some additional

1408
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,800
slides and so go ahead

1409
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,280
yeah please see if you can oops

1410
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,960
open there and then

1411
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,200
nessa slide

1412
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,119
all right so let's go to that one

1413
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,440
all right

1414
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,520
why is it not sharing stop sharing go

1415
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,839
after reshare okay yeah yeah

1416
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,599
screen track closed sorry about that

1417
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,720
so i should be able to go

1418
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,880
share screen share my screen share the

1419
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,000
other one i'm already doing it

1420
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:00,480
do you really want to share your screen

1421
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,000
i do want to share my screen now it's

1422
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,920
going to ask me what i want to do

1423
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,920
i cannot believe i'm having you guys see

1424
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,359
anything

1425
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,359
nope

1426
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,440
all right well

1427
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,760
anyway i think that even we have a five

1428
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,440
minutes we will start so a web is say

1429
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,560
then

1430
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,790
[Music]

1431
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,720
dance has been

1432
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,200
working on during the the last

1433
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,119
weeks i mean it has been very less

1434
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,640
recent but we

1435
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,880
wanted to present it here to get the

1436
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,359
feedback from the room and asking how

1437
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,559
could be the

1438
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,880
the best way forward

1439
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,160
so chen is also here in the in the

1440
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,839
in the room so jenny do you want to to

1441
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,240
also speak about what is the

1442
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,079
your feeling and what do you think that

1443
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,880
a web is important for the for for you

1444
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,160
okay hello

1445
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,599
hi hello

1446
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,920
hi yeah yeah this is uh

1447
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,359
uh from uh by rt uh from by dance

1448
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,839
uh actually yeah by dance has built one

1449
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:13,280
of the biggest artistic platform uh in

1450
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,400
the

1451
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,359
world we call it by rtc

1452
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,079
and to prove to improve the service

1453
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,400
quality and the stability and achieve

1454
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,960
the best at user experiences we are

1455
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,920
looking for integration with other rtc

1456
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,040
platforms

1457
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,920
just like how we integrate the content

1458
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,440
delivery network platform but

1459
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,000
unfortunately

1460
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
there's no existing way without

1461
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,839
integrating sdk so thanks weep and it

1462
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,960
resolved the ingress problem to resolve

1463
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,160
the egress problem the web was drafted

1464
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,040
so thanks itf for the chance to present

1465
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,720
and discuss it

1466
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,839
hope weep and web can help the companies

1467
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,000
which are meeting the same problems as

1468
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,880
us

1469
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,119
so medical and the bidens are working on

1470
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,720
the poc now so hopefully we can approve

1471
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,480
all the draft

1472
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,160
yeah thank you

1473
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,000
okay so

1474
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,359
so as

1475
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,000
john juan has already said i mean

1476
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,559
even if aggress is outside of the scope

1477
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,640
of the with working group right now i

1478
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,200
think we have reused almost all the

1479
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,920
mechanisms and that we have to pay them

1480
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,400
in place for whip so this is what

1481
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,359
with

1482
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,240
what sorry go one slide before because

1483
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,760
if not i

1484
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,119
one is like

1485
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,599
okay so the the draft that we have

1486
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,359
brought written is basically replaced

1487
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,200
with fro for web

1488
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,520
and that's all that was required to to

1489
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,559
be done

1490
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,680
i mean

1491
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,799
so

1492
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,640
the so

1493
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,000
so the first is way web as jin and as a

1494
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,240
junior already said is

1495
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,040
we think that it is a good way of having

1496
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,599
integrative interoperability between the

1497
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,079
different webrtc service provider so it

1498
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,599
is not as

1499
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,680
a sweep that it was like having more

1500
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,680
clients

1501
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,440
or being able to use

1502
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,000
media from more

1503
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,880
for for for a wider range of tools this

1504
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,520
is could be more useful being able to

1505
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,599
integrate different service providers

1506
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,680
in an interpretable way without having

1507
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,160
to implement custom codes to customers

1508
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,160
sorry custom protocols

1509
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,920
this could be also used to

1510
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,920
and to have like

1511
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,839
common player software that could be

1512
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,400
easily integrated without having to

1513
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,160
to

1514
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,640
to integrate the sdk so having to do any

1515
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,920
kind of

1516
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,760
javascript programming i think that it

1517
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,680
is very important for some kind of

1518
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,799
devices like for example like tvs

1519
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,160
because in tvs you cannot typically or

1520
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,040
it is

1521
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,559
when you have like for example

1522
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,040
impeccable other same things supported

1523
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,280
when you have have the the native player

1524
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,680
of the of the tv playing uh

1525
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,799
um

1526
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,960
a video but you can not have that for

1527
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,480
webrtc

1528
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,079
and also this has already been some

1529
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:06,079
conversation on going in in

1530
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,079
about having to how to integrate the

1531
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,880
impact das with webrtc and being able to

1532
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,720
provide for example ah

1533
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,040
a mixed experience where you can have

1534
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,440
um the the user being able to switch

1535
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,920
between a live webrtc stream and a time

1536
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,920
shifted version of it to for example to

1537
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,960
start watching the event from the

1538
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,520
beginning without that you can fall back

1539
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,160
to impact us for that and so on

1540
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,599
so i think that this would be also

1541
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,079
interesting for that

1542
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:32,880
uh

1543
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,960
so well the question is if we should

1544
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,720
register with working group to include

1545
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,319
digress or we should do something else

1546
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:41,040
so necessary so i can

1547
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,400
easily

1548
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,000
yeah so

1549
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,359
the idea is

1550
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,960
i mean this

1551
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,119
just replacing with for web and the idea

1552
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,359
is exactly the same so you then we play

1553
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,799
as an http post with sap to the endpoint

1554
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,720
the input there returns the answer and

1555
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,079
we

1556
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,720
um create and then the request and

1557
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,720
respond so everything is set up and we

1558
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,520
can delete it in with uh

1559
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,079
within our an sdp delete so this is

1560
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,000
really similar this one please

1561
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,119
we have added a different uh

1562
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,240
option because there are some

1563
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:18,960
a

1564
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,440
first there are some webrtc

1565
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,280
implementation especially for example

1566
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,680
unity that does not support doing great

1567
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,359
offer so it is it's strange but

1568
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,359
it is what it is

1569
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,119
and also for example it will allow to

1570
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,960
avoid to set up another ambition session

1571
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,520
when only audio is supported so the idea

1572
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,839
is to sorry i have jumped

1573
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:43,119
to send and

1574
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,599
i think that they have

1575
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:46,480
the

1576
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,200
no the the graph here is wrong the idea

1577
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,480
would be to do an empty http post

1578
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,920
with a

1579
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,000
an empty http purpose

1580
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,480
so on the so the web endpoint returns

1581
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,240
the http offer

1582
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,480
and then the the web players sends the

1583
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,839
the answer in an http patch

1584
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:08,160
so forget about what is this

1585
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,000
yeah unfortunately we've run out of time

1586
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,920
unfortunately so um

1587
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,920
uh i guess we we can take this this

1588
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,000
discussion to the mailing list

1589
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,720
