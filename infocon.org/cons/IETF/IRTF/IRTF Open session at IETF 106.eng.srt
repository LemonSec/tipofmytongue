1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,230
I guess we should get started

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,830
to speak a little bit of confusion about

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,380
the rooms this is the padang room this

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,180
is the IRT F open meeting if you're

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:30,299
looking for the Collier room you should

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:32,580
be next door okay so this is the ITF

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,790
open meeting my name is Colin Perkins

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:39,030
and the ITF chair there should be blue

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,860
sheets circulating shortly please make

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:46,890
sure you sign in a reminder that the the

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,230
usual I RTF intellectual property

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,020
disclosure rules apply to this meeting I

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,538
know as with the ietf sessions if you

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,239
have if you know of IPR related to the

15
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,719
to the discussion when you're making a

16
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,809
contribution you need to disclose that

17
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:07,160
in addition I'd like to remind you that

18
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:10,590
this meeting will be being recorded and

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:14,119
the recording will be made public and

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:24,869
that we have a code of conduct and

21
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:27,119
please with others participating also

22
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,090
I'd like to remind you that this is an

23
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,320
IRT F and internet research task force

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,950
session

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,110
and I remind that the IRT F is focused

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,270
on longer term research issues and will

27
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,750
discuss more of this later in this

28
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,850
session but unlike the ITF sessions

29
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,130
which are happening this week this is a

30
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,229
research group it is not a standards

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,199
development organization yeah we're

32
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,658
doing research here under standards and

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,219
if you're not familiar with the the

34
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,450
difference between the IRT F and the

35
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:04,500
IETF and RFC 74 18 is a really nice

36
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:07,140
primer for new I new participants in the

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,680
8 RT F who have been used to the IETF

38
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,680
process

39
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:18,370
we have a number of ways in which you

40
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,579
could keep yourself informed about the

41
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,189
IRT F we've got the IRT F dog web page

42
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:26,079
which lists information about all the

43
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:30,909
research groups about all the other

44
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:33,159
activities we do here we have Facebook

45
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:34,900
and Twitter accounts that the Twitter

46
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,090
account is perhaps a more active than

47
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,420
the Facebook page but we have them and

48
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,400
feel free to follow us on social media

49
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,260
if that's your thing we also have

50
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
mailing lists for those who like things

51
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:55,060
more old-school please subscribe to the

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:58,870
lists so yeah IRT F is comprised of a

53
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:02,019
number of research groups we have 14

54
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,769
research groups in the IRT F of which 13

55
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:07,389
of them are meeting this week that the

56
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,040
den RG group is not meeting the

57
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:12,549
decentralized infrastructure group but

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,200
all the rest a meeting of these two of

59
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:16,169
them the computation in the network

60
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,510
group and the quantum Internet's group

61
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:22,419
proposed research groups new groups get

62
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,399
a year to act as acts as if they are a

63
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:25,989
research group and then we they go for a

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,290
review and we we decide if they should

65
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,760
be made permanent for research groups

66
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,340
the the competition in the network group

67
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,280
will be having that that that review

68
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,739
this week the quantum internet group

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,500
will be doing that at the next meeting

70
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,180
all the rest for full research groups

71
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,400
and the majority of them have still to

72
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,379
meet so look out for them on the agenda

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,379
and please do consider participating

74
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,550
in addition to the research groups we

75
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:00,020
run to other activities in the IRT F

76
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,790
those of you who were at the meeting in

77
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,260
Montreal earlier in the year would have

78
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,959
seen the applied networking research

79
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:09,709
workshop for 2019 running in parallel

80
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,620
with the meeting in Montreal I'm pleased

81
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:14,620
to announce that the 2020 applied

82
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,510
networking research workshop will

83
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,060
collocate with the ITF in Madrid next

84
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,240
summer that workshop will be chaired by

85
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,070
Maria and Roland who many of you will

86
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,260
know look out for the call for papers

87
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,880
for that in the next couple of weeks I

88
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,050
expect with paper submission deadlines

89
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,020
will be in the sort of March April

90
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,970
timeframe and the proceedings will be

91
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,580
published in the ACM digital library

92
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:43,970
this is all done in conjunction with ACM

93
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:46,719
sitcom the other activity we we have is

94
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,820
the applied networking research price

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,590
this is a price awarded for recent

96
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,110
results in a play networking research

97
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,239
which may be relevant to transitioning

98
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:01,100
into internet products related standards

99
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,300
and the IRT F and the IETF we've got one

100
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,160
a NRP

101
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,690
prize-winning talk which will be

102
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,630
happening just just after I finish these

103
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:13,280
introductory remarks by weighting Chang

104
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:15,560
who'd be talking about TCP exploits and

105
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,309
how wireless wireless routers can

106
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,620
jeopardize your secrets we also have the

107
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,110
nominations for the 20/20 applied

108
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,590
networking research prizes which are now

109
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:31,669
open if you go to the ITF tog /a NRP

110
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,799
website if you've read any good papers

111
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,240
on a played networking research anything

112
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,970
which you think would be deserving of a

113
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,210
prize to bring the off bring the offer

114
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:44,720
to the IRT F and the ITF for a week then

115
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,370
please consider nominating that work the

116
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,820
deadline for nominations is at the end

117
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:55,340
of this week good good good nominations

118
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,820
good work to potentially award the price

119
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,700
- we typically award - prices for each

120
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,599
of the IETF meetings so we're looking

121
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,080
for six good papers to

122
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,720
the awards too we had hoped to have to

123
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,219
to price price winning talks today the

124
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,090
the ever speaker the ever awardee had

125
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,830
family issues which meant that she

126
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,270
couldn't attend this meeting so we'll be

127
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,620
postponing that talk and won't be doing

128
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,620
it at one of the later meetings instead

129
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,800
so that's about all I have to say the

130
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,090
agenda for today the first thing we have

131
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:37,220
up is waiting with his AARP

132
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:39,780
prize-winning talk TCP exploits

133
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,490
following that we've got a brief update

134
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,219
on the computation in the network

135
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:47,460
research group which as I say is

136
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,140
finishing its third meeting and will be

137
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,729
up for transitioning from proposed

138
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,789
research group to full research group

139
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:57,060
after this this week and then we've got

140
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,370
some discussion we've got a little bit

141
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,020
of discussion from Melinda will be

142
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,760
leading talking about the relation

143
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:07,469
between the IRT F and the IETF Erin and

144
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,360
Lawrence will be leading some discussion

145
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,000
about moving work from the research

146
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,740
world into the standards world I'll be

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,500
finishing up with some discussion about

148
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,530
how the IETF can help so we have the IRT

149
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,210
F sorry excuse the Tokyo there can help

150
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,210
academia and vice-versa

151
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:32,120
so with that I guess we should move on

152
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,120
to the prize-winning talk waiting

153
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,740
okay um good afternoon thanks for the

154
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,100
introduction and thank you for coming

155
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:24,930
for my talk okay sure

156
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:27,750
is that better so today I'm going to

157
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,520
share a new side channel we discovered

158
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,890
in all generations our various

159
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,780
technology and how we can export it to

160
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,840
perform of past history injection

161
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,179
attacks this is basically a cross layer

162
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,160
attack in which a design choice our

163
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:46,170
various protocol can actually compromise

164
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:49,770
the security and application layer so

165
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,260
what's the what what is the past history

166
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:56,130
injection attack here's the threat model

167
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:58,319
we used in our work for now I added

168
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,560
Ultra is not involved in this drug model

169
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,520
but I will get to that later typically

170
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,609
given to host one client and one target

171
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,710
server Mallory is able to inject spoofed

172
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,940
data into the wicket in connection

173
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:16,650
between the client and the server

174
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,070
the attack is performed in the following

175
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:22,199
steps first Malory convicting into

176
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,650
visiting the malicious website for

177
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,140
example via phishing email and then when

178
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,060
the victim clicks on the link given in

179
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,900
the phishing email and with it the

180
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,719
malicious website a transcript well

181
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,150
wrong on the kind machine which can

182
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,250
initiate two connections went to the

183
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:45,000
target server and the other one to the

184
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:47,220
of hasn't occurred since these two

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,410
connections are on our control we can

186
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:54,150
send arbitrary numbers of requests to

187
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:56,699
the target server so that the connection

188
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,220
between the client and the server can be

189
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,880
kept alive for a long time as long as we

190
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,050
keep sending requests to the server as

191
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,420
opposed to man in the middle attacks

192
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,240
where the attacker can intercept the

193
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,729
response and temper the content Mallory

194
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,720
is completely off pass and can no is job

195
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,800
any of these traffic mallory however

196
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,050
consent

197
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,990
spoofed packets with server's IP address

198
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,339
to pretend to be the server of course

199
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,440
the client will validate

200
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:30,060
every incoming packet based on some

201
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,730
secret share between and the server the

202
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:39,209
secret is created when the connection is

203
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:41,250
established because of the secret is

204
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,980
really difficult for the attacker for

205
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,520
the office attacker to sense both

206
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,070
packets with the correct secret if we

207
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,439
just do random guess

208
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:54,780
therefore the transcript roni on the

209
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,330
kind of machine is also for the purpose

210
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,280
of sending some feedback informing the

211
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,850
attacker whether his guessing is correct

212
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,610
or not

213
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,290
since the just crib has no privilege it

214
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,180
can not appear into the victim

215
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,480
connection and the steal the secret

216
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,579
instead we rely on such a node to infer

217
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,510
to behave yourself how the client

218
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,610
response to those spoofed packets and

219
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,890
then based on the feedbacks the attacker

220
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:23,130
can guess multiple rooms and finally

221
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:25,920
figure out what's the correct secret you

222
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:28,500
may wonder was the impact of this red

223
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,479
model because even though we can inject

224
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,790
spoof data into the richting connection

225
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,520
the whole procedure is performed on the

226
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,579
malicious website and the attacker can

227
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:42,930
already control the whole page why would

228
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:46,920
we bother to do this well the trick here

229
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:49,380
is that once the spoof data is accepted

230
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,170
by the client it will be cached in the

231
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,180
browser for long time so you can imagine

232
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,550
that next time when the user when the

233
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,270
richting tries to access the same server

234
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:02,400
the browser will actually reload this

235
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:05,730
injection page rather than sending a new

236
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,010
request to the server and even worse if

237
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:11,160
the user does not clear the cache

238
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:16,170
manually it can be cached in your

239
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:18,480
browser for years here supposed to be a

240
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,329
video demo but unfortunately we can not

241
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,180
do that so I just took some snapshots to

242
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,670
give your sound flavor of how it looks

243
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:30,030
like as I mentioned earlier when the

244
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,849
weak thing tries to access the malicious

245
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:34,350
website there are actually two

246
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,510
connections underneath one connects to

247
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,080
the Tagus server in this case it's dosia

248
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,410
news web

249
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:44,270
site and the other one connects to D of

250
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:47,939
past attacker launching the real attack

251
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:50,400
once the are once the attacks exceed the

252
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,440
injected page will be cached in the

253
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,260
browser and when the user tries to

254
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,150
access the home page of the news he or

255
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,910
she will actually see this page showing

256
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:03,120
up as we can see there is an injected

257
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:06,480
login component at the top this is only

258
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,390
this is a one version of the attack we

259
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,270
performed for Windows there is actually

260
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:14,040
another version for Mac OS you can find

261
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:18,990
these two videos through the link given

262
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:21,990
in our paper so what's the secret I'm

263
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:24,420
talking about in order to successfully

264
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,820
inject spoof daytime to the recuiting

265
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,209
connection we need to know how to speech

266
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:36,120
tag validates an incoming packet here's

267
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:38,010
the simplified TCP specification the

268
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,130
secret I'm talking about it's actually

269
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:44,069
Street Apple including put numbers

270
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:47,730
sequence number and old acknowledgement

271
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:51,420
number so let's take a close look at a

272
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,910
sequence number check as we can see here

273
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,490
when the peghead contempts then out of

274
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,980
windows sequence number the client will

275
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:02,610
actually send a reasonable eye response

276
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,290
back to the server in the other case

277
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,540
where the sequence number is in bingo

278
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,819
but the acknowledgement number is out

279
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:12,569
homing though the packet will be Santa

280
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,970
chopped so we can see here there is the

281
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,860
client will actually behave differently

282
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:22,260
depending on whether the sequence number

283
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:24,450
is England or not right I actually have

284
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,280
a question about this and I got this

285
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,460
question a lot but I don't have a

286
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,520
perfect answer for this so basically the

287
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,890
question is that why the client should

288
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,260
send a response back to the package

289
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,439
even if the package contains an auto

290
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:44,700
Windows sequence number does anyone in

291
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,920
this room know the answer or any

292
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,680
reasoning for this because it sounds

293
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,599
weird if you know that the packet is

294
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,790
broken

295
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,460
in terms of regarding the sequence

296
00:14:52,790 --> 00:15:01,670
number why we should send a response

297
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:06,350
back right yeah that's a question we can

298
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:09,199
discuss later let's move on so there

299
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,330
actually are several tongue side

300
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,700
channels against the TCP connections I

301
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:17,720
am NOT going to dig into the details but

302
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:20,210
I won't I just want to summarize there

303
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,520
first to say that such channels have

304
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,800
been fixed already

305
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,380
the third one requires a malware running

306
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,560
on the kind of machine to monitor the

307
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,990
system in our work we discovered a new

308
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,170
side channel that is inherent in all

309
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:39,980
generations of various technology and

310
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:42,740
the alphas attack we we present in our

311
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,930
work only requires a transcript running

312
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,750
on the can machine and all three major

313
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:50,569
operating systems are affected by the

314
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:53,300
attack it's also worth noting that our

315
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,880
tech is the only working one without any

316
00:15:53,300 --> 00:16:00,650
mitigation in place and it's practically

317
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,900
infeasible to fix it so from a hell of a

318
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,689
view of the side channel attacks against

319
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,270
TCP connection that are discovered in

320
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:10,160
prior work or often manifests themselves

321
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,560
through the following control flow bulk

322
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,400
there are actually two essential

323
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,439
building blocks first anytime you have a

324
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,810
side channel there must be some global

325
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,530
resource shared between the attacker and

326
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:26,449
victim in the context of TCP side

327
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,449
channels depending on whether the

328
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:32,590
sequence number is in window or not the

329
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:35,540
shared state may change accordingly

330
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,730
secondly and most importantly the shared

331
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:42,800
state change must be observable to the

332
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:44,800
attacker so what's the shared resource

333
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:51,050
we discovering a router

334
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:54,020
well the insight is that the half duplex

335
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,089
nature of Wireless creates a shared

336
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,810
resource between uplink and downlink

337
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,180
traffic

338
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,489
half duplex is in contrast to folk

339
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,670
duplex photo blocks means that both

340
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,939
opening and darling

341
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,849
traffic can transmit at the same time

342
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:11,669
well for a half-duplex only allows one

343
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,530
direction to transmit at a time for

344
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:17,970
wireless networks it makes perfect sense

345
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:20,010
to use half duplex because if both ends

346
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,919
try to just mate at the same frequency

347
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,619
and at the same time it's likely to

348
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,710
cause interference back half and then

349
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,989
retransmission since half duplex is a

350
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:34,940
fundamental design choice of well this

351
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,799
protocol is really difficult to change

352
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:43,590
let's considered following two scenarios

353
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:46,168
in wellies let's consider assume that

354
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,510
the client has established two

355
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:50,970
connections went to the Tagus server and

356
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,640
the DIA went to the opposite hacker in

357
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:56,549
this case the opposite hacker can send

358
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:01,290
both legitimate and spoofed packets to

359
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:04,230
the client because because we're lease

360
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,240
is half duplex when both uplink and

361
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,130
downlink traffic are transmitting at the

362
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,950
same time it's likely to cause

363
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,690
interference which enforces either or

364
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,419
both ends to back off and then

365
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,850
retransmit suppose the client gets the

366
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:22,740
chance to transmit then the spoofed

367
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:26,250
packet has to wait to be sent later so

368
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,650
does the third packet as we can see here

369
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,320
the wrong shape term of the post probe

370
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:36,390
car now is prolonged due to this

371
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:38,909
particular spoofed packet let's consider

372
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:41,340
a similar scenario compared to their

373
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,919
previous one is almost the same except

374
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,860
that now the spoofed packet can trigger

375
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,750
a response recall that when the packet

376
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,939
contains an outer window sequence number

377
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:55,650
the current should send a resource back

378
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:59,429
right but the issue here is that the

379
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,980
packet is sent back to the server so how

380
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:06,720
did how does the attacker can see this

381
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:09,000
can see the difference well because of

382
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,150
this additional response triggered by

383
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,549
the spoof to package the third the

384
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,300
packet now the post pop carry now

385
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:19,690
experience more contention

386
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,360
increasing is ron shipp time let's put

387
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,940
on together as we can see there is a

388
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,520
timing difference of the round shaped

389
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:34,380
hands for the post pub hurry in these

390
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:37,750
two scenarios therefore based on the

391
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,480
ground ship thomas the attacker can

392
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:43,059
determine whether the spoofed packet has

393
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,130
triggered a response or not which in

394
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,530
turn tells whether the scible packet

395
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:55,540
contains a correct sequence number or

396
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:57,550
not however you may wonder that does the

397
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:01,059
timing difference resulted from these

398
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:05,770
additional response is too small to be

399
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:10,480
measurable well that's true but what if

400
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:13,690
we can amplify the signal so in this

401
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,780
figure we also illustrate the amplified

402
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:20,080
nature of the side channel in this case

403
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:22,809
the attacker can stand two probing spoof

404
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,480
two packets to the client causing more

405
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:28,420
contention which delays the third post

406
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,900
pop carry you have even further which

407
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:34,120
means the mole probing packets we sent

408
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,970
the more contention we experienced and

409
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:40,649
therefore we can observe larger round

410
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:43,840
shaped hands I also want to mention that

411
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:46,120
this is not exactly what happens in

412
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,459
reality because reality is more complex

413
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,219
than this but I hope it can offers a

414
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:57,120
concrete example to show the timing

415
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:59,470
difference so far we only discuss

416
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,110
conceptually discussed timing such

417
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,600
channel and its effect now I want to

418
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:08,199
show some empirical test results to

419
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,320
understand the real world implication we

420
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,660
created a total of 16 different setups

421
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,870
to make sure that the timing difference

422
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:19,480
the time inside China exists in various

423
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:22,479
products we used four different routers

424
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,690
noters and two different versions of as

425
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,800
the client we also varied the frequency

426
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,800
of each daughter's

427
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:35,039
so follow the same probing strategy I

428
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:37,710
mentioned earlier we measure the round

429
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,919
shape times of the post pop carry with

430
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:44,520
100 runs we pick 3 representative test

431
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:47,460
results here as we can see the timing

432
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,879
difference is clear and measurable on

433
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,980
average is about 2 milliseconds and also

434
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,289
the timing difference grows as we

435
00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:00,029
increment the number of popping packets

436
00:21:55,289 --> 00:22:01,860
we send per test we also measure the

437
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:04,860
round-trip times at two different

438
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,928
locations where where the attacker is

439
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,189
far away from the richting with

440
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:12,809
round-trip times over 20 milliseconds

441
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,270
although there is more overlapping

442
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:17,520
between those boxes the timing

443
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:24,149
difference is still clearly present and

444
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:27,168
measurable so back to the TCP of has no

445
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:31,229
check where we want to infer the secrets

446
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:34,980
secret let's start with the pod number

447
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:36,899
inference since the client will behave

448
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,850
differently depending on whether the

449
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:40,110
sequence number whether the poll number

450
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,178
is correct or not

451
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,418
the attacker can actually send multiple

452
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:47,610
spoof probing packets with a guest saw

453
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,260
spot number to the client and then

454
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,979
determine whether his guessing is

455
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,890
correct or not

456
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:58,169
by simply exploiting the timing side

457
00:22:52,890 --> 00:23:00,500
Channel now that we know the PO number

458
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:03,419
we can further infer the sequence number

459
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,250
compared to this PO number inference is

460
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,919
a monster sim we can still apply the

461
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:10,529
guess then checks King chewing for the

462
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,570
sequence number however the issue here

463
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:14,640
is that it's unclear whether all the

464
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:19,980
operating systems will behave the same

465
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:23,970
as we illustrated here so we await the

466
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,980
late latest Linux and Mac OS by

467
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:28,620
inspecting their kernel source code and

468
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,860
develop it it has a program to measure

469
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,539
the behaviors of Windows this table

470
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,149
shows the behaviors of different

471
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:39,809
operating systems when processing 10

472
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:41,979
identical packets as we can see here the

473
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:44,710
3 operating system behaves

474
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,630
instantly on sequence number check which

475
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,179
means that we can always apply the gas

476
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:52,890
in checks King to infer the sequence

477
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:58,630
number there's one interesting fact of

478
00:23:52,890 --> 00:24:02,890
about the behaviors of windows in it I

479
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,600
didn't show the show the numbers in this

480
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:08,559
table you can find the complete table

481
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:11,320
you know in our paper so the the fact is

482
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,780
that we found that when the so normally

483
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,450
in the opposite draft we it says that

484
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,220
the client should send a response back

485
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:23,559
when the package contains an outer

486
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,980
windows link wisdom / right but we I'm

487
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:28,360
sorry

488
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:31,720
so in the RC Draft except that we should

489
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,928
accept any sequence number in the window

490
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,270
right but we found that in Windows if

491
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:40,450
the connection is idle then it only

492
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:43,150
accept sequence number that exactly

493
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:48,160
equal to the next expected sequence

494
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,700
number and this behavior is never I

495
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,630
guess

496
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:55,690
never specified in any RFC Stander's so

497
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:59,200
I don't know why windows have

498
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:02,169
implemented in this way so if anyone

499
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,100
from Microsoft knowing the answer for

500
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:09,280
this and we appreciate answer okay let's

501
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:11,799
continue the implementation for

502
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,020
acknowledgement number check actually

503
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:17,350
varies significantly from one device to

504
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:19,750
another so we propose customized

505
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,299
strategies for each operating system by

506
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:26,860
exploiting the HTTP specification and

507
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:30,280
the behaviors of browsers remember that

508
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:32,290
our ultimate goal is to perform of

509
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,299
plasticity injection attacks we don't

510
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:37,629
actually need to know the exact egg

511
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:39,790
number to perform the attack therefore

512
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:44,880
we can just brute force every possible

513
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:47,320
act number and even though we can still

514
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,030
exploit the time inside channel to infer

515
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,520
the egg number the brute forcing

516
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:54,170
strategy is more efficient only taking a

517
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:59,120
couple seconds as there is no

518
00:25:54,170 --> 00:26:01,730
oh no waiting for check so we

519
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,340
implemented a complete attack for each

520
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:06,440
operating system that has results as

521
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,189
shown in the up table regarding the

522
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,230
success rate and average tank host we

523
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,990
also to further demonstrate that this

524
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,240
attack is practical we also report the

525
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,700
result under a remote attacker scenario

526
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,620
where the attacker is far away from the

527
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:27,110
richting with round-trip times over 20

528
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:29,929
milliseconds so how serious is the Tammy

529
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:34,300
side Channel after we discovered this

530
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:37,340
issue we reached out to discuss this

531
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:40,639
vulnerability with HFO yield to the 11

532
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:43,250
working group but unfortunately we all

533
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,300
agreed that this is almost impossible to

534
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:49,820
be fixed at physical and Mac layers that

535
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:54,139
being said we still need to discuss some

536
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:56,300
possible defenses and mitigations one

537
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:59,480
straightforward idea is to make various

538
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:02,629
photo Plex although research has been

539
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,760
done on this area we are still facing

540
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,130
some real-world challenges which need to

541
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,470
be carefully adjust and it's unclear

542
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:14,150
when the technology will be readily

543
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:17,480
deployed in practice since our check

544
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:20,660
also exploited TCP specification making

545
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,400
TCP stack behave consistently regardless

546
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,160
of the sequence and acknowledgement

547
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,760
number would be a good defense when

548
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,530
possible strategy to consider is to

549
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,110
really meet responses for incoming

550
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:35,210
packets with out of windows sequence

551
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,580
number so that the attacker can no

552
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:41,770
longer amplify the signal by simply

553
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,770
sending multiple spoofed probing packets

554
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:51,260
lastly in application they're deployed

555
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:53,150
using HTTPS instead of HTTP can prevent

556
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,280
your check even though it does not

557
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:58,190
eliminate the root cause of the set

558
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,010
channel and I also want to emphasize

559
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:03,610
that deploying HTTPS is not enough if

560
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:06,810
HTTP strict Transport Security

561
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:09,939
security is absent

562
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:12,310
well representative example is does the

563
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:16,180
a news website I showed earlier in the

564
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:18,970
demo you can see that CN news website

565
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:22,150
does use HTTPS but we can still make the

566
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,790
attack succeed right the theme here is

567
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:28,180
that when the user tries to access the

568
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:31,750
homepage of CN news website the initial

569
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:34,480
request was submitted over HTTP and then

570
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:38,080
if the server that subsequently redirect

571
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,920
the browser to its HTTP set therefore

572
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,970
the attacker can simply inject a spoofed

573
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:49,300
page inject a fake page for the initial

574
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:55,420
request so my point here is that even

575
00:28:49,300 --> 00:29:00,010
though you have deployed HTTPS if you do

576
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:02,680
not enforce it then it's useless to

577
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:04,720
conclude we found a new timing site

578
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,450
channel that is inherent in all

579
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,010
generations of various technology and we

580
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,410
show that the time aside China is

581
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:13,450
reliable and amplify herbal and it's

582
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,220
almost impossible to fix it without

583
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:18,520
substantial change to the wireless

584
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:21,160
specification we also showed that the

585
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:24,250
time inside China affects Windows Mac OS

586
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,990
and Linux by studying their TCP stack

587
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,430
implementation and conducting your own

588
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,830
world attacks against them

589
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:32,410
we also stressed some possible

590
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,629
differences to alleviate this issue the

591
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,150
source code of the attack is publicly

592
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:41,260
available online so if you're interested

593
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:43,450
you should check it out that's all for

594
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,690
my presentation sex for your attention

595
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:49,230
I'm happy to take any questions thank

596
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,230
you very much

597
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:58,530
so it's Daniel con Gilmore from the ACLU

598
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:00,659
thank you for this work this is really

599
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,060
great stuff and it's a good reminder to

600
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:06,600
all of us that timing side channels can

601
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:08,970
be stepping stones towards towards other

602
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,649
problems so I really appreciate the way

603
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,570
that you've connected all the dots here

604
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:15,270
and showing that this can be done I was

605
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,620
curious about your proposed mitigations

606
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,480
whether you've had a chance to test any

607
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:22,110
of them in the same environments that

608
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,880
you tested the exploit itself so in

609
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,669
particular I'm thinking about the

610
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,720
mitigations that can be done at the TCP

611
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:32,460
layer itself right the the middle

612
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,360
mitigation that you described there if

613
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,490
you had a chance to test like modifying

614
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,379
the kernel or something like that to see

615
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,270
whether it would affect the results that

616
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,580
you that you got for the other attack

617
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:49,230
yeah that's a good question actually we

618
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,270
so if you look at the source code for

619
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:54,180
linux kernel it actually have

620
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:56,460
implemented some mechanism that is to

621
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:59,040
really make responses for incoming

622
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:02,880
packets but we found that it's actually

623
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:06,570
only really made for for the income tax

624
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,490
that has no payload so I'm not sure why

625
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:11,550
they doing this but so you can see that

626
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:14,040
you can actually bypass this check you

627
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:17,490
just need to add one bad payload to the

628
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:21,930
packet and then it can it doesn't check

629
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:24,830
the limit for the responses so that's

630
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,830
another questions I also want to ask why

631
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:30,360
Linux kernel increments things like this

632
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:33,570
yeah there are a lot of discrepancy

633
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:37,110
about all the implementation of Windows

634
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:39,480
Mac OS and they seems to have their own

635
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:46,320
implementation rather than stick to the

636
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:50,970
standards yeah Allison mankin Salesforce

637
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,889
I I really like this and I also like the

638
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:55,140
questions you were asking about why TCP

639
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:56,820
is the way it is yeah it's a very old

640
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,030
protocol but I think those would be very

641
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,620
good discussions to have in a TCP

642
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:06,250
working group as well as the minute

643
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:08,290
you've talked about and and also check

644
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:11,170
on whether the new transport protocols

645
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,940
are you know making some of the I think

646
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:16,320
there might be less mistake being made

647
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:19,270
now but I had a quick question about

648
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:22,659
your evaluation where you talked about

649
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,610
the average time cost was slide 30 if I

650
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,910
was wondering what that meant what does

651
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:30,250
average time cost mean is that for ten

652
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:33,070
successes to get through at that amount

653
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:36,340
of time yeah we launched the attack ten

654
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:38,950
times and then we calculate average time

655
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:42,659
for Oded Houghton's

656
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:45,880
attack okay because I wonder if if

657
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:48,010
connections are typically short which

658
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,280
many of them are too short is it much

659
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:56,320
harder to make this attack yeah that's

660
00:32:50,280 --> 00:33:01,480
actually is feasible if you I'm sorry so

661
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,189
I talked about this earlier so these two

662
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,350
connections are created by the

663
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,929
transcript which is on the over control

664
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,240
right so we can send up three numbers of

665
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:11,710
requests to the server so that the

666
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,320
connection between the client and the

667
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:16,360
server will be kept alive for long time

668
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:21,120
as long as you keep sending requests

669
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,120
then the the connection will be alive

670
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:36,300
thank you what extent is this specific

671
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:47,399
issues as I mentioned earlier this is a

672
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:52,090
fundamental design choice of various

673
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:54,460
protocols so it's and and it it of

674
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:56,530
course makes perfect sense to use half

675
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,050
duplex is there's nothing wrong with

676
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,678
half duplex interval this has to deal

677
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:05,590
with it

678
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:08,320
so so that so we so we discussed this

679
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:12,460
issue with our table you know to the

680
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,470
working group and yeah they although

681
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:20,720
they acknowledge this ball

682
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:22,699
bility but we can do nothing toyatte do

683
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:27,368
you know if our wireless protocols have

684
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:27,368
similar behavior did you look in silence

685
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:36,889
alright sorry chrissteele just to extend

686
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,449
that point even though you don't know

687
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:40,010
about it presumably would apply to any

688
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:44,960
system that where the last link is half

689
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:47,780
duplex could you repeal it presumably

690
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,240
uh-huh the same attack would apply to

691
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:55,119
any system where the last link is half

692
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:58,279
duplex yeah even if it's not Wi-Fi yeah

693
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:05,560
conceptually it is but I didn't find

694
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,560
anything using half duplex thank you

695
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:28,400
that's a typical mitigation but yours

696
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:32,089
you need to think about the implication

697
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,119
because the delay can cause I guess if

698
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:37,880
you want if it will slow down the hoc

699
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:42,290
network then it will be a another

700
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:44,150
problem right so I'm not sure yeah of

701
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:46,970
course that you can delay you can add

702
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:50,839
more randomization here there but I'm

703
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:54,160
not sure how we can implement it without

704
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:54,160
minimal cost

705
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,170
okay are there any more questions

706
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:24,470
okay well let's thank the speaker again

707
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:26,980
thank you all right thank you next up is

708
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,980
Marie Jose

709
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:46,430
so so well Marissa is coming up just a

710
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:49,100
reminder that just a reminder that

711
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:51,109
nominations for the Ani PA are open

712
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,850
until the end of the week so if you've

713
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,710
read any good applied networking

714
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,799
research papers please go to the website

715
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,980
and nominate them for the price for next

716
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,980
year

717
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,890
good afternoon everyone I'm Murray I'm

718
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,790
presenting in the name of our tree

719
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:16,810
co-chairs Jeffery even I

720
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:19,970
andwe're coin computing in a network and

721
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:21,350
before I start for the IAB people who

722
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,600
heard us this morning this is going to

723
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:25,430
be old stuff but at the same time I

724
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,080
would like to thank you for your

725
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,850
comments this morning and to have

726
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:34,040
actually highlighted new things that we

727
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:36,259
should do in our group it's not good

728
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,110
enough again

729
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,000
oh my god okay so again thanks ABB for

730
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:44,150
hosting us and for the comments by the

731
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,590
way who are we where do people who want

732
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,650
to put computing in the network or

733
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:50,990
network and the computers essentially

734
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,060
looking at the melding of computing

735
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,040
networking and storage as things go

736
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:59,299
forward and so we want to foster

737
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,310
research in computing in the network we

738
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,380
want to improve the performance for the

739
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:05,870
network's themselves and for the

740
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,910
application especially the emerging

741
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:10,609
applications in machine learning in

742
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:14,569
industrial networks and in autonomous

743
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:16,010
systems where our focus is architectures

744
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,440
I'm actually an architect so I'm

745
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:19,700
interested in that protocols we have a

746
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,730
lot of people in our group who like

747
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:25,790
developing protocols and also because we

748
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:27,710
also have the link to industrial R&D in

749
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:31,640
the group a lot of people are looking at

750
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:33,140
real world use cases applications and a

751
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,150
lot of work in progress we are a

752
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,790
research group we are not producing

753
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:40,040
products we're not even looking at doing

754
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:42,170
products but we're looking at new ways

755
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,660
of using products new ways of doing

756
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:47,090
research with them and even fundamental

757
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,730
ways of changing maybe the way that we

758
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:52,700
look at how when we move information

759
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,210
from place to another what can we do to

760
00:38:52,700 --> 00:39:00,470
that info

761
00:38:53,210 --> 00:39:03,680
to make the whole thing work better so

762
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:05,779
how did we get there there was some

763
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,240
active networking in the 90s which was

764
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,890
more or less successful but got people

765
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,049
thinking that when packets go through

766
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,089
the network maybe there's some functions

767
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:17,240
that can actually carry that go with

768
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:19,820
them there was work I would say in the

769
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,890
past maybe five years in data centers

770
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,650
and especially orchestration of data

771
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:27,319
center elements with the famous paxos

772
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:30,260
protocol and I have to keep this an

773
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:33,170
impression it's hitting me there was a

774
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:36,170
development by barefoot networks amongst

775
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:38,060
others of the Tofino switches and who

776
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,850
are programmable with the p4 language

777
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,590
barefoot was purchased by Intel which

778
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,970
gave you know the whole thing a new way

779
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,910
maybe of looking at this computer

780
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:51,439
architecture edge computing for a lot of

781
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:53,690
us was or made mainly art or careers had

782
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,880
a lot of heritage from what people did

783
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:58,460
in information centric networking name

784
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,530
function networking distributed network

785
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,670
there's actually another group a

786
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,030
research group and distributed

787
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:08,350
networking that we plan really to

788
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:12,260
collaborate with a lot of our

789
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:13,610
collaborators are working and worked on

790
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:16,400
something that's called compute first

791
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:18,500
networking which actually had two very

792
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,680
successful workshop even before that we

793
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:24,410
were even thought about as a potential

794
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,930
research group I talked about the

795
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:29,569
embedded

796
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:31,310
AI and ml and also if you think about it

797
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:34,160
up to now a lot of people were thinking

798
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:35,720
of applications there were edge

799
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,730
applications they were cloud

800
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,529
applications maybe more and more just

801
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:43,000
cloud and there's a lot of applications

802
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:47,230
that are poorly served if you only do

803
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,640
cloud in terms of delays in terms of

804
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,070
intermittent connectivity and a lot of

805
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:58,430
things that maybe you want to do in

806
00:40:52,070 --> 00:41:03,710
between the two edges so our history we

807
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:06,589
first met in in Montreal close now 18

808
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:08,390
months ago it's not infocom it's a calm

809
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,310
we had a lot of meetings there we met

810
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:13,569
people at USENIX this year we met in

811
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:16,910
Bangkok we met in Prague we met in

812
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:20,750
Montreal during the summer we're meeting

813
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:22,990
here we had two web-based interims and

814
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:25,970
we had to occur tones on p4 and data

815
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:27,950
filtering in Montreal and actually over

816
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:31,189
that weekend we're meeting this week on

817
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:33,399
Friday so please come we're very lucky

818
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:36,350
that we have a bunch of collaborators

819
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,390
around the world I was proud this week

820
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:41,029
that we had also people from Singapore

821
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:43,790
who collaborated to the hackathon and

822
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:46,130
people from South America so I think it

823
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:48,440
was great that we were basically having

824
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:51,050
people from everywhere and so we have a

825
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,300
really good mix of computer scientists

826
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,580
application developers implementers and

827
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,650
people in industry so it creates really

828
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:01,340
a great way of discussing about where

829
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:05,150
this is going so our this is a work

830
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,530
matrix this ID that there's the cloud

831
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:09,050
there's the address everything in

832
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:13,060
between and how can we distribute the

833
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:15,740
computation inside the network to

834
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,990
essentially make things better and make

835
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,399
things better it's not a single thing

836
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:21,080
and it's not a single set of

837
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,110
requirements and it's not a single set

838
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,509
of performance indicators it actually

839
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:30,290
depends on what the application and what

840
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:33,410
the service needs I don't have a lot of

841
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:35,810
time so I'm gonna go fast over this but

842
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,410
this is all part of the discussions that

843
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:41,290
we've been having for the past year

844
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:45,319
where do we want to put these things

845
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:47,390
obviously not all boxes will perform

846
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,130
network related functions there was

847
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,330
actually a comment this morning about

848
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,540
the fact that there's encrypted

849
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:57,410
transports and some of these things will

850
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:59,990
not be compatible what does it mean to

851
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:03,440
do packet processing to which level do

852
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:05,990
we want to act on the packets do we just

853
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,270
want to filter them so we can do

854
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,890
something once the information the

855
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:11,630
filter with the residual error which

856
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,759
actually or the residual packets which

857
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:19,130
would be something that is very much

858
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,450
related to AI maybe we just don't want

859
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,880
just to do compute

860
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:24,439
but also storage I said if we do packet

861
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,060
filtering we may want to store these

862
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,850
things where do we want to store these

863
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,799
things how do we deal with discovering

864
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,509
where they could be stored how do we

865
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,540
deal with the security of that data the

866
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:37,190
privacy so it's all part of that

867
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:40,160
obviously if I'm a developer I don't

868
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:42,350
want to specify where my computing is

869
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,470
but I may want to know how there's a

870
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:49,279
discovery mechanism to allow me to find

871
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:51,919
where this computing and this caching if

872
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:57,050
necessary will be done in the best way

873
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:59,120
and obviously more and more in big data

874
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:01,340
applications there's an awful lot of

875
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,370
data at the edge and we may want to do

876
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,710
some computing to reduce this

877
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:09,620
information and manage this data

878
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,780
implosion I come from Canada in the

879
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,970
northern regions of Canada there is not

880
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,620
there is no broadband and even if we

881
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,330
want to have some big data applications

882
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,339
there for monitoring the environment for

883
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,470
example at one point we need to use a

884
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:25,360
satellite to go up and we may want to do

885
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,359
some local processing before we do that

886
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:33,799
our objective is systematically look at

887
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:35,270
these different instantiations we had

888
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,160
comments from the beginning and people

889
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:40,430
who are here will recognize themselves

890
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,859
we're saying well are there any common

891
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:44,660
principles or their common abstractions

892
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:47,800
or their ways that we could do that in

893
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:51,140
common or this will be completely a

894
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,780
dislocated type of set of things that

895
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:58,040
really don't work together I think we

896
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:59,780
find this may not be completely true but

897
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,390
there are common things we're thinking

898
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:05,600
of common data layers right now and at

899
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:07,029
least common computing architectures we

900
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:11,210
want to know what are the best practices

901
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:13,610
we want again to look at if there are

902
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:16,610
non forwarding functions obviously not

903
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:19,550
all nodes or forwarding and not nodes

904
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:21,470
all nodes will be computing and actually

905
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:24,620
what are the incentives to add this

906
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:26,689
stuff in the network so that new

907
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:29,140
services and implementers know that it

908
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,140
exists

909
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:35,910
so what's the commonality I said we

910
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:38,669
looked at it so we want to select a

911
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:40,770
programming paradigm we want to marshal

912
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,779
the resources obviously we'll need to

913
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,880
meet requirements constraint and

914
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:47,039
policies have been working a lot in IOT

915
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,970
and sensor networks recently and there's

916
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,890
a lot of constraints there we want to be

917
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:55,470
adapt to changing condition leverage

918
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:57,900
telemetry and again this was very much

919
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,669
highlighted this morning these ideas of

920
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,710
the security the privacy and the trust

921
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:05,099
guarantees we have to be able to trust

922
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:07,470
the elements that do the computing we've

923
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:10,829
been very lucky we've been there for one

924
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:14,848
year and we have tons of people who

925
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:16,410
contributed rafts to the group and it

926
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:17,760
covers if you look at this accept

927
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:19,950
security which somebody again

928
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,359
highlighted this morning all these

929
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:24,149
drafts cover a lot of what we're

930
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:26,700
interested in augmented reality data

931
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,740
discovery managed networks app centers

932
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,808
industrial use cases which is also one

933
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:35,970
of my big thing requirements which is

934
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:38,039
interests and the transport issues how

935
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:40,200
are things when you look at end to end

936
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:41,789
with encryption or even end-to-end

937
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,098
principles and you want to start

938
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:45,690
thinking computing element in between

939
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:49,589
how do you deal with that and that's

940
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:51,329
actually a big question that we have so

941
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:54,779
this is I would like you to join us a

942
00:46:51,329 --> 00:46:56,279
Friday and I think we're all very

943
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:57,839
passionate about this we think there's

944
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:59,250
really cool stuff that we can do and we

945
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:03,990
hope you can join us in our sandbox

946
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:06,180
thank you very much thank you Marie does

947
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:09,259
anyone have any questions on this any

948
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,259
questions or comments

949
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:15,879
either I was great and you guys are

950
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,250
completely stunned or I was terrible in

951
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:24,370
you're all asleep thank you anyway thank

952
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:26,380
you thank you so there's some really

953
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,480
interesting work in the coin group so

954
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,610
please do consider joining them on

955
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:39,820
Friday I'm assuming you're all still

956
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:41,590
here on Friday all right so what we'd

957
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:44,320
like to do for the rest of this meeting

958
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:47,680
is spend a little bit of time thinking

959
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:50,590
about the relationship between the IRT F

960
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,740
and the IETF and discussing some of the

961
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:57,490
the ways in which the two organizations

962
00:47:53,740 --> 00:48:01,000
can interact and move work between the

963
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:03,549
two organizations and so on I think we

964
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,610
have a Melinda first about the

965
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:09,720
relationship between the two I don't

966
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:09,720
have any slides is that right

967
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:19,509
and we Trent yeah we'd like this be

968
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:29,029
interactive so if you have any opinions

969
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:30,980
please do jump up at the mic and

970
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,140
actually the more I thought about this

971
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:37,580
recently the the softer my opinions

972
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:39,620
became or squishier they became right so

973
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:44,540
no slides and I apologize for that but

974
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:47,210
only a little bit yeah so last August

975
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:50,840
there was a workshop on advanced

976
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:52,460
cryptography standardization and we had

977
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:57,590
lobby I don't know if he's here or not

978
00:48:52,460 --> 00:49:01,460
gave a talk need to stand closer okay we

979
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:05,480
have lobby gave a very good talk on work

980
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:07,430
being done in the CFR G and yeah it was

981
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,460
definitely worth listening to if you're

982
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:15,680
curious about how to how to write crypto

983
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:18,530
algorithm specifications but anyway he

984
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,839
was he was sort of he was sort of

985
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:22,460
confused about what the see if RG does

986
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,490
in relationship to standards and what

987
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:29,750
the RTF does and us understands and he's

988
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:31,490
someone who was active at it so when

989
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:34,040
thinking about it you know I think that

990
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:36,649
the way I RTF research groups are

991
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,870
increasingly functioning is blurring the

992
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:41,360
lines between the IRT F in the IETF they

993
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:43,609
the way that meetings happen and the way

994
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,940
the documents are handled are signaling

995
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:49,550
that what's going on in IRT F research

996
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:55,550
groups is actually standard related and

997
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:58,010
that it is IETF related so I took a look

998
00:49:55,550 --> 00:50:00,230
at 74 18 Thank You Spencer

999
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:01,610
that was it's a great document but it

1000
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,230
was written five years ago and it was

1001
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:05,210
raising some of the same questions in

1002
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:08,450
section two which is the the bulk of the

1003
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:10,460
document so it was like the IRT F is not

1004
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:12,740
the IETF and talked about some of these

1005
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:16,520
issues around how meetings are conducted

1006
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:21,620
how documents are progressed and and so

1007
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:23,450
on and so I think that as research

1008
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,950
groups are meeting more often with the

1009
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:27,080
IETF

1010
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:29,029
we're adopting more and more of the IETF

1011
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,819
mechanisms and some of these things do

1012
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:34,370
include things like the use of internet

1013
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:38,150
drafts as documents rather than research

1014
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:41,390
papers the use of consensus based

1015
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:42,650
decision making the notion that we want

1016
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:44,839
to agree on something rather than

1017
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:48,680
necessarily supporting a diversity of

1018
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:51,500
opinions so so yeah so basically you

1019
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:55,520
know I the question is as this

1020
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,900
increasingly happens we I you know my

1021
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,910
feeling is that we need sort of need to

1022
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,010
accept things as they happen but I also

1023
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:03,230
think that we need to be careful to

1024
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:06,260
preserve what we care about in the IR

1025
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:09,950
keya the research orientation and and

1026
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:12,430
and continue our focus on producing sort

1027
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:15,470
ideas and enlightenment rather than

1028
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:17,930
specifications and engineering this is

1029
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:21,410
showing up in research group proposed

1030
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:23,210
charters as well in particular and this

1031
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:28,279
is an area that I think could use a lot

1032
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:31,460
more focus so so that's basically it you

1033
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,260
know as Colin said this is a an

1034
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:35,870
opportunity for discussion and sharing

1035
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,630
opinions and trying to figure out how we

1036
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:41,290
want to go forward and whether or not

1037
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:44,230
there's anything that needs to change

1038
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:57,020
okay thank you

1039
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:58,850
anyone have anything good sure yeah in

1040
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:02,150
general I fully agree so we have to be

1041
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:04,430
careful not to develop a certain you

1042
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:09,650
know ossified model of doing our

1043
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:13,600
research in the if' and also when we

1044
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:15,260
talk about what makes a research group

1045
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,770
successful or what is a good

1046
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:21,020
relationship and so on

1047
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:23,240
of course it's it's nice if we can you

1048
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:26,890
know move some work to the ITF at some

1049
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,890
point on the other hand

1050
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,970
on the other hand it's also valuable

1051
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:36,578
output if we you know are able to

1052
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:38,709
invalidate certain assumptions and for

1053
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:40,150
example able to say okay this actually

1054
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:43,960
doesn't make sense for the internet and

1055
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:49,960
maybe we export it but enough is enough

1056
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:51,609
and let's move on yes so fully agree we

1057
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,280
don't have to produce something which

1058
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:55,529
can go further we could you know we can

1059
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,810
explore something and they say yeah

1060
00:52:55,530 --> 00:53:03,130
we've done it

1061
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:06,700
hi Brian Trammell I was looking at the

1062
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:08,140
list of for the big all of the research

1063
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,879
groups we have known and it's cool that

1064
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,650
we're almost all meeting and I think

1065
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,119
dinner D was also scheduled and then

1066
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:16,050
ended up getting be scheduled so we

1067
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,859
almost had all of the meeting here and

1068
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:20,230
one of the things that struck me about

1069
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:21,819
the Scopes of those is that they're they

1070
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:24,520
don't really overlap but there are a lot

1071
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:26,589
of places where you know there's kind of

1072
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,970
grey areas maybe between coin and some

1073
00:53:26,589 --> 00:53:29,980
of the stuff that might come out of pan

1074
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:32,560
RG eventually and between coin and

1075
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:35,290
energy and you know all of these in T to

1076
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:38,770
T and part of like they're all kind of

1077
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:40,300
looking at the same sort of problem

1078
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:42,550
space which is what's next for the

1079
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,740
internet with an internet focus but from

1080
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:47,680
different perspectives that would not

1081
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:49,029
work at all in the IETF like having two

1082
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,828
working groups working on exactly the

1083
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:56,589
same thing is an excellent way to annoy

1084
00:53:50,829 --> 00:54:01,900
the IES g.v I hear a couple of XE area

1085
00:53:56,589 --> 00:54:06,009
directors laughing the the idea of the

1086
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:07,630
IRT F is sort of a lab for the IETF um I

1087
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,160
think you actually do see it in the set

1088
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:10,540
of research groups that we have right

1089
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:14,170
now I really like um

1090
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:15,910
Derk suggestion very like so it actually

1091
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:19,270
was I'm really jet like one of the two

1092
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:20,680
of you just said this um about like hey

1093
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,030
we have to we have to be a little bit

1094
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,098
bolder about allowing things to fail

1095
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:25,240
right like so or like you know let's

1096
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:27,700
spin it up and let's have a look at it

1097
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:29,169
and the the idea that the success is

1098
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,399
something's going to come out of this

1099
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,750
it's gonna go into standardisation

1100
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,819
shouldn't be the goal and maybe I'm just

1101
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:37,420
saying that because I'm a co-chair of

1102
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:39,880
panner G which has like a very very very

1103
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,230
long time scale for anything that might

1104
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,000
ever

1105
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:47,130
I'm out of that and be standards right

1106
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,900
um so yeah I think the the let's keep

1107
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:51,720
throwing things at the wall and see what

1108
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:54,530
sticks model works pretty well I think

1109
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:57,450
we've done a pretty good job of avoiding

1110
00:54:54,530 --> 00:55:01,040
an anti-pattern that that may have

1111
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:04,169
showed up at the past that was you know

1112
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,990
the an a research group as your

1113
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:08,880
consolation prize for a failed ball I

1114
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,129
think continuing to push back on that

1115
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,900
ante pattern as a good and I also say

1116
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:17,369
that as a co-chair of energy the the I

1117
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,060
think pushing back on my ninety pattern

1118
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:22,410
is a good many continue doing so um yeah

1119
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:30,440
I think we're actually doing a pretty

1120
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:32,730
reasonable job here launched a value I

1121
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:36,570
think this is a very important question

1122
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:40,080
to for the I re f and I each you have to

1123
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:41,640
discuss maybe we can also consider not

1124
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,590
necessarily already two stage where

1125
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,839
there is a research group being proposed

1126
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:48,660
but more there is a research question or

1127
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:52,050
a research topic and how and where it

1128
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:55,200
could be addressed I mean maybe I rgf an

1129
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:56,670
IETF of some ways of seeing the world or

1130
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,839
approach problems but they may be also

1131
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:03,810
wider scope if we think itu-t HC other

1132
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,880
groups or even I mean other organization

1133
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:08,609
not the silly standards related may also

1134
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,200
be other opportunities to the stage of

1135
00:56:08,609 --> 00:56:11,640
the lifecycle of a research idea or

1136
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,100
research report or you can go to four

1137
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,859
different groups and be marshal at some

1138
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:20,069
stage and then may be brought up to the

1139
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:22,890
IHF and maybe go somewhere else so I

1140
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:24,750
will consider very important ISAF IETF

1141
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:27,000
but maybe also try to widen a bit of

1142
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:28,710
scope because there may be other groups

1143
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,530
or stakeholders I could have good views

1144
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:35,030
or good competency in progressing a

1145
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:38,609
research idea in the whole ecosystem

1146
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:40,200
yeah I mean certainly a lot of the

1147
00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:42,540
research groups have historically had

1148
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,919
pretty close links to academic

1149
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,570
conferences in the area

1150
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,070
I guess the network management group

1151
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,620
would be one of them but it's certainly

1152
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,420
not the only one the the quantum

1153
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:54,220
internet group I think has recently

1154
00:56:52,420 --> 00:57:00,850
closed interactions with some other

1155
00:56:54,220 --> 00:57:04,660
conferences in that space too hi Steven

1156
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:06,310
Farrell so I think one of the does I

1157
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,500
think there's lots of good aspects of

1158
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:10,170
the IOT I've been close to the IETF one

1159
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,840
of the less good aspects I think is that

1160
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:17,530
research group chairs find it hard to

1161
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:19,060
deal with a lack of consensus in the

1162
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:20,530
IETF we're looking for rough consensus I

1163
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:23,020
don't that doesn't need to be the case

1164
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:25,180
in research groups but I think more and

1165
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:28,690
more it seems like there's a tendency to

1166
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:31,120
try and you know reach the same bar of

1167
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:32,910
rough consensus whereas I think research

1168
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,740
groups would sometimes be better

1169
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:37,990
publishing something that's whether it's

1170
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:40,029
a draft or an RC it means this is this

1171
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,350
person's opinion lots of people don't

1172
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:43,630
agree with it but it's still an opinion

1173
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:45,640
I think it would be good if research

1174
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:49,480
groups are more encouraged to allow that

1175
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,370
kind of lack of consensus yes I think

1176
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,230
that's a very good point you do not need

1177
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,650
research group consensus to publish an

1178
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:55,390
RFC

1179
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:57,310
you need to have an interesting document

1180
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:00,490
which the group thinks is worth

1181
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:03,009
publishing and the the IRS G agrees and

1182
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:05,350
as long as it's clear that this is an

1183
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:08,470
opinion piece rather than a consensus

1184
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:12,040
piece that's just fine maybe maybe it

1185
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:17,890
needs a bit more encouragement yeah you

1186
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:19,450
know equally research groups are not are

1187
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:26,430
not evaluated based on the number of

1188
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:26,430
RFC's they produce tall people

1189
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:37,490
one chocolate right on wow I forgot what

1190
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:46,130
I was gonna say oh I did forget I was

1191
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:48,830
gonna say - Jenna Inger so I won a

1192
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:53,119
second what Steven said I think it's

1193
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:56,990
valuable for RDF research groups to

1194
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:59,420
recognize that the processes of the IETF

1195
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:01,759
might be convenient because they are

1196
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:04,640
familiar but they're not necessary and

1197
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:08,180
we certainly shouldn't stick to them as

1198
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:12,859
though they are required I use I've just

1199
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:14,330
been considering how to as chair fic crg

1200
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:16,610
I've been trying to figure out how to

1201
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:18,799
publish documents in IC crg and what it

1202
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:20,630
means for us to publish documents and

1203
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,640
either in conversation with CF RG chairs

1204
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:24,710
and other folks and trying to understand

1205
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,810
that at the end of several long

1206
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:30,410
conversations the conclusion I came to

1207
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:32,480
was doesn't matter you do what

1208
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:34,460
you do and you publish something useful

1209
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,770
and ultimately whether it gets used or

1210
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:41,060
not is a function of a large number of

1211
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:42,800
things but our goal in ICC RG is to

1212
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:45,020
publish documents that are interesting

1213
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:48,260
that might be relevant and it's not so

1214
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:53,180
much to try and come up with one right

1215
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:55,490
answer for various things so I I want to

1216
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:59,109
just take a moment to say that it's very

1217
00:59:55,490 --> 01:00:01,459
useful I think for the IRT F to be

1218
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:04,940
associated with the IETF because it

1219
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:06,410
gives relevance it gives a space where

1220
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:08,359
we can understand problems from a

1221
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:10,250
practical point of view from what

1222
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:12,290
matters to the standards point of view

1223
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:14,810
at the same time I think it's also

1224
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:16,759
useful for the IRT have to be slightly

1225
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:18,710
independent of the IDF and to think of

1226
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,140
itself as independent from the ITF it

1227
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:22,609
doesn't need to be driven by ITF it

1228
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,920
doesn't need to be driven by things that

1229
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:26,750
will go back into the IETF or problems

1230
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:29,510
that are necessarily coming out of the

1231
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:30,950
IDF so it is an interesting space and in

1232
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:35,240
that I will just say one last thing

1233
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:36,950
which is it provides a venue it's not

1234
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,950
just the work that's happening in the

1235
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:43,160
research groups I see increasingly I see

1236
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:44,960
crg as a venue as a community

1237
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,810
where we are able to bring people in

1238
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:51,320
from from academia from the industry

1239
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:53,900
from standards areas I have people who

1240
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:55,510
come only for IC crg from the industry

1241
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:58,100
and they also happen to be in the IETF

1242
01:00:55,510 --> 01:01:00,050
but that's that's what I want to foster

1243
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:02,060
I want to have that community be built

1244
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:04,010
and the community to be available so

1245
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:06,200
that when we actually have problems in

1246
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:10,030
the IETF that needs this community we

1247
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,029
have the community available on hand I

1248
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:19,490
remembered what I was going to say you

1249
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:22,880
know we've talked about the IRT F not

1250
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:25,939
being a forum for advanced engineering

1251
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:28,700
within the IETF context but there does

1252
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:31,460
seem to be demand for that activity to

1253
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,560
take place somewhere that IETF working

1254
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,900
groups are very very narrowly scoped

1255
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,850
they have very specific deliverables but

1256
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:41,350
often people people want to talk about

1257
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:44,360
engineering problems more broadly and

1258
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:46,130
because there is not any place for that

1259
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:49,850
within the IETF I think that tends to

1260
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:52,670
push that into the IRC up a bit and it's

1261
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:54,860
really not within the irt of purview to

1262
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,660
deal with that but it is something that

1263
01:01:54,860 --> 01:02:01,340
I think we might want to be talking

1264
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:03,410
about with the IETF yeah an important

1265
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:05,360
point the the ITF works

1266
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:08,180
the IETF working groups are very

1267
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:10,730
narrowly scoped the IRT F is very blue

1268
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:13,040
sky and we've had a couple of

1269
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:15,410
discussions of you know there's a gap in

1270
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:19,610
the middle several people have mentioned

1271
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:22,430
this language I wanted to say the same

1272
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:24,740
thing and we can take an example of the

1273
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:28,250
network management research group and

1274
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:30,169
the net mod Netcom you know where one is

1275
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:31,670
very detailed in there down to the bits

1276
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:36,200
and pieces and the other one is very

1277
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:38,660
blue sky and sometimes challenging some

1278
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,730
of the thinking about in a new framework

1279
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:43,310
new architecture how to do things that

1280
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:46,340
are being done in the ITF getting such

1281
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:48,950
feedback from the IRT F would be useful

1282
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:51,080
and trying to say hey guys stop working

1283
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:54,109
on something that has been 20 years as a

1284
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,960
general accepted concept try to think in

1285
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:57,550
the industry terms and get

1286
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:02,280
some of those new thoughts from the

1287
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:04,930
Earth from the RTF would be helpful I

1288
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:07,300
you know I suspect the scheduling could

1289
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:08,890
be made to work if people want so you

1290
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:13,660
joined sessions to have these

1291
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:18,160
discussions hi this is Eve Schuler from

1292
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:21,520
Intel so I like this discussion a lot so

1293
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,799
thank you for bringing it up I it points

1294
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,660
out to me at least that in some ways

1295
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,839
this discussion around relationships

1296
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:32,440
with the ITF is around what's our metric

1297
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:34,540
for success in the IRT F and maybe one

1298
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:37,900
of the predominant ones is you know in

1299
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:39,910
forming the IETF but I it also raises

1300
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:42,250
the question or you know what are these

1301
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:44,259
other ones and some of the relationships

1302
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:46,960
that are spawning now among some of

1303
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:49,570
these other groups if you look at the

1304
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,820
research group thing to thing it has to

1305
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:53,710
do with sort of the broader community

1306
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:57,160
and many of the relationships with other

1307
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:59,290
standards bodies and so it just got me

1308
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,210
thinking about metrics of success and

1309
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:03,790
best known methods and things like that

1310
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:07,359
and I wonder if collectively as as a

1311
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:10,119
research community within the IETF we

1312
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:12,819
can catalog some of those and share some

1313
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:14,650
of those in terms of like what are our

1314
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:18,910
objectives as a community and then

1315
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:20,500
ultimately help the IETF more so just

1316
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:23,980
thinking out loud

1317
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:26,619
and recognizing that there there are

1318
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:31,300
more metrics to success beyond simply

1319
01:04:26,619 --> 01:04:33,970
the relationship with the IETF yes yes I

1320
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:36,490
mean I think that it's only true and you

1321
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:39,490
a research group does not is not

1322
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:43,930
necessarily expected to produce anything

1323
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:45,310
which would be useful to the IETF is

1324
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:48,399
that it's there to understand the

1325
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:52,119
problem space is learnt there to have to

1326
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:55,450
explore some ideas produce some new

1327
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:57,609
knowledge and occasionally that is that

1328
01:04:55,450 --> 01:05:01,419
leads to that leads the group to a place

1329
01:04:57,609 --> 01:05:03,279
where another effort can be spun up in

1330
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:05,290
the IETF to then standardize something

1331
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,270
based on that outcome but that's that's

1332
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:09,880
not necessarily

1333
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:15,220
the metric for success although it's a a

1334
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:17,770
metric for success and yeah just just

1335
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:19,240
understanding a problem better producing

1336
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:21,190
a bunch of papers producing a bunch of

1337
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:25,140
PhDs it's a perfectly reasonable

1338
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:25,140
successful outcome for a research group

1339
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:33,009
so I think the points I I would like to

1340
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,619
highlight don't as a research group

1341
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:37,900
don't feel that you have to follow the

1342
01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:41,530
ITF process don't feel you have to have

1343
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:44,440
consensus it's often convenient to meet

1344
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:46,960
here and there's good reasons to meet

1345
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,760
co-located with the IETF because it

1346
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,110
gives nice discussions and interactions

1347
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:54,160
with the standards community and with

1348
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:57,160
the people building products but meeting

1349
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:59,830
other places you meet with conferences

1350
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:03,700
me to have workshops do whatever helps

1351
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:07,150
advance your research I'm sure Allison

1352
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:08,740
will remember that some years ago seem

1353
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:11,260
to remember the reliable multicast group

1354
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:13,299
meeting on the beach Inc and next to the

1355
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:14,619
sitcom conference so we can meet it we

1356
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,840
can meet in all sorts of places it

1357
01:06:14,619 --> 01:06:24,460
doesn't just have to be in a windowless

1358
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:26,290
meeting room next to an ITF meeting -

1359
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:29,200
mark I think actually that's very

1360
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:32,259
interesting remark because this also

1361
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:36,970
promotes the IETF in those other places

1362
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:40,060
so we talked a lot about how the IR gf

1363
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:41,919
maybe can contribute to the IETF but

1364
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:44,770
let's not forget that there's also

1365
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:47,980
another way around so that there's that

1366
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:50,050
that this is an opportunity to maybe get

1367
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:53,290
new people interested in what we are

1368
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:56,130
doing within the ITF as well so thank

1369
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:59,200
you for the you remark yes it's it's

1370
01:06:56,130 --> 01:07:01,869
it's a way of fostering discussion

1371
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,210
between the the industrial side and the

1372
01:07:01,869 --> 01:07:10,000
very academic side I think that's a very

1373
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:12,960
nice role all right it's next up is is

1374
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,960
it Erin or Laurent

1375
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:35,610
there we go there's not that much on the

1376
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:35,609
side now the other side there we go okay

1377
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:42,850
Ansem okay hi I'm Aaron Falk

1378
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:47,290
whoops slides going I can't talk without

1379
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:49,240
the notes so before Collin was I RTF

1380
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:51,250
chair and before Allison was i RTF

1381
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:55,200
cheering before Lars was I RTF chair for

1382
01:07:51,250 --> 01:08:00,790
about six years I was AI RTF chair and

1383
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:04,180
Colin asked me to and Laurent to work

1384
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:07,620
together to prompt some discussion on

1385
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:11,339
examples of IRT F ITF collaboration and

1386
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:13,509
so this is mostly one person's opinion

1387
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:15,700
maybe folks will disagree with some of

1388
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:17,680
these but I think there's a lot of

1389
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:20,439
different models that are represented on

1390
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:22,210
this slide of things that I think work

1391
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:24,700
well and some things I think are anti

1392
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:29,340
patterns and some which might or might

1393
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:32,649
not be good patterns some of you know

1394
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:34,590
probably more some cases I'm unsure in

1395
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:36,639
some cases I just don't know enough but

1396
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:38,620
so let me just walk through a few of

1397
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,150
these and maybe folks can add to them or

1398
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,340
come up with some other examples I think

1399
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:45,160
that the more that we can share best

1400
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:48,460
practices of how I RT F ITF

1401
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:51,430
collaboration works well the better it's

1402
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:52,870
going to be and you'll notice and the

1403
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:56,920
arrows don't always point in one

1404
01:08:52,870 --> 01:09:01,059
direction so I think a good recent

1405
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:04,390
example is the ICC NRG the congestion

1406
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:05,680
control I think I have an extra later

1407
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:10,120
yeah the congestion control research

1408
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:12,490
group I got it wrong but the congestion

1409
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:14,920
control research group has performed a

1410
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:16,689
valuable role in vetting congestion

1411
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:19,240
control proposals there was a time when

1412
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:21,490
people would bring their research

1413
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:24,639
project in congestion control to the

1414
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:28,059
IETF and ask them to ask us to put it

1415
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:32,590
into TCP which has a number of fallacies

1416
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:34,030
in it one of which the ITF doesn't

1417
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:35,800
standardize congest control at least it

1418
01:09:34,029 --> 01:09:36,830
didn't then I guess it's more down there

1419
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,190
now

1420
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:43,040
but also that there wasn't really the

1421
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:45,139
there's a lot of questions in terms of

1422
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:49,340
how things are going to work in the real

1423
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:50,630
world before you start to take a

1424
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,859
position as to whether it's something

1425
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:57,020
that you want to roll that into the

1426
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:58,760
internet and so that this research group

1427
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:00,740
was created and one of the valuable

1428
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,910
functions that they did was to bring

1429
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:03,740
together researchers who are familiar

1430
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:06,380
with congestion control and research in

1431
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:08,650
that area to evaluate proposals and then

1432
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:11,960
make some recommendations as to whether

1433
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:14,660
ITF protocol should support it a

1434
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:18,110
different example is in the delayed

1435
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:20,480
networking folks this was a fairly large

1436
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:23,059
research project multi-institution

1437
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:26,209
research project who wanted to see the

1438
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:28,400
protocols become standardized but there

1439
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:32,930
are a bunch of open issues and so a

1440
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:36,080
research group was created to to come up

1441
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:38,750
with a good kind of sort through what

1442
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:41,990
the research community had done and

1443
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:44,360
implemented and and out of that came

1444
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:46,040
some proposals for standardization and

1445
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,700
working a working group was spun up to

1446
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:51,170
standardize that so that was I guess

1447
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:54,200
that's a little bit more of a one-way or

1448
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:55,730
I guess maybe Stephen was there were

1449
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,230
there things that came out of the ITF

1450
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:58,940
working group that fed back into the

1451
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:01,879
research group No okay so that was one

1452
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:05,210
way era great network management

1453
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:08,780
research group I guess Lauren can

1454
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:12,440
comment too this was the proposals

1455
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:16,670
through there became part of the anima

1456
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:17,660
working group and the IETF see if RG I

1457
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:20,690
think we've already talked about a

1458
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:23,690
little bit that it prefers to gather a

1459
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:26,210
bunch of folks from the crypto community

1460
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:30,410
who aren't naturally participants in the

1461
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:32,990
ITF process who evaluate cryptographic

1462
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:36,380
proposals and make some recommendations

1463
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:40,370
that the ITF can then use to to evaluate

1464
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:41,540
protocols and so the I guess the way

1465
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:43,010
that I understand the security area

1466
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:46,310
works is they there's sort of a

1467
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:48,020
deference to the CFR g2 to give like a

1468
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:49,699
thumbs up or thumbs down on crypto

1469
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:52,159
proposals and so that's

1470
01:11:49,699 --> 01:11:53,419
that's sort of a you bringing in in an

1471
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:55,480
area of expertise that isn't really

1472
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:58,400
president the ITF but the ITF relies on

1473
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:01,730
quality in that area and so that's a

1474
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:05,360
sort of a a little bit like the the

1475
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:07,639
congestion control idea a couple of

1476
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,580
groups where there's there's a bunch of

1477
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:12,110
expertise in the research community

1478
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:15,170
which developer you know interesting

1479
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:16,880
ideas that's congestion control or

1480
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:22,340
crypto and demonstrate that they work

1481
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:24,020
and then the ATF groups so I think it's

1482
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:25,400
a it's a maybe a little more nuanced

1483
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:26,570
than that that in some cases if they're

1484
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,889
coming up with ideas I think in this

1485
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:30,139
case like see if Archie is there

1486
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:33,500
evaluating proposals that come from

1487
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:36,650
outside so if you so there's a vetting

1488
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:40,810
process that requires expertise that

1489
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:42,980
isn't present in the IETF yeah there's a

1490
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:45,800
if I remember right they seem to run a

1491
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:54,639
bunch of competitions we want an

1492
01:12:45,800 --> 01:13:01,219
algorithm to do this reliable multicast

1493
01:12:54,640 --> 01:13:05,330
is a fairly old or long-lived

1494
01:13:01,219 --> 01:13:07,670
activity in the ITF and I think that's a

1495
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:09,409
that's an example of research that

1496
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:13,760
turned into some standardization didn't

1497
01:13:09,409 --> 01:13:16,460
solve all the problems but there's some

1498
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:22,070
protocol work that came out of it there

1499
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:24,409
the peer to peer research group was kind

1500
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:27,559
of had a whole burst of energy I think

1501
01:13:24,409 --> 01:13:29,690
that came out of some issues in industry

1502
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:32,810
and then the research group was trying

1503
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:34,339
to come up with metrics for evaluating

1504
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:36,050
aspects of peer-to-peer protocols and

1505
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:37,100
then the alto working group came out of

1506
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:41,150
that so these are I think these are

1507
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:42,230
different kinds of success some let me

1508
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,309
go to the anti-patterns and then I'll

1509
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:44,809
come back to the uncertain ones and

1510
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:47,179
maybe that that'll be the start of some

1511
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:51,620
discussions so the nameservers research

1512
01:13:47,179 --> 01:13:55,250
group was kind of winding down when I

1513
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:58,340
came into the IRT F but for a long time

1514
01:13:55,250 --> 01:14:00,830
I had heard like that you know next

1515
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:03,050
generation DNS is happening in this

1516
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:05,570
research group and the research group

1517
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:06,830
was closed and never actually published

1518
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:08,809
anything and so I think that's an

1519
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:13,519
example of where nothing came into the

1520
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:17,650
IETF and so that wasn't a very effective

1521
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:19,610
way of collaboration you know that's

1522
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:21,049
like we've said in the last session

1523
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:23,780
that's not always the objective of a

1524
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:25,940
research group but I think and I think

1525
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:28,219
there there was a bunch of proposals

1526
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:29,719
that went into the ITF and then we

1527
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:31,070
redirected into this research group and

1528
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:32,989
then nothing came back so I think that

1529
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:35,320
that probably was a little bit of a

1530
01:14:32,989 --> 01:14:38,900
swing and a miss for the organization

1531
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:41,509
anti-spam research group I think that

1532
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:43,009
there there were hopes that there would

1533
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:48,320
be proposals for how to deal with spam

1534
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:50,420
that came out of this group I think that

1535
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:52,130
very little ITF activity actually took

1536
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:54,110
off from that I I'm happy to be

1537
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:57,620
corrective and I'm looking at Stephen I

1538
01:14:54,110 --> 01:15:01,519
don't know all right

1539
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:02,780
so uncertain hip was I think an

1540
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,719
interesting ITF activity there was a

1541
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:09,620
bunch of energy in the hallways to to

1542
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:12,350
implement hip hip was a proposed as an

1543
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:14,030
alternative architecture for addressing

1544
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:20,390
a bunch of problems at the time in the

1545
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:23,120
ITF and they tried a few bars to get

1546
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:25,699
work going in the ITF I think that that

1547
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,710
was my opinion as it was proposed as a

1548
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:30,320
little bit too sweeping in terms of what

1549
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:31,730
they were trying to accomplish and for

1550
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,650
that reasons it sort of bounced off that

1551
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:34,669
you know we charter working groups if we

1552
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:36,980
think that they're focused and they're

1553
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:38,719
gonna you know have narrow goals and

1554
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:41,419
accomplish those goals in a in a

1555
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:44,480
reasonable amount of time and so then

1556
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:47,960
they became a research group and I think

1557
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:49,429
that it there's been some people

1558
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,980
implementation but I don't think it had

1559
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:53,330
the deployment that they had hoped for

1560
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:55,070
do you want to comment now Allison or we

1561
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:57,080
yeah I'd like it if you define

1562
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:59,750
uncertainty because you're starting

1563
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:02,630
uncertain with hip saying didn't really

1564
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:04,310
succeed and when you and I had a little

1565
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:08,270
exchange about this in the email I'm

1566
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:12,550
Allison Macon it was you said it didn't

1567
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:15,570
really mean that so well so

1568
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:18,510
my feeling is that this is a that this

1569
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:22,960
characterization is I'm uncertain about

1570
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:26,139
it to me it is isn't is not obviously a

1571
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:28,780
good example or a bad example of IRT F

1572
01:16:26,139 --> 01:16:31,320
ITF collaboration and so I think it's a

1573
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:34,030
little bit of a mixed bag so I feel like

1574
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:39,610
hip I don't think is a clear example of

1575
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:41,800
like it working really well and but it

1576
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:43,449
is an example of something that was sort

1577
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,219
of there was stuff happening in the IETF

1578
01:16:43,449 --> 01:16:46,629
and in the IRT F so there was some

1579
01:16:45,219 --> 01:16:48,820
collaboration so I'm uncertain as to

1580
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:50,619
whether I would call it a good example

1581
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:55,150
or necessarily something that we should

1582
01:16:50,619 --> 01:16:58,989
an anti-pattern so that's the mic okay

1583
01:16:55,150 --> 01:17:03,129
great so the routing research group is

1584
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:04,030
this is a when I came in to the IRT if

1585
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:07,270
they were our own research group had

1586
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:09,849
been around for a long time and I think

1587
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:12,489
that it was not a good example of

1588
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:15,190
collaboration in that what I saw of it

1589
01:17:12,489 --> 01:17:17,019
was that proposals that the ITF didn't

1590
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:20,919
want to deal with were redirected to the

1591
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:25,150
routing research group oftentimes that

1592
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:30,100
they would just not come to the ITF the

1593
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:33,519
end end research group and I think is I

1594
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:35,710
oh so I put this in the worked well

1595
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,119
column based on your comments and I

1596
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:39,310
think that Colin didn't get my updated

1597
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:41,219
slides so let me let me speak as if it

1598
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:43,810
was in the worked well column because

1599
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:46,840
your comment I was persuaded by your

1600
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:48,489
earlier comment Ellison that it was it

1601
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,110
was an example of a bunch of research

1602
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:55,839
activity that found its way into the

1603
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:59,320
IETF in I think a less it was a much

1604
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,749
longer lived research activity and so is

1605
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:04,299
less sort of

1606
01:18:01,749 --> 01:18:06,999
not the same kind of example of

1607
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:08,380
something that was focused like DTN but

1608
01:18:06,999 --> 01:18:10,380
something where there was a you knows a

1609
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:13,989
lot of research that happened over time

1610
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:15,550
it was a close research group and so it

1611
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,808
was kind of indirect and how things came

1612
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:18,400
out of the research group and into the

1613
01:18:16,809 --> 01:18:20,010
ITF there were a few examples of drafts

1614
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,089
but there were also research papers and

1615
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:23,679
implementation projects that came in and

1616
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:25,090
so it's a very different animal than

1617
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,229
some of the other stuff in the left-hand

1618
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:30,550
column but I do think it's a good

1619
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:34,380
example of of the collaboration and then

1620
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:39,610
the Q IRG it was a very open-ended

1621
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:41,679
measured in decades and so qrg I put in

1622
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:45,339
here because it's new it's uncertain but

1623
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:47,860
I think that it's a so I don't want to

1624
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:51,639
say yet that it's it is a great example

1625
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:53,018
of of IRT F IETF collaboration because

1626
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:55,090
there's really been very little IETF

1627
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:57,459
activity except for the fact that there

1628
01:18:55,090 --> 01:19:00,249
was a QA RG tutorial which was very

1629
01:18:57,459 --> 01:19:04,929
popular and so if you want to look for a

1630
01:19:00,249 --> 01:19:06,969
different kind of pattern of ITF IRT of

1631
01:19:04,929 --> 01:19:09,219
collaboration a sort of an education

1632
01:19:06,969 --> 01:19:11,380
approach of like here's an interesting

1633
01:19:09,219 --> 01:19:16,439
research area that is related to

1634
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:19,599
networking and and may have eventually

1635
01:19:16,439 --> 01:19:22,300
activities in the IETF but in the in the

1636
01:19:19,599 --> 01:19:23,619
near term is a source of information and

1637
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,840
educating and sort of raising the clew

1638
01:19:23,619 --> 01:19:27,489
level and ITF participants then I think

1639
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:33,039
Qi RG is sort of an interesting example

1640
01:19:27,489 --> 01:19:37,539
of that so at this point the one thing I

1641
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:40,268
would add and it really did it was a

1642
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:43,619
task force before it was a peer of the

1643
01:19:40,269 --> 01:19:46,150
ITF so it was a different animal indeed

1644
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:49,749
when it first started out and for like

1645
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:51,848
20 years but to be clear the people who

1646
01:19:49,749 --> 01:19:54,909
might not know it incubated our entire

1647
01:19:51,849 --> 01:19:57,820
media you know if the internet media

1648
01:19:54,909 --> 01:20:01,478
protocols it incubated diffserv and

1649
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:04,329
incubated ecn all kinds of stuff that we

1650
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:06,219
wouldn't have without it so what kind of

1651
01:20:04,329 --> 01:20:09,219
thing could be like that in future I'm

1652
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:11,739
not sure maybe nothing but it was

1653
01:20:09,219 --> 01:20:14,199
actually very high impact on the ITF

1654
01:20:11,739 --> 01:20:15,820
just quite different from the research

1655
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:24,169
groups we have

1656
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:26,059
yep I do card I have to kind of agree

1657
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:29,060
with your characterization of hip in

1658
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:31,970
terms of a burst of promising activity

1659
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:34,310
and then a long dormant period but I

1660
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:37,190
would like to say that the rumor of hips

1661
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:39,860
death is greatly exaggerated and I think

1662
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:43,070
the reason that it may not have been a a

1663
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:45,170
poster child for IRT F a ATF transition

1664
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:48,320
is that perhaps it transitioned a little

1665
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:52,070
early before there was a clear

1666
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:55,400
application pole for the technology but

1667
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:59,200
the the trustworthy multipath remote

1668
01:20:55,400 --> 01:21:02,420
identification baath tomorrow morning is

1669
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:05,809
application pole for which we think hip

1670
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:08,680
is actually an excellent fit hip in our

1671
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:14,870
time very exciting

1672
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:16,940
Christian at the time there was some

1673
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:21,680
research group that were closed

1674
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:24,440
membership and some that were open did

1675
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:26,360
you observe any kind of relation between

1676
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:29,719
the fact that something was closed and

1677
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:32,120
its success or not well two of the

1678
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:34,880
groups on here the only two that I know

1679
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:40,070
of a closed groups are on this list so

1680
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:41,330
the name nameservers research group NS

1681
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:43,150
RG I can't remember if nameservers is

1682
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:46,670
the credit correct expansion but the

1683
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:48,080
names research group was closed and then

1684
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:49,670
also end end research group was closed

1685
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,380
and so I think we've got both sort of a

1686
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:55,070
positive and a negative example so I

1687
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:56,420
don't think we can draw conclusions also

1688
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:58,040
that this is pretty far back I don't

1689
01:21:56,420 --> 01:22:00,760
think that there have been any closed

1690
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:06,040
research groups in recent memory

1691
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:08,060
everybody's shaking their head so but I

1692
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:09,860
think Christian you raised a point that

1693
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:11,210
I wanted to make earlier on in the in

1694
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:15,740
the discussion on the last section which

1695
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:17,540
is there's an enormity F is very canary

1696
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:19,460
constrained process because we want to

1697
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:21,350
be open transparent and standards

1698
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:23,120
organization the IR tiff has none of

1699
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:24,980
that and there's a lot of flexibility in

1700
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:27,290
how research groups that can operate and

1701
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:28,280
there and that discretion is typically

1702
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:30,650
given to the research

1703
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:33,110
group chair to organize it in a way that

1704
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:36,829
you know keeps the energy up and

1705
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:39,469
accomplishes stuff and so well making a

1706
01:22:36,829 --> 01:22:41,389
group closed is one aspect of that but

1707
01:22:39,469 --> 01:22:42,980
there but meeting in other locations is

1708
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:44,809
another piece of that and I don't know

1709
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:46,669
if it's still the case but but it was

1710
01:22:44,809 --> 01:22:47,840
for a while the only requirement was

1711
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,820
that you should meet once a year at an

1712
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,949
ITF meeting to promote some

1713
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:53,210
collaboration and cross fertilization of

1714
01:22:51,949 --> 01:22:55,009
ideas but other than that you can pretty

1715
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:59,900
much do what you want I think that's a

1716
01:22:55,010 --> 01:23:02,059
great thing so I was gonna comment on a

1717
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:04,369
couple of things first end to end as a

1718
01:23:02,059 --> 01:23:06,980
closed research group is gonna leave

1719
01:23:04,369 --> 01:23:10,460
people with the wrong impression it was

1720
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:14,178
closed in that membership and

1721
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:17,599
participation was by invitation only but

1722
01:23:14,179 --> 01:23:20,809
the chairs were incredibly crucial in

1723
01:23:17,599 --> 01:23:25,849
figuring out who to invite and reach out

1724
01:23:20,809 --> 01:23:26,960
to and move forward so that was quite a

1725
01:23:25,849 --> 01:23:28,550
bit of the other thing was going to do I

1726
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,500
think it's probably mostly on your on

1727
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:31,550
your next slide so you're gonna get to

1728
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,809
that or do you want to talk I wasn't

1729
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:34,460
actually gonna present prevent the next

1730
01:23:32,809 --> 01:23:35,989
slide that was more sort of reflection

1731
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:38,000
on stuff and I thought that the the

1732
01:23:35,989 --> 01:23:39,169
discussion the reflection from the folks

1733
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,270
in the room was probably more

1734
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:42,530
interesting than they so if you want to

1735
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:44,989
go to the next slide we can well haven't

1736
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:46,489
got a glimpse your next slide I think

1737
01:23:44,989 --> 01:23:49,400
the different forms of transfer is

1738
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:51,049
really insightful because what happened

1739
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:54,500
you're the first bullet there basically

1740
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:56,659
is an incubation it's pre standards and

1741
01:23:54,500 --> 01:24:00,110
the goal is to spawn standards activity

1742
01:23:56,659 --> 01:24:01,759
and a group that started that way needs

1743
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:03,199
to have the courage to say we've done

1744
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:06,429
the job we're getting out of business

1745
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:11,480
the second line is an area of

1746
01:24:06,429 --> 01:24:14,449
overlapping expertise where for both ICC

1747
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:17,329
RG and CFR G you can identify a

1748
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:19,519
community of expertise strongly ground

1749
01:24:17,329 --> 01:24:21,710
and research that is complementary to

1750
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:24,349
the standards work that we do here and

1751
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:27,050
that's a really good structure because

1752
01:24:24,349 --> 01:24:28,820
it avoids inflicting the research on the

1753
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:30,380
protocol development and the protocol

1754
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:35,150
developed practicalities on the

1755
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:37,280
researchers Laurel should get credit for

1756
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:38,629
making most of the slide since it's so

1757
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,009
insightful then I agree with your

1758
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:44,119
comments

1759
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:45,709
what's hurt occur I say one other good

1760
01:24:44,119 --> 01:24:46,969
thing that came out of it and when when

1761
01:24:45,709 --> 01:24:49,429
you're totally done I have a much longer

1762
01:24:46,969 --> 01:24:50,900
thought train to expound upon for for

1763
01:24:49,429 --> 01:24:53,630
both the previous presentation and this

1764
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:55,848
one but the NMR G was also actually the

1765
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:58,340
route for net coffin yang and it was a

1766
01:24:55,849 --> 01:25:01,369
short-term model that you know certainly

1767
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:02,959
heavily affected the ATF today and you

1768
01:25:01,369 --> 01:25:06,949
know it started as sort of a fairly

1769
01:25:02,959 --> 01:25:08,690
short project of two to three years that

1770
01:25:06,949 --> 01:25:10,610
it was too long to do in the IETF and

1771
01:25:08,690 --> 01:25:12,558
and the research you know is the right

1772
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:14,268
place for it to start and then it

1773
01:25:12,559 --> 01:25:16,579
certainly transformed a lot since then

1774
01:25:14,269 --> 01:25:18,860
but it's a great tech transition story

1775
01:25:16,579 --> 01:25:21,670
thanks Wes I wasn't involved in that so

1776
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:29,150
it's helpful to know it's been sir

1777
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:33,670
please finish your slide I don't feel

1778
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:33,670
the need to say anything else okay

1779
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:43,849
devran I you focused on a bunch of

1780
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:46,719
things in the IR TF that have had for

1781
01:25:43,849 --> 01:25:48,499
better or worse interesting

1782
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:50,360
characteristics in their interaction

1783
01:25:48,499 --> 01:25:52,579
with the ITF there there are a few of

1784
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:54,199
the things here where we also want to

1785
01:25:52,579 --> 01:25:57,139
look at our failure models as well as

1786
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:59,360
our success models and I can think of at

1787
01:25:57,139 --> 01:26:02,449
least a few research groups which I will

1788
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:04,670
not name that were that wound up getting

1789
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:06,228
chartered and then we discovered that

1790
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:09,979
there actually weren't any interesting

1791
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:13,699
research problems and they bounced

1792
01:26:09,979 --> 01:26:15,110
around for a while and they were they

1793
01:26:13,699 --> 01:26:18,440
couldn't produce a standard because they

1794
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:20,119
weren't in the ITF and yet we discovered

1795
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:23,268
that what was happening in those

1796
01:26:20,119 --> 01:26:25,280
research groups wasn't research so one

1797
01:26:23,269 --> 01:26:28,820
of the things I think we do need to sort

1798
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:31,820
of guard against is allowing groups to

1799
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:33,619
keep going on and on and on with not

1800
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:35,478
understanding what the boundary is and

1801
01:26:33,619 --> 01:26:37,820
there actually aren't any interesting

1802
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:40,400
research problems in that domain that

1803
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:44,900
could drive a research agenda so just

1804
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:47,150
the word of caution there right so so I

1805
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:51,199
guess my first response to your comments

1806
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:52,989
is that that's that's for the discussion

1807
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:57,070
before the this this is about

1808
01:26:52,989 --> 01:27:00,309
tf-idf disc collaboration but to respond

1809
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:02,559
to some of the groups which will go

1810
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:04,239
unnamed in facts were chartered because

1811
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,590
there were things that were believed to

1812
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:08,349
be needed in the research community

1813
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:10,870
there weren't ready for the IETF to deal

1814
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:12,250
with and that kind of collaboration with

1815
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:15,940
the thought that things might transition

1816
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:19,120
in the IETF were motivations for forming

1817
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:20,799
those groups so let me just reiterate my

1818
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:23,580
point there have to be interesting

1819
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:26,620
research problems independent of whether

1820
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:29,890
the output is something that winds up in

1821
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:30,940
the IETF or not wait this this to some

1822
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:35,380
extent is the difference between

1823
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:37,120
research and development we need to find

1824
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:38,680
interesting research problems not just

1825
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:41,920
interesting advanced development

1826
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:43,960
problems i well maybe you and I disagree

1827
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,760
on this but I think that there's room in

1828
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:47,350
the IRT F for both if there's an

1829
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:52,360
energized community that wants to work

1830
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:56,890
on it because I again my personal

1831
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:59,460
opinion is that the IETF succeeds with

1832
01:27:56,890 --> 01:28:01,690
things that are pretty well defined and

1833
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:03,070
there are things that are not very

1834
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:05,559
research II that may need more

1835
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:08,320
definition I think having them happen in

1836
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:10,570
the IRT F is okay but that's different

1837
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,790
from so I think that there's a lot of

1838
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:17,559
different kinds of things that can grow

1839
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:19,030
in the AI RTF and I think that I don't

1840
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:22,290
see a benefit to creating another

1841
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:26,309
organization to hold those things

1842
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:30,670
because sometimes it takes people with

1843
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:33,420
you know it's that research in an

1844
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:35,680
implementation collaboration that yeah

1845
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:37,239
this or the joint expertise that it

1846
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:39,700
takes to sort of get them over the line

1847
01:28:37,239 --> 01:28:41,679
so that they can be baked here something

1848
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:43,570
I don't disagree with Dave you know they

1849
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:46,270
don't always succeed I mean just the the

1850
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:48,580
list of concluded research groups for

1851
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:52,300
some value of concluded is much longer

1852
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:56,350
than the list of active ones of course

1853
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:59,500
because I think we need to be clear that

1854
01:28:56,350 --> 01:29:03,469
there is that we believe there are

1855
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:07,060
research issues before we transfer group

1856
01:29:03,469 --> 01:29:10,370
and you you're the boss yeah yeah my

1857
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:12,170
view tends to be that if it's just that

1858
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:15,320
it could be engineering it's just a

1859
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:17,900
longer term focus than a typical IETF

1860
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:20,540
group to me that that should be a

1861
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:24,170
perhaps a different type of atf activity

1862
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:25,340
i don't want to get into semantics on

1863
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:26,870
where you draw the line between research

1864
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:28,130
and engineering but i think it's i think

1865
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:31,340
it's hard to come up with an objective

1866
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:34,370
measure there's always a bunch of things

1867
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:36,140
in a gray area but but ultimately the

1868
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:40,640
judgment on whether it's in or not is

1869
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:44,630
yours that's somebody at the microphone

1870
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:48,980
say something yeah so spencer Dawkins

1871
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:51,199
and I wanted to I wanted to thank Colin

1872
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:53,299
for putting this topic forward and Erin

1873
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:55,570
for doing this presentation I wanted to

1874
01:29:53,300 --> 01:30:00,320
cut down to your bottom bullet about

1875
01:29:55,570 --> 01:30:02,420
documenting this topic more precisely it

1876
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:08,449
seems like to me that one of the things

1877
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:11,180
when we succeed in research groups at

1878
01:30:08,449 --> 01:30:12,379
least some of the time we we do that by

1879
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:15,620
involving a lot of people that don't

1880
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:18,670
understand the IETF very well and that

1881
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:20,780
means that it makes transition hard

1882
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:22,670
especially if they don't know what's

1883
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:26,559
been tried before and what has been

1884
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:26,560
tried that it's worked out badly

1885
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:35,510
back in the day not very long after Lars

1886
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:38,690
became AI RTF chair he had me working on

1887
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:42,680
what became I think it's our C 74

1888
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:45,320
eighteen this the IRT F primer for IETF

1889
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:46,820
participants and what we were the

1890
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:50,900
problem we were shooting at back then

1891
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:52,009
was people coming from the IETF with you

1892
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:54,349
know the understanding of the IETF

1893
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:55,910
process and that's not the way the IRT F

1894
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:57,110
works and the thing I don't know it's

1895
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:59,420
like I don't know eight or ten pages

1896
01:30:57,110 --> 01:31:01,610
long something like that it's not it's

1897
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:04,250
not very long but it like it has the

1898
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:08,150
list about you know scope and timeframes

1899
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:11,570
and you know participation and and

1900
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:12,769
meeting places and stuff like that but

1901
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:14,299
that was the problem that we were

1902
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:17,969
dealing with that was the problem the

1903
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:21,959
chair of the IRT F was dealing with the

1904
01:31:17,969 --> 01:31:23,399
and it seems like to me that because we

1905
01:31:21,959 --> 01:31:26,010
don't have the same research groups now

1906
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:28,469
and we don't have the same ITF and we

1907
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:30,119
don't have the same IRT of chair it

1908
01:31:28,469 --> 01:31:33,780
seems like the problems that the IRT

1909
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:36,509
have chair is facing now is more the you

1910
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:38,669
know getting things slotted in the right

1911
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:41,749
place in the first you know the first

1912
01:31:38,669 --> 01:31:45,090
balance so that it's not the fail buff

1913
01:31:41,749 --> 01:31:51,289
consolation prize that people tried to

1914
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:54,919
make it and and and how you know just

1915
01:31:51,289 --> 01:31:58,648
documenting what the models are you know

1916
01:31:54,919 --> 01:32:01,409
DT NRG basically kind of picked up

1917
01:31:58,649 --> 01:32:05,610
stakes and move to the ietf you know

1918
01:32:01,409 --> 01:32:07,530
that's a model other people have bottles

1919
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:10,320
like ICC RG which is a completely

1920
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:12,869
different model I would I would caution

1921
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:16,349
against trying to make this very precise

1922
01:32:12,869 --> 01:32:18,598
because the research groups are really

1923
01:32:16,349 --> 01:32:20,340
this you know the scopes are big whether

1924
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:22,949
the we research groups are big or not

1925
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:24,809
and they're really different you know

1926
01:32:22,949 --> 01:32:27,329
and we don't have a lot of them to

1927
01:32:24,809 --> 01:32:29,849
basement to base quite you know criteria

1928
01:32:27,329 --> 01:32:32,459
on but just even right down you know

1929
01:32:29,849 --> 01:32:36,809
what is what happened in the past and

1930
01:32:32,459 --> 01:32:39,780
how it turned out which is oddly the

1931
01:32:36,809 --> 01:32:41,489
paint RG draft on what not to do

1932
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:44,070
you know it's kind of doing for a path

1933
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:47,968
aware networking but to basically do the

1934
01:32:44,070 --> 01:33:02,129
same kind of thing for the IOT F and the

1935
01:32:47,969 --> 01:33:05,550
IETF interaction did you say ten minutes

1936
01:33:02,129 --> 01:33:08,399
a couple of minutes okay

1937
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:10,260
all right I can go on for ten minutes so

1938
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:11,579
you know I think looking at both the

1939
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,840
last two talks right there they're very

1940
01:33:11,579 --> 01:33:14,820
informative and how do we think about

1941
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:16,739
the IRT F over the over the longer term

1942
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:18,449
and especially working groups and and

1943
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:20,339
when they're successful and there's a

1944
01:33:18,449 --> 01:33:22,799
real a challenge there because there's a

1945
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:25,050
width issue right IRT F groups need to

1946
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:26,410
span from you know far-reaching research

1947
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:28,120
that you know it

1948
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:29,650
looking out in far distant future to

1949
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:32,980
stuff that needs to transition you know

1950
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:35,129
fairly quickly and actually specifically

1951
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:38,259
transition to application and real

1952
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:40,930
interoperability and so you know you can

1953
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:43,060
look at results as you know we look to

1954
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:44,410
we measured this really cool thing we

1955
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:47,680
found out that nothing needs to change

1956
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:49,120
that's still a success right we've

1957
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,440
looked at a problem space and we found

1958
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,880
that there is a problem we're creating

1959
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:54,370
new work or a new working group out of

1960
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:56,500
it that's great and we have improvements

1961
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:59,050
and suggestions and that got transferred

1962
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:01,960
into you know into protocol changes you

1963
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:03,640
know on the wire so that's the easy

1964
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:05,500
thing but the thing is is the success

1965
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:07,450
possibilities for a research group are

1966
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:10,480
so wide that it might actually be easier

1967
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:12,160
to look at what do we not want and so I

1968
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,929
have a couple of examples of that of

1969
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:15,940
which in you know research groups that

1970
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:17,470
that fail might include research groups

1971
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:20,410
to produce new documents I think you had

1972
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:22,390
an example of that research groups that

1973
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:24,910
looked at a problem space found a

1974
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:27,850
solvable problem but failed to find an

1975
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:29,710
audience right where it just sort of

1976
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:31,960
fell on deaf ears and then that would be

1977
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:34,090
a problem and similarly you know deaf

1978
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:36,190
ears when you discover protocol

1979
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:38,320
deficiencies in existing stuff based on

1980
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:40,809
research that failed to actually

1981
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:43,570
transition to fixes and like actually

1982
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:44,950
they're present the winner presentation

1983
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:46,660
from today is a good example of that I

1984
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:48,670
was trying to figure out where where can

1985
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:51,180
we get that fixed and if it doesn't get

1986
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:55,410
fixed that to some extent of failure I

1987
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:58,810
would say the most insidious example of

1988
01:34:55,410 --> 01:35:03,090
something that doesn't belong in the IRT

1989
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:06,690
F is a you know a particular company

1990
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:10,560
proposal that is trying to create

1991
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:13,179
something that looks like an open forum

1992
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:15,520
but doesn't have a constituency that I

1993
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:17,800
saw several examples of that when I was

1994
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,930
I our TF chair and I think that was the

1995
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:21,280
that it's like okay maybe there's

1996
01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:23,170
interesting work here but it's just like

1997
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,550
your little narrow thing there's nobody

1998
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:25,600
who wants to collaborate with you you

1999
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:27,520
know and so we're not gonna create a

2000
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:30,730
group for you no matter how many people

2001
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:32,220
you have show up so but I you know I

2002
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:36,339
think your examples are good as well

2003
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:38,360
Eric not mine so listening to you guys

2004
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:39,679
debating on stage sort of the boundary

2005
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,780
between research and advanced

2006
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:45,139
development I mean I think that there is

2007
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:47,599
this other space where waters the idft

2008
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:50,090
versus the IRT F when there's some new

2009
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,679
work coming in and people sort of have

2010
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:53,929
some vague notion that there might be

2011
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:56,030
something here but the proponents don't

2012
01:35:53,929 --> 01:36:00,949
seem to be able to describe it very well

2013
01:35:56,030 --> 01:36:02,630
or sort of you know it's is it because

2014
01:36:00,949 --> 01:36:05,419
they don't understand the problem space

2015
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:07,310
the solution space the constituents but

2016
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:08,920
but it's rather vague right and those

2017
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:11,929
things get tossed around and sometimes

2018
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:13,960
might depend on an IRF chair is someone

2019
01:36:11,929 --> 01:36:15,560
that might have landed in the Iron Chef

2020
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:17,210
other times

2021
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:21,409
the ADEs have worked with these people

2022
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:22,940
for some times for many ITF meetings to

2023
01:36:21,409 --> 01:36:26,989
try to sort of distill something out of

2024
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:28,820
it sometimes the IAB or an IB member

2025
01:36:26,989 --> 01:36:30,949
gets appointed as a shepherd to try to

2026
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:32,690
help them and maybe CID leads to barf or

2027
01:36:30,949 --> 01:36:35,089
something but that's one of the

2028
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:37,070
challenging spaces work we believe that

2029
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:39,619
we want to be open and invite this new

2030
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:41,809
work but but it's not necessarily that

2031
01:36:39,619 --> 01:36:43,519
well formed and I'm not arguing that

2032
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:46,010
that should land in the IHF it's just

2033
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,989
that we collectively should you sort of

2034
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:50,239
figure out a way of handling that I

2035
01:36:47,989 --> 01:36:51,678
supposed to it being bounced around but

2036
01:36:50,239 --> 01:37:05,269
I think that's an excellent point do you

2037
01:36:51,679 --> 01:37:08,960
have a proposal no time for it on the

2038
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:10,730
bottom to sub-bullets I think it's

2039
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:13,310
always good to like write things down

2040
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:15,080
but want to be careful to make sure that

2041
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:18,560
it doesn't become a requirement that all

2042
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:20,330
research must successfully transfer and

2043
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,940
the learnings I think if written from

2044
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:25,340
the ice see if our G side versus re from

2045
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:27,290
the research side versus the ietf side

2046
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:29,119
they might be very different which would

2047
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:30,679
also be interesting yeah it's a good

2048
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:33,110
point I should have added a column on my

2049
01:37:30,679 --> 01:37:35,360
chart that was no transfer and it was

2050
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:36,440
still a great thing because there's a

2051
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:38,000
bunch of research groups especially

2052
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:40,780
they're active now that fall into that

2053
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,360
category okay thank you everybody

2054
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:45,830
yep so thank you Erin and yes to be

2055
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:47,070
clear that there is absolutely no

2056
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:49,940
requirement that

2057
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:54,239
anything transitions in standardization

2058
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:55,440
you know we as a research group you you

2059
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:59,549
know the idea is to develop some ideas

2060
01:37:55,440 --> 01:38:01,259
some technology a group of people may

2061
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:02,820
look at the outcome of a research group

2062
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:06,480
and say this is appropriate for

2063
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:08,519
standardizing they may not and it's a

2064
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:10,759
successful way as long as we learned

2065
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,760
something

2066
01:38:25,139 --> 01:38:29,580
all right so having spent some time

2067
01:38:26,969 --> 01:38:32,190
talking about how the IRT F and the ietf

2068
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:34,830
can interact a little bit about how the

2069
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:39,299
IRT F and the broader academia can

2070
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:41,280
interact hi it's me again and for the

2071
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,750
people who started hearing me at 7:15

2072
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:47,759
this morning I promise it's the last

2073
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:52,699
time so this started I mentioned when I

2074
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:55,170
did the coin presentation that we had to

2075
01:38:52,699 --> 01:38:57,540
interims and this discussion actually

2076
01:38:55,170 --> 01:39:00,510
started that our last interim in October

2077
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:02,190
and we figured out that it was a topic

2078
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:04,050
that was much bigger than a research

2079
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:07,070
group it was something that was for the

2080
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:10,500
whole IRT F so I would like to thank

2081
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:12,269
everybody and the coin community Jana

2082
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:15,030
talked about communities well that's one

2083
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:16,920
of them and especially Lars who sent us

2084
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:21,300
a set of very interesting slides and

2085
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:26,429
actually I borrowed one so that were the

2086
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:28,350
comments academics do not do drafts good

2087
01:39:26,429 --> 01:39:30,719
point

2088
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:33,510
attendance from professors and students

2089
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:35,639
is often very difficult for questions of

2090
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:39,150
budgets and because you know we seem to

2091
01:39:35,639 --> 01:39:42,659
be the roaming conference here and it's

2092
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:45,690
true you know it costs money we need to

2093
01:39:42,659 --> 01:39:51,089
do a better job of connecting academia

2094
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:53,070
and I RTF I agree the other inputs one

2095
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:55,530
of them was from Colin was that well

2096
01:39:53,070 --> 01:40:00,210
there's more than drafts the drafts is

2097
01:39:55,530 --> 01:40:03,449
the IETF way of moving forward but maybe

2098
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:06,110
there's something else and maybe the

2099
01:40:03,449 --> 01:40:09,030
typical draft format is ill-suited for

2100
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:12,389
for research discussions and also the

2101
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:15,389
typical draft presentation format at a

2102
01:40:12,389 --> 01:40:18,150
lot of IRT F meeting we would like to

2103
01:40:15,389 --> 01:40:20,760
know the progress of the research or the

2104
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:23,879
new IDs in research not just a delta

2105
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:27,600
from the last version of the of the

2106
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:29,520
draft so we decided that okay let's

2107
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:31,080
let's get some thoughts around this and

2108
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,909
let's look also what happened in the

2109
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:35,159
past and I promise someone that was

2110
01:40:32,909 --> 01:40:38,129
going to discuss this but a few years

2111
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:40,349
ago I was on an HDR evaluation

2112
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:45,540
in France for somebody who had an

2113
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:47,910
impeccable what a way of applying for

2114
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:50,130
this I didn't even know how we could say

2115
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:52,830
that this person was not going to get

2116
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:56,310
this and then one of the reviewers said

2117
01:40:52,830 --> 01:40:59,809
but look at his publication record he's

2118
01:40:56,310 --> 01:41:03,860
got eight RFC's but not a lot of

2119
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:06,330
publications and my you know my first

2120
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:08,670
thing was that he's got you know wow

2121
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:11,160
that's that's amazing and that if you

2122
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:13,710
think of the usual people who read a

2123
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:16,559
conference paper there's three think of

2124
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:19,620
how many people read a draft because

2125
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:22,680
before it becomes an RFC and the the

2126
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:25,680
amount of comments that you get from all

2127
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:28,860
kinds of people from all kinds of

2128
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:31,410
sources and you know I thought it was

2129
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:34,620
amazing but it was actually highlighting

2130
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:37,080
a fact that in academia people do not

2131
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:42,300
really understand what a draft a

2132
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:43,769
northerner FC is so the top concerns was

2133
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:45,570
again that these draft and

2134
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:48,240
standardization in general but we were

2135
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:50,969
IRT F we don't do a standardization but

2136
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:53,070
that drafts are poorly considered in

2137
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:55,680
academic circles well probably because

2138
01:41:53,070 --> 01:41:57,750
people don't know what they are the

2139
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:59,910
other point was that we needed to have

2140
01:41:57,750 --> 01:42:02,520
more dissemination of the research group

2141
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:07,019
activities a lot of people don't know we

2142
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:09,240
exist or have a very they know maybe one

2143
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:10,830
research group exists but they don't see

2144
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:14,219
how it fits you know with this whole

2145
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:16,170
ecosystem of you know internet research

2146
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:23,010
and they were the travel and the

2147
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:24,690
participation aspects well it's well

2148
01:42:23,010 --> 01:42:27,420
I'll go back actually because the first

2149
01:42:24,690 --> 01:42:29,700
thing that I think was very easy to to

2150
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:31,080
resolve on the even on the call was was

2151
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:32,760
the travel because you know more and

2152
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:35,340
more there's people who are

2153
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:37,350
participating remotely to this and if

2154
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:39,780
it's not for the 13 hours ahead or the

2155
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:42,180
16 hours ahead or waking up at 2:00 in

2156
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:44,309
the morning to attend a meeting you can

2157
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:46,800
participate remotely and that won't cost

2158
01:42:44,310 --> 01:42:50,800
you anything so that was for me was mote

2159
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:55,150
the other ones were much more important

2160
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:57,670
so writing a draft is not necessary to

2161
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:58,900
participate in the orgy meeting you know

2162
01:42:57,670 --> 01:43:02,410
we don't put like if you don't have a

2163
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:05,559
draft on command it's not the case we've

2164
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:07,710
had a number of academic presentations

2165
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:11,880
and I know a you know a lot of other

2166
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:14,620
research group have had that I think the

2167
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:17,560
networking prices and the workshops are

2168
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:19,420
exactly the right type of example of

2169
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:22,000
research that was done somewhere else

2170
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:26,680
that is actually now brought to this

2171
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:29,230
community and we really welcome grad

2172
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:31,990
student postdoc and again I mentioned in

2173
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:34,269
our presentation that we participate in

2174
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:36,190
the hackathon and I will be honest with

2175
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:39,250
you when we participated in the

2176
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:42,339
hackathon in Montreal was actually to to

2177
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:45,820
have a lot of the local grad students

2178
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:47,170
being able to come and see how it was

2179
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:48,849
going as a whole because in the

2180
01:43:47,170 --> 01:43:50,890
hackathon you have all the groups are

2181
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:52,840
there and it was actually to enhance

2182
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:57,430
this participation from the local

2183
01:43:52,840 --> 01:44:00,970
universities and another thing is again

2184
01:43:57,430 --> 01:44:05,040
I mentioned this draft perception kind

2185
01:44:00,970 --> 01:44:05,040
of uneven but if you think about it

2186
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:13,180
mindsets are hard to change and some

2187
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:16,090
suggestions were that maybe we should

2188
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:18,970
state better their research challenges I

2189
01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:21,520
think a lot of times on our wikis on the

2190
01:44:18,970 --> 01:44:23,770
github and even on the Charter were very

2191
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,140
very focused on something we would like

2192
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:29,080
the group to achieve but maybe not how

2193
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:33,640
it fits in the greater world of the

2194
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:37,320
research challenges for this field we

2195
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:40,420
could invite participation of people

2196
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:42,610
actually I thank Dave last time in

2197
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:44,140
Montreal he had suggested a researcher

2198
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:47,139
in Chicago who had a fantastic

2199
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:51,940
presentation and was essentially had

2200
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:53,830
been invited for this co-locate actually

2201
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:56,830
people mentioned this and co-locate

2202
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:58,900
enter a meetings or even meetings during

2203
01:44:56,830 --> 01:45:02,800
conference that are related to the field

2204
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:04,179
and organize workshop and there's

2205
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:07,330
actually a great present

2206
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:09,490
from lorries on bridging the gap between

2207
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:14,340
internet standardization and networking

2208
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:14,340
that he presented in Brazil other ideas

2209
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:22,980
maybe create and then share specific use

2210
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:25,810
cases and data on the wiki and and

2211
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:28,450
basically create leverage not just for

2212
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:30,310
one research group but maybe link to

2213
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:33,010
what other research group are also doing

2214
01:45:30,310 --> 01:45:35,550
so that people can start navigating

2215
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:35,550
through it

2216
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:41,680
add some research group topics in

2217
01:45:39,070 --> 01:45:45,219
academic seminars and presentation I

2218
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:48,250
will try that we're doing ICN 2020 in

2219
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:50,200
Montreal and we want to add some

2220
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:52,000
presentations some seminars and

2221
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,260
workshops that go across a number of

2222
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,930
things and see how we can actually

2223
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:58,000
disseminate not just one research group

2224
01:45:55,930 --> 01:46:00,070
ICN but maybe also the one the other one

2225
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:07,720
I'm involved with coin and that we're

2226
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:09,580
coding and maybe we always say you can

2227
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:11,380
actually take your research and bring it

2228
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:14,850
into a draft well why don't do the other

2229
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:19,930
way around also take some of the draft

2230
01:46:14,850 --> 01:46:22,230
examples or the draft presentations or

2231
01:46:19,930 --> 01:46:26,640
the draft writings and bring them into a

2232
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:26,639
paper and Aaron has a question

2233
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:31,870
Aaron Faulk I lots of good stuff here

2234
01:46:30,190 --> 01:46:35,440
you say it's nice to meet you outside

2235
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:39,940
can bridge five thousand meals away one

2236
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:43,480
one idea that I've seen that is not on

2237
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:45,040
here is something the nm RG implemented

2238
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:47,980
which is that they did pre-publication

2239
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:49,570
reviews of papers and I think they

2240
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:52,660
needed some confidentiality to be able

2241
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:55,480
to do that but there was a my

2242
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:56,860
understanding is that folks perceived

2243
01:46:55,480 --> 01:47:01,929
that as being a real benefit and the

2244
01:46:56,860 --> 01:47:02,620
papers improved good idea are you

2245
01:47:01,930 --> 01:47:04,870
finished

2246
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:07,120
no there's three more slides and maybe

2247
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:08,710
my question will be your question will

2248
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:10,360
be answered but you know please ask you

2249
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:13,900
a question if it's further I'm going to

2250
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:16,740
say yes well I don't want to prevent you

2251
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:16,740
finishing so

2252
01:47:16,810 --> 01:47:21,140
quickly antidote right I actually was

2253
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:22,940
told recently in a year that I had zero

2254
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:24,080
academic papers and a couple of RFC's

2255
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:27,440
that you know that wasn't good enough

2256
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:29,240
and so I get that that particular issue

2257
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,950
and then this year I actually have two

2258
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:33,980
really good academic papers and zero

2259
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:35,870
RFC's because the RFC's are taking that

2260
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:37,490
much longer than that much harder to get

2261
01:47:35,870 --> 01:47:38,930
through the system and I'm now going on

2262
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:41,380
like working group last call number

2263
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:44,150
three because people really care and so

2264
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:45,890
you're absolutely right I think one of

2265
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:47,240
the fundamental problems though is no

2266
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:51,590
matter how much of these other things

2267
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:54,260
you do the ietf and the IRT F are not

2268
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:57,530
listed on the academic you know grading

2269
01:47:54,260 --> 01:48:00,170
scale of conferences from A to F I think

2270
01:47:57,530 --> 01:48:02,210
it's on the I think it's uneven I think

2271
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:04,340
in in some circles it is well known and

2272
01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:06,620
others it's not and it's I think it's

2273
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:08,840
our it's our goal to make it maybe gap

2274
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:11,380
bridge that gap yeah I wanted actually

2275
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:13,340
other comment because in my case my

2276
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:15,590
supervisors I absolutely know what the

2277
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:17,870
ATF is since is I actually helped create

2278
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:19,400
it so you know the knowledge of not

2279
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:21,349
understanding it isn't a problem it's

2280
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:24,019
just from the academic you know grading

2281
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:26,770
perspective yeah I think it's

2282
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:29,810
interesting the way different countries

2283
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:31,730
evaluate the research you know in in in

2284
01:48:29,810 --> 01:48:36,290
some places research impact is very

2285
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:38,030
heavily assessed and the ITF activities

2286
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:44,630
cancel a lot more than in other regions

2287
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:48,679
I also make I'm inspired by your bullet

2288
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:51,860
about vision or blue sky papers and it

2289
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:55,040
struck me from some of my past time like

2290
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:58,280
at NSF that fields have like 10 year

2291
01:48:55,040 --> 01:49:00,560
horizon planning that they do a little

2292
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:02,900
bit formally but that is very valuable

2293
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:05,840
for those fields in terms of getting

2294
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:07,700
funding and maybe that's another way you

2295
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:11,480
could do this is is have kind of

2296
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:14,870
informal review here and RG is free but

2297
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:16,759
lending itself to that kind of consensus

2298
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:18,830
about what big open directions are that

2299
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:24,710
could be helpful for the community

2300
01:49:18,830 --> 01:49:27,800
academic community thank you Dan

2301
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:30,170
Bogdanovich so I'm looking at this sec

2302
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:32,210
you know idea invite participation in

2303
01:49:30,170 --> 01:49:36,610
research groups and IDs from leading

2304
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:39,590
academics let's have a regular ITF

2305
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:41,290
participant contributor how can you know

2306
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:43,400
who are the leading you know

2307
01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:45,920
participants usually how we know people

2308
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:48,080
come and volunteer this we find out who

2309
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:50,960
is interested in the area that you know

2310
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:54,890
that we are doing some work yeah well I

2311
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:57,320
think I think okay the next problem well

2312
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:59,450
I think I'll sound like a social media

2313
01:49:57,320 --> 01:50:02,360
guru here or some kind of influencer but

2314
01:49:59,450 --> 01:50:04,130
we all are at the center of especially

2315
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:06,469
in this research world we're all at the

2316
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:08,720
center of a large number of connections

2317
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:10,640
and we know who are the leaders in our

2318
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:12,470
group in a world and we can actually

2319
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:14,090
reach out to them and if they cannot

2320
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:15,770
come because you know for a reason they

2321
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:16,910
can a lot of times people are really

2322
01:50:15,770 --> 01:50:20,060
nice and they're going to suggest

2323
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:22,010
somebody else so I think we should we

2324
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:23,450
should not think that the world is

2325
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:26,090
limited to this room you know the world

2326
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:29,120
is is all around and connected in a

2327
01:50:26,090 --> 01:50:31,910
hundred ways so I actually strongly

2328
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:34,160
believe that you know if we invite you

2329
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:37,460
know every time I've invited somebody in

2330
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:37,910
this environment even when they couldn't

2331
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:44,300
come

2332
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:45,680
they actually suggested someone else you

2333
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:48,200
wrote that line at the bigger at the

2334
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:50,600
bottom Eve so about the vision and blue

2335
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:53,830
sky page yes is yours it's because I

2336
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:56,240
keep seeing that conferences

2337
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:57,800
increasingly are including vision and

2338
01:50:56,240 --> 01:51:01,580
blue sky papers and they are often

2339
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:03,740
invited papers so you know it's in some

2340
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:06,620
ways like a free pass into a conference

2341
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:09,830
and it's super fun but I wanted to go

2342
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:12,290
back to the point about how do we get

2343
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:16,550
the academic community to change their

2344
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:18,530
perception that the RFC's aren't as are

2345
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:20,930
more important you know at least we want

2346
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:23,349
equal grounding right or we want people

2347
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:26,360
to be rewarded for it and I wondered

2348
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:28,910
whether in the same way that vision and

2349
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:30,860
blue sky papers are around fostering

2350
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:33,590
looking further ahead and that's what

2351
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:36,440
the IRT F does whether we can reach out

2352
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:40,020
to some of the communities like and I'm

2353
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:42,780
from the US so this is a us-centric

2354
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:45,510
idea but it translates to other gos if

2355
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:48,330
we go to places we have organizations

2356
01:51:45,510 --> 01:51:50,850
like the NSF and like DARPA and you know

2357
01:51:48,330 --> 01:51:53,550
the Army has some you know they're

2358
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:54,860
they're structures in place about what

2359
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:57,060
are the organizations particularly

2360
01:51:54,860 --> 01:52:00,809
government-funded that are looking at

2361
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:03,060
the challenges of connectivity and so

2362
01:52:00,810 --> 01:52:04,980
forth and having a seat at that table

2363
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:08,250
and that's where the academics see that

2364
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:11,009
we've seen at the table and so and I

2365
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:16,650
think yeah I think there is an example

2366
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:18,960
of how this works I'm old enough to have

2367
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:22,049
come to the IETF where it was really

2368
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:25,560
only us people and I'm also reviewer on

2369
01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:27,390
the European research projects the well

2370
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:28,950
that was called age 2020 but it was

2371
01:52:27,390 --> 01:52:31,170
called all kinds of other things before

2372
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:32,910
and at one point somebody put in some of

2373
01:52:31,170 --> 01:52:36,300
the outcomes and dissemination was

2374
01:52:32,910 --> 01:52:38,639
participation in the Internet IETF and

2375
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:42,060
suddenly the rise of Europeans in the

2376
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:44,490
end in the IETF went that way and I

2377
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:46,410
think maybe there's some similar thing

2378
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:49,170
that we could do in the IRT F to get

2379
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:51,840
more participation and my management was

2380
01:52:49,170 --> 01:52:54,510
that we can certainly go out and ask

2381
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:57,240
others to come into our community how do

2382
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:58,980
we go out and get him but I think it's

2383
01:52:57,240 --> 01:53:01,080
just I think it's a two-way thing right

2384
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:07,500
so that was more the nature of my yeah

2385
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:13,559
point and question Christian with Amma

2386
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:16,740
about the OFC and evaluation the offset

2387
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:18,780
Ito pushed a change in the AVI format

2388
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:22,019
couple of years ago Donna was a you

2389
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:25,200
noticed to have an oid reference on

2390
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:29,070
every RFC which was precisely to

2391
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:32,849
facilitate citations of RFC's in

2392
01:53:29,070 --> 01:53:36,240
journals and you can actually very

2393
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:42,180
easily count two citations of a given

2394
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:44,250
RFC on values libraries and I think that

2395
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:47,550
if we are concerned with that and you

2396
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:49,829
can use these citations as a way to give

2397
01:53:47,550 --> 01:53:57,760
weight to publications

2398
01:53:49,829 --> 01:54:01,630
yeah Thank You Marco an additional note

2399
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:05,649
related to this there is a very good

2400
01:54:01,630 --> 01:54:10,599
paper published in ACM CCR by prying

2401
01:54:05,649 --> 01:54:12,909
carpenter and great portraits that

2402
01:54:10,599 --> 01:54:15,219
discusses the role of the RSC's as a

2403
01:54:12,909 --> 01:54:20,249
scorer paper starting from how to cite

2404
01:54:15,219 --> 01:54:26,199
them thank you ok so I'm getting out of

2405
01:54:20,249 --> 01:54:28,360
Ohio I'm sorry so just quickly I'm

2406
01:54:26,199 --> 01:54:30,638
thinking that this presentation and also

2407
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:33,188
whether discussion is suffering a little

2408
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:37,630
bit from what we actually criticized

2409
01:54:33,189 --> 01:54:40,719
earlier so projecting so known methods

2410
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:42,610
of working from the IETF to IRT f

2411
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:44,409
research and then wondering oh why

2412
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:46,688
doesn't this work for academics so I

2413
01:54:44,409 --> 01:54:48,308
think you even mentioned standardization

2414
01:54:46,689 --> 01:54:50,649
on an earlier slide I mean this isn't

2415
01:54:48,309 --> 01:54:54,519
really not what this is about

2416
01:54:50,649 --> 01:54:58,030
and so our C's I mean that's an issue

2417
01:54:54,519 --> 01:55:00,130
that so we know that then that's like

2418
01:54:58,030 --> 01:55:04,749
our C takes some time but that's not

2419
01:55:00,130 --> 01:55:07,149
what we are doing in the energy f and so

2420
01:55:04,749 --> 01:55:10,148
I think what Dave mentioned earlier

2421
01:55:07,149 --> 01:55:13,780
that's really important that so there

2422
01:55:10,149 --> 01:55:16,899
are at least two criteria to be aware of

2423
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:19,570
so say some useful output for the IDF

2424
01:55:16,899 --> 01:55:22,780
and in some way but also I mean doing

2425
01:55:19,570 --> 01:55:25,389
really good relevant quality research

2426
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:27,518
and if you if we are not able to do that

2427
01:55:25,389 --> 01:55:30,760
no academic will find it interesting

2428
01:55:27,519 --> 01:55:34,499
yeah I know to come to us so and and for

2429
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:37,929
that I think it could be interesting to

2430
01:55:34,499 --> 01:55:41,079
discuss a certain indicators or say

2431
01:55:37,929 --> 01:55:43,300
models that seem to work well and also

2432
01:55:41,079 --> 01:55:48,639
maybe ask the question I mean what's the

2433
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:51,099
point of writing a draft or our C I mean

2434
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:55,209
there must be some you know some utility

2435
01:55:51,099 --> 01:55:58,829
to that and so what I think is really

2436
01:55:55,209 --> 01:56:00,360
useful is see this as a means to enable

2437
01:55:58,829 --> 01:56:04,799
experimentation so

2438
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:06,450
to be able to you know take the you know

2439
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:09,420
academic research I read how are things

2440
01:56:06,450 --> 01:56:11,370
and you know keep people honest and make

2441
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:13,290
things comparable and then try to gain

2442
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:16,950
some insights out of that and this is

2443
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:21,140
where our model is useful so writing up

2444
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:24,540
specs in a sense and looking at that and

2445
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:27,950
so I would kind of maybe turn us around

2446
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:35,550
and ask what are good indicators and

2447
01:56:27,950 --> 01:56:36,870
good models thank you Jana anger I'll be

2448
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:43,170
quick

2449
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:45,180
I agree that traps have a use but you

2450
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:46,650
point out that IRT of draft perception

2451
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:49,470
in the academic world is uneven at best

2452
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:52,969
I would argue that any draft perception

2453
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:55,710
in all worlds is uneven at best just to

2454
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:58,770
not a belabor the point but even I ITF

2455
01:56:55,710 --> 01:57:00,210
drafts are all over the place you can

2456
01:56:58,770 --> 01:57:03,090
have an independent submission you can

2457
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:04,890
have an informational RFC you can have

2458
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:06,510
RFC's that have had review that I

2459
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:09,420
haven't have as much review as we

2460
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:12,000
believe and the IDF is completely you

2461
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:14,280
know it's it's much more there's much

2462
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,350
more variance in I already after have

2463
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:18,420
certain errors in the IDF drafts and in

2464
01:57:16,350 --> 01:57:21,150
that sense as an academic who's tried to

2465
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:24,720
who's gotten tenure based on on

2466
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:27,360
publications I couldn't rely on on RFC's

2467
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:30,150
and that's just a fact of life it's it's

2468
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:33,030
not I don't think it's reasonable to

2469
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:34,769
expect academics to to do for us to

2470
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:37,139
change the perception because not a

2471
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:39,480
perception issue it is like it's a real

2472
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:42,570
issue in the sense that the the goals of

2473
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:44,790
what we do here tend to be different

2474
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:47,099
than the goals of what academic

2475
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:51,060
publications tend to be and my question

2476
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:53,460
to you is why why is that the case

2477
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:55,680
because we want to foster good research

2478
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:59,270
if you look at the papers that are

2479
01:57:55,680 --> 01:58:01,650
always presented out of the the

2480
01:57:59,270 --> 01:58:06,740
networking prizes and everything it's

2481
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:09,330
always top notch stuff so it makes no

2482
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:12,330
you know we're not doing second-rate

2483
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:14,099
stuff here and I think that's that's

2484
01:58:12,330 --> 01:58:16,380
actually part of the perception

2485
01:58:14,099 --> 01:58:18,300
so maybe so the second point I was gonna

2486
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:22,260
make might speak to what you just what

2487
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:24,060
are you just asking I I want to I I

2488
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:25,800
won't disagree with the fact that we do

2489
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:27,449
research in the research groups I'll

2490
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:31,770
disagree with this personally I think

2491
01:58:27,449 --> 01:58:33,449
the foster research well yes I think

2492
01:58:31,770 --> 01:58:35,280
there's a very important distinction and

2493
01:58:33,449 --> 01:58:37,860
the distinction here is but our

2494
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:39,659
participants do research well so I'll

2495
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:41,460
give you an example right in IC crg I

2496
01:58:39,659 --> 01:58:43,379
think we foster research what that means

2497
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:45,360
is there are groups that go off do

2498
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:48,150
research publish come here and present

2499
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:49,799
what they've done yeah and they'll keep

2500
01:58:48,150 --> 01:58:52,379
coming back and doing stuff they don't

2501
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:54,150
use us as a publication venue we as a

2502
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:57,750
research group aren't publishing one

2503
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:59,989
thing but we are engaging with various

2504
01:58:57,750 --> 01:59:02,340
entities various groups students

2505
01:58:59,989 --> 01:59:03,869
industry groups that are publishing on

2506
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:05,940
their own but we are creating an

2507
01:59:03,869 --> 01:59:08,460
environment where they all come talk and

2508
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:09,960
we have a forum for that to happen so as

2509
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:11,909
a research group I think we foster

2510
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:14,219
research I don't think we are a

2511
01:59:11,909 --> 01:59:16,259
publication venue but I think we should

2512
01:59:14,219 --> 01:59:19,980
be clear about the fact that we are

2513
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:22,739
allowing and encouraging and and making

2514
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:27,209
the research happen but the metrics

2515
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:31,530
shouldn't be publication all right David

2516
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:33,239
I want to go beyond and emphasize I

2517
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:35,519
think even more strongly what John it

2518
01:59:33,239 --> 01:59:39,178
was was getting at I mean I do research

2519
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:41,429
I run an an orgy I participate in RG if

2520
01:59:39,179 --> 01:59:43,139
I have some super great idea I'm not

2521
01:59:41,429 --> 01:59:44,400
going to take it to an orgy I'm going to

2522
01:59:43,139 --> 01:59:46,920
write a paper and I'm going to get it

2523
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:49,739
through a double-blind program committee

2524
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:52,260
and convince people that this is this is

2525
01:59:49,739 --> 01:59:54,199
super novel and something that's going

2526
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:57,270
to change the world

2527
01:59:54,199 --> 01:59:59,070
what are G's are I think going to be

2528
01:59:57,270 --> 02:00:02,219
most successful doing is this

2529
01:59:59,070 --> 02:00:05,610
collaboration function right which is

2530
02:00:02,219 --> 02:00:07,230
because academics I got to tell you they

2531
02:00:05,610 --> 02:00:09,030
don't collaborate very well with each

2532
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:10,888
other they're forced they're forced to

2533
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:13,670
buy their funding agencies and if they

2534
02:00:10,889 --> 02:00:17,940
weren't forced to they wouldn't do it

2535
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:20,040
they you know so I Eve's here and she

2536
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:24,388
she may want to comment on this we have

2537
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:27,030
a really good joint project between NSF

2538
02:00:24,389 --> 02:00:27,659
and Intel that talks about Wireless edge

2539
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:30,659
computing

2540
02:00:27,659 --> 02:00:34,169
and ICM we have been I think we have a

2541
02:00:30,659 --> 02:00:36,058
absolutely perfect zero record of

2542
02:00:34,169 --> 02:00:38,400
getting anybody who was doing research

2543
02:00:36,059 --> 02:00:41,610
under that project to come and present

2544
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:44,280
it at either ICN RG or any of the

2545
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:47,969
wireless oriented research groups and

2546
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:52,259
the reason for that is that it's it's an

2547
02:00:47,969 --> 02:00:56,760
extra it's extra work for no particular

2548
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:58,489
benefit in those contexts so for me I

2549
02:00:56,760 --> 02:01:02,039
think we have to push this this

2550
02:00:58,489 --> 02:01:06,419
collaboration and community aspect of

2551
02:01:02,039 --> 02:01:08,489
the function of the IRT F and and make

2552
02:01:06,419 --> 02:01:11,219
our case based on that as opposed to

2553
02:01:08,489 --> 02:01:12,299
we're doing great research in the IRT F

2554
02:01:11,219 --> 02:01:14,489
Thanks

2555
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:16,169
yeah and and I think yeah I was always

2556
02:01:14,489 --> 02:01:18,178
thinking was that with it's not that we

2557
02:01:16,169 --> 02:01:20,699
do good research I think our partner is

2558
02:01:18,179 --> 02:01:27,239
good research so I'm thank you for for

2559
02:01:20,699 --> 02:01:30,388
correcting this yes Simon oh okay okay

2560
02:01:27,239 --> 02:01:32,280
so I switched a few things I skipped a

2561
02:01:30,389 --> 02:01:34,320
few things so I can I can see that

2562
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:36,300
obviously we can do better I really like

2563
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:38,249
the idea the fostering I really like the

2564
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,650
idea of the community communities and

2565
02:01:38,249 --> 02:01:42,329
actually I'm going to conclude with

2566
02:01:40,650 --> 02:01:45,150
something that I said this morning with

2567
02:01:42,329 --> 02:01:47,099
my first presentation at 7:30 what we

2568
02:01:45,150 --> 02:01:50,159
want to create an is Agora for people to

2569
02:01:47,099 --> 02:01:51,780
come and share and you know essentially

2570
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:53,339
have the rest of the community

2571
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:54,929
understand what they're doing why

2572
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:57,510
they're doing it and how we can create

2573
02:01:54,929 --> 02:01:59,999
even more research thank you all right

2574
02:01:57,510 --> 02:02:02,189
thank you very much thank you again to

2575
02:01:59,999 --> 02:02:03,989
waiting for the NRP

2576
02:02:02,189 --> 02:02:05,519
presentation thank you to everybody who

2577
02:02:03,989 --> 02:02:08,188
spoke later I think that's been a really

2578
02:02:05,519 --> 02:02:10,050
interesting discussion hopefully we can

2579
02:02:08,189 --> 02:02:12,320
continue this discussion throughout the

2580
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:14,669
rest of the week thank you everybody

2581
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:17,239
if you have the blue sheets please pass

2582
02:02:14,669 --> 02:02:17,239
them to the front

2583
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:25,690
you

2584
02:02:30,690 --> 02:02:32,750
you
