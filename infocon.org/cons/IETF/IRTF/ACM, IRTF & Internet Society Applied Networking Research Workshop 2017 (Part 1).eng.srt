1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,610
this year shared by it

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,500
Renato Teixeira and myself he record

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,709
Renata I couldn't make it to this

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,980
meeting which was which is unfortunate

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,300
but well we'll deal with this you don't

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,989
need too many people standing up here in

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,090
anyway since this is just our second

8
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:28,790
iteration I want to have a brief recap

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,770
on why where this came from though so

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:36,079
the entire workshop has been coming out

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:38,899
of a one eye our SG dinner event where

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,969
we talked about how to connect ITF and I

13
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,350
RTF and research people better so that

14
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:44,629
those communities have a chance to

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,079
mingle somewhat more and so we put

16
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:49,699
together this workshop being outlined as

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,699
a forum for research as windirstat and

18
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:55,099
so on to discuss emerging results in

19
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:58,010
applied networking research so the idea

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,710
is to find a place and enter framework

21
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,210
that allows scientific people from the

22
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,800
same academic community to actually

23
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,510
submit their work to a place that's

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,429
close enough that the follows peer

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,140
review guidelines and so on but is close

26
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,840
enough to an ITF to make it interesting

27
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,470
to maybe stay over and take part in the

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,970
remainder of the week and we are

29
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,720
particularly interested in applied and

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:26,900
results that would that could help us

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,140
influence add to or otherwise interact

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:33,560
with the ITF work and also with possibly

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,470
upcoming research group activities and

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,560
the IRT F so that's just the the rough

35
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,360
framework we are trying to run this on

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,670
the Saturday before the IDF's

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,830
the the first two occurrences have been

38
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,390
the summer ITF there's no need that this

39
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,600
would need to be the summer I'd here

40
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,790
this is something that we can surely

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,949
discuss later this afternoon and I'm

42
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,290
more than happy to take suggestions on

43
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,470
this me or other end members of the

44
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,110
steering committee so for this year's

45
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:06,560
edition we got 20 submissions which is a

46
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:08,568
bit lower than we expected we had each

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,550
submission reviewed by three PC members

48
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:15,500
we had a conference call to discuss and

49
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,020
and the end we decided to accept full

50
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,450
papers seven four papers two short ones

51
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:26,600
or three short ones sorry and one demo

52
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:28,730
and last year we had a relatively

53
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,350
crowded program which so we decided to

54
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,970
go this year to the towards the other

55
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,100
extreme so we have plenty of time for

56
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,500
discussion we have lots of people from

57
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,299
the ITF community here who are anyway

58
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,960
eager to discuss pretty much everything

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,990
all the time

60
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,390
so this would give us a good frame so so

61
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,690
feel encouraged well tell you when we

62
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:50,510
run bared it over all papers are

63
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,640
available open access on the workshop

64
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,519
site and in the ACM digital library and

65
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,070
again as for today's format and the

66
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,910
stuff that we had we're happy to take

67
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,890
feedback in the evening we have a

68
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,230
program committee of a crowd of people

69
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,029
who have been putting in cycles to do

70
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,799
the reviews discuss with each other so

71
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:15,440
that we could finally come up with a

72
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:18,590
conclusion of our program that's those

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,400
folks the ones whom you might be thanks

74
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:25,000
to all of them for reviewing the people

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,340
you might want to talk to about

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,010
suggestions for the workshop future

77
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,110
places volunteering to chair it and so

78
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,250
on as are those on the steering

79
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,650
committee with Ruslan

80
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:40,940
I got Medford Ellison Rankin Colin

81
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,650
Perkins and myself an important element

82
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,150
of our little workshop since we get

83
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,010
coffee breaks and they even are going to

84
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,490
have a reception in the evening is that

85
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:52,100
we get sponsors Akamai and Comcast have

86
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:55,370
been providing substantial support as

87
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:58,340
has the I sock and also sick home from

88
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,570
them we have received funding for

89
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:04,220
allowing to put out some travel grants

90
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:07,940
so we had handed out a few travel grants

91
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,710
our students applied one student

92
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,950
unfortunately could not make it in the

93
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:16,100
end due to bad circumstances in last

94
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,229
minute so what we have a few travel

95
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,640
grant recipients so thanks to all our

96
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:24,800
sponsors as well and then for our agenda

97
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,390
so this is a relatively relaxed one so

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,490
we have a few minutes left for the

99
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,949
opening

100
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,780
then we have three technical session one

101
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:34,729
on measurements one on transport that

102
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,318
also features a demo paper this demo

103
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:40,128
paper thing is going to be an experiment

104
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,690
the paper didn't quite fit as a full

105
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,000
academic paper what we figured it would

106
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,560
make up a nice demos but since this was

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,210
the only demo that we would have had

108
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,830
putting it somewhere in the corner and

109
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,299
hoping that somebody might notice didn't

110
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,460
seem to be a good idea so we'll do it

111
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,169
we'll try to do a full screen live demo

112
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:58,549
for for all of you and see how this goes

113
00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:00,979
then we'll have some lunch lunch will be

114
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,180
catered in one of the adjacent rooms

115
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:06,560
here so we don't have to walk around

116
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,449
very far um next session is then going

117
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,590
to be implementation and operations in

118
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:12,050
the afternoon and then we are going to

119
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,948
close with a panel on internet health

120
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,990
metrics

121
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:18,139
this came out of a submission that

122
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,789
Leslie dagger put in where we said this

123
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:20,930
is this is an interesting paper but it

124
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:25,099
but it would actually be much more

125
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:27,620
suited for a discussion round for a

126
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:29,599
panel and so we invited her to put

127
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,150
together a panel and she found three

128
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:34,279
happy panel members for us and we are

129
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,080
looking forward to this as a close of

130
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,800
the day we'll do a quick wrap-up and

131
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,270
then move to our reception so last year

132
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,460
this is probably hard to beat that

133
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,690
if you berlin put together a barbecue

134
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,880
somewhere outside i don't know what that

135
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:50,060
wanes because i couldn't attend it but

136
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,300
um so we had to do something more close

137
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,520
by and there was no companying ITF event

138
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,569
so we just go upstairs to our cloud

139
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,419
nines

140
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:01,270
sky bar and lounge from the hilton where

141
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:06,469
we are going to have some little bites

142
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:10,219
and some beers and related things so

143
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:12,710
that's we have this place starting at

144
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:15,349
1700 that opens officially for the

145
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,750
public at 1800 and we can stay there and

146
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:19,310
have our stuff till 1900 so this gives

147
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,960
us ample time and this would be the time

148
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,699
when we are eager to collect feedback

149
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,349
and a relaxed atmosphere on what you

150
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:29,840
like what you what you have in terms of

151
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:32,500
suggestions and so forth alright so we

152
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,989
have four papers and short paper talks

153
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,550
we are not going to do super exact

154
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,949
timing but we are going to our chairs

155
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,160
are going to watch the time somewhat so

156
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,420
we have

157
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,310
for the four papers 20 minutes for

158
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,200
presentations 10 for questions for the

159
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:51,970
short papers 12 minutes plus 8 for

160
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,979
discussion and interrupt the speaker at

161
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,110
any time when there's clarification

162
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,639
questions but keep fundamental

163
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,980
discussions about questioning the

164
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,940
methodology that was used and so on to

165
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,639
the end and since I said before we do

166
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,740
caught time so be interactive

167
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,630
one little requirement is we are being

168
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,840
live streamed and recorded by me to echo

169
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,340
so there's the camera and speakers

170
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,929
should stay somewhere in this range you

171
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,750
can walk around don't stumble across

172
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,400
this monitor and break something

173
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,630
especially on yourself and use

174
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,370
microphones if you've got questions

175
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,770
recorder why mic here we have this thing

176
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,640
for maybe the session chair and we have

177
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,469
one mic for the speaker

178
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,030
we'll see if we also get a clip mic so

179
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,740
far there is none but maybe we are going

180
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:40,388
to get one do we to be able to organize

181
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:42,970
one the IDF's

182
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:45,760
has a no dwell statement so we are being

183
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,950
recorded and live stream so think about

184
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,760
which political incorrect remarks you

185
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:56,710
want to make it might stick with you

186
00:07:50,760 --> 00:08:00,729
other than that other than that the ITF

187
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,900
IPI disclosure our rules don't apply for

188
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,030
contributions made for this workshop

189
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,039
because this isn't this is outside the

190
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,659
regular ITF it's just an Associated

191
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,099
event so you don't have to state

192
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,750
anything about patterns you might

193
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:33,940
knowing about about a topic you want to

194
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:37,349
discuss when you just turn it on which

195
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,349
we did earlier didn't show anything

196
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,800
okay and then then demo do it this way

197
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,220
you can take a quick look at this just

198
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,710
so we didn't have anything any any

199
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:17,540
feedback from week ago last year when we

200
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:23,330
were streaming this so therefore but we

201
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:29,780
can play with this final you want to

202
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:31,910
give it a try okay so in the meantime

203
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,920
anybody who has never attended an ITF

204
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,780
meeting before since I'm not see most of

205
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,839
the phaser - wow this is good

206
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,510
hooray this next question how many were

207
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,860
of you will be staying for at least

208
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,840
beyond the reception and the food for

209
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,530
true for tomorrow for at least one more

210
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:57,230
day doing this week oh just just off the

211
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:59,900
people who are so one two three

212
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:19,240
hooray for okay so we we have a few

213
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:22,010
people okay

214
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,310
final final questions how many who how

215
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:38,120
many of you do qualify a students also

216
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:39,949
from also us here bunch all right ok so

217
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,910
please practice doing this all right

218
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:46,339
thank you

219
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:50,769
okay then we have a plan okay this gets

220
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:52,749
us to our first session chaired by Maria

221
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:54,670
I'm staying up here for a second because

222
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:58,689
I have the first presenter slides on my

223
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:01,179
laptop so good morning everybody

224
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:03,759
so first session we have two short

225
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:07,480
papers and one long paper all around

226
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:09,999
measurements and the first paper is

227
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,369
actually joint work with some people in

228
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:14,410
my group and so I actually saw that our

229
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:16,360
student might be coming but nobody

230
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,009
managed to convince them I guess

231
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,489
so the first presenter will be Randy

232
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:23,110
Bush he's talking about some

233
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:25,269
measurements they did on the ripe Atlas

234
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,549
platform and I think this is follow-up

235
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:33,069
work on an IMC paper you had like last

236
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:35,259
year right I guess if you don't know

237
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:36,939
Randy Bush yet you should take the

238
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:51,249
opportunity to get to know him at this

239
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:55,209
workshop if you know me you know this is

240
00:11:51,249 --> 00:12:01,110
not my presentation my presentations

241
00:11:55,209 --> 00:12:06,248
have a mauve background and magenta type

242
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:08,559
comic sans this is a present this was

243
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:10,660
research the heavy lifter was Thomas

244
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:14,019
halter Bock who spent time with this

245
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,629
doing research at irj moved to a day at

246
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:19,119
Zurich etc etc so for the moment I'm a

247
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:22,299
member of the Zurich mafia but back to

248
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:31,990
the agenda for 20 points what was

249
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:35,459
missing on that agenda formal methods we

250
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:39,850
are standing on quicksand this

251
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:42,040
presentations measurement when serious

252
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,209
computer scientists are studying the

253
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:49,599
Internet as a behavioral phenomenon

254
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:53,109
you're in trouble enough for a political

255
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,079
statement so this work is a measurement

256
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,959
one as an example

257
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:03,089
ripe has 9800 probes out there which how

258
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,089
many people here use ripe Atlas yep

259
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:09,579
free to ask two years ago would have

260
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:12,850
been none 9800 probes out there which

261
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,620
one should I use it's a hard choice it's

262
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,710
like being in an American supermarket

263
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:20,680
near thrive 5000 brands of cereal

264
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:24,960
they're all the same and the box has

265
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:28,479
more nutrition than the contents okay so

266
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:33,180
the number of probes you I can use for a

267
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,770
particular measurement is limited okay

268
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,540
because they limited because the

269
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,030
platform doesn't want you to get too

270
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:44,260
greedy and do you really want to process

271
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:46,420
data from 9800 probes okay it's hard to

272
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,689
know which ones will satisfy a

273
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:53,050
measurement unless you specify and

274
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:56,020
that's difficult so finding a minimal

275
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,650
set of vantage point that maximizes the

276
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:05,310
chance of seeing what you want to see is

277
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:08,709
a fun game so they have categorical

278
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:12,160
categorical properties like this one is

279
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:18,940
behind the net where is it located a s

280
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:22,270
etc etc two probes the same a s can see

281
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,900
very different paths a s s despite the

282
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:27,760
religion are not homogeneous okay two

283
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:30,910
probes in different a s s can see

284
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,240
similar paths the same story geographic

285
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:37,480
locations and the other things so let's

286
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:42,420
propose that advantage points selection

287
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:45,010
method based on top a logic similarity

288
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,949
select the most dissimilar vantage

289
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:51,220
points if I want to see from as many

290
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:53,530
places as possible so like similar ones

291
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,840
if I want to concentrate on an

292
00:14:53,530 --> 00:15:01,180
observation and make sure it's not just

293
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:04,990
a problem with the probe etc okay so how

294
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,680
to find similarity how topologically

295
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:11,680
similar is where I've atlas overall and

296
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,380
how to exploit this okay how do we

297
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,420
measure it we define a similarity

298
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,780
metrics based on the jacquard

299
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,930
index of the set of IP addresses that

300
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,990
the probes observe when they trace route

301
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:30,339
to the same destination

302
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:33,880
okay so jacquard intersects is jacquard

303
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:37,930
inter index is known as intersection

304
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:40,330
over Union it's I've got a set of trace

305
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:44,140
routes have trace routes to the same

306
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:46,080
destination from two probes there's the

307
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,080
list of the addresses they pass through

308
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,930
if they pass through the same addresses

309
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:58,560
the intersection and the Union are the

310
00:15:52,930 --> 00:16:01,469
same so intersection over Union is one

311
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,000
if they bet dark materially different

312
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,950
intersection over Union is zero if

313
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,190
they're similar you get something in

314
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:12,280
between so if it's equal to one the pre

315
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:16,620
probe see the same IP past zero they see

316
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:20,530
different I feedback okay for each pair

317
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:23,190
we compute the jacquard index for all

318
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:26,740
the destinations they have in common so

319
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:30,790
this is something you run every month or

320
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:37,390
ten over the whole set of pros and they

321
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:39,339
do pairwise comparisons and of the only

322
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,220
those that have destinations in common

323
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:44,500
then and by the way when we do this when

324
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,620
I say we run it we don't actually run

325
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:51,010
new measurements there's tons and tons

326
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,320
of collected traceroute data some people

327
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,660
are using the Atlas probes to scan the

328
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,680
entire Internet we just exploit their

329
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:02,620
data okay so for each pair we look at

330
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:07,329
the 25th and the 75th and the median etc

331
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:10,540
and report results in a figure so this

332
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,129
is the e CDF of the probes this is the

333
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:16,540
show card similarity

334
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:18,310
this is percentile ranges you'll notice

335
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:24,190
I think that's even a slide for this

336
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:28,329
that about 10% probes are identical all

337
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:29,009
right your card index of one pretty cool

338
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:35,970
slope

339
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:41,080
so you can get half at about point four

340
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:46,389
so what we have is an a method that we

341
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:51,249
can measure dissimilarity okay and let's

342
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:53,590
check that against some reality we

343
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:55,600
expect to topologically similar probes

344
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,399
to being the same a s and geographically

345
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,820
close

346
00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:05,908
so here probes with there's a card index

347
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:09,340
of greater than point nine ipv4 the

348
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:11,409
geographic distance remember probes when

349
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,199
you set them up ask you where it is you

350
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:21,009
put that in there so you can tell there

351
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:24,669
are anomalies right but not that many

352
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:28,210
and in fact we've suggested studying

353
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:29,799
some of that and that'd be fun so when

354
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,740
they're in different day SS with a

355
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:35,559
jacquard index of 0.9 you can see the

356
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,629
index is high they're in different a SS

357
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:43,330
but they're still geographically pretty

358
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:45,428
close okay so topologically similar

359
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:50,019
probes tend to be in the same a s I know

360
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:54,749
we're all shelved and they tend to be

361
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:58,570
geographically close so we can take

362
00:18:54,749 --> 00:19:01,990
topologically sim similar probes to

363
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:05,678
think of them as a super probe ok we're

364
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:07,600
exploiting similarity so form probes

365
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:12,070
down you can run on another similar one

366
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,869
and if your measurements going to load a

367
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,700
probe too heavily or you're worried

368
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:19,299
about some other piggy researchers

369
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:22,720
loading that probe up you can throw it

370
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:27,039
over multiple probes and you compare the

371
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:31,570
data otherwise if I want to get a

372
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:35,950
diverse measurement I get topologically

373
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:38,908
dissimilar probes and if you compare

374
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:42,440
this what it discovers in topology

375
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:46,779
versus the right random supposedly

376
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:51,110
selection less methodology you get

377
00:19:46,779 --> 00:20:03,440
significant you get 25% better discovery

378
00:19:51,110 --> 00:20:04,668
and that's my song thank you God we have

379
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,340
question you have time for questions a

380
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:09,559
lot of time and I know and I have

381
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:22,070
prepared some mean questions for Thomas

382
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:36,918
but now he's not say one question I have

383
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:38,539
is like you so you make the statement in

384
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,480
the paper that this is better than

385
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:44,269
geolocation and and then you figure out

386
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,820
that actually a lot of notes that have

387
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:48,710
the same similarity are close by so do

388
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:52,580
you do you manage to make any assessment

389
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:55,250
it was really better or not is you're

390
00:20:52,580 --> 00:21:00,759
asking his geolocation better or worse

391
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,759
than jacquard index similarity yes no

392
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:13,668
let me turn this back on taking a look

393
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,830
at this the answer your questions no

394
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:17,960
cannot die further okay that would be

395
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,168
interesting to know anybody to be honest

396
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,899
this was the tail as you noticed in the

397
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:26,929
beginning of another project yes and

398
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:29,508
like looking at this light say is it

399
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:31,639
that all probes in the second set are

400
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:33,500
actually probe set have been probably

401
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:38,299
moved to the same a s and just not being

402
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:39,950
updated or or did you didn't look

403
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:42,230
further into the dead and although they

404
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,080
did not move the same way as you know it

405
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,899
a s is a by the addressing in the

406
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,980
traceroute okay right so they're just

407
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:56,800
look very similar right okay right now

408
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:59,330
we have about for instance when you look

409
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,270
when ripe themselves look at the probes

410
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:08,320
many are residential many are sitting

411
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:11,000
behind ho home Nats etc so in many I

412
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,980
don't want to say geographies but many

413
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,590
places in the world

414
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,360
there'll be smaller local providers with

415
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,909
their own AAS they all had the same

416
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,919
upstream yeah

417
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,990
makes it so they look like they're

418
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,980
different a s is here look maybe the

419
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:29,450
next top they're not yeah yeah I mean

420
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,500
would be but probably interesting to

421
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,970
look further into that

422
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,480
oh yeah there's more research I've done

423
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:51,470
here yeah oh for sure but I don't think

424
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:58,280
we're gonna do it I'll take this for now

425
00:22:51,470 --> 00:23:00,410
okay we'll work on the other Mike so I'm

426
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,680
curious how often what is a good

427
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:05,480
interval to recompute these indices I

428
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,040
mean routes to change and saw the

429
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,510
property underlying properties that you

430
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,170
observed by comparing the traceroute

431
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:13,790
sets do change and so did you look at

432
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,380
maybe what what happens if you look at

433
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,580
every day every day every month every

434
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,200
week and this would would there be a

435
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,300
sweet spot where you say okay this would

436
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,660
be a reasonable interval to recompute

437
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,629
those things if you want to spend a grad

438
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,430
student on this go for it

439
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,930
it's exploiting existing data so you're

440
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,210
not creating new measurements so you're

441
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:35,450
not doing you know you're not disrupt

442
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,700
being disruptive to the net so it would

443
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,920
be easy and fun to just compute it now

444
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,780
computed on data for six months old

445
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,820
computer on data for a year old and

446
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,980
looking the change in the data easy to

447
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:49,600
do I think I have something from our to

448
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:53,390
tell to my postdoc on that cool thanks

449
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,250
hello have two more questions okay so

450
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,250
how do you account for the unknowns

451
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,090
they're stars I'm at restaurant path

452
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:03,440
regarding the set of the IP addresses

453
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:05,240
and also when x addresses so as a router

454
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,680
responds on the same interface with

455
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,070
multiple virtual address we're not doing

456
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,350
it

457
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,899
or any of that stuff we're just looking

458
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,000
at stupid IP addresses so the gnomes are

459
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,200
cleaned up or they're not tonight

460
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,720
they're ignored okay

461
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:34,700
just having stars in both fruits does

462
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:36,650
not cause a match so and I apologize if

463
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:42,170
I said we hadn't had enough coffee yet

464
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:46,370
but I won Wow there will be a slight

465
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,870
break later on and so I'd like to

466
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,360
understand a bit better what your

467
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,280
definition of good is I mean implicitly

468
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:56,149
I understand or implicitly I take away

469
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,730
that the aim here is to use the minimum

470
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:01,070
number of Atlas probes to best represent

471
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:04,690
the full span of the internet for some

472
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,689
general sense of the Internet

473
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:18,949
okay

474
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:21,620
we didn't so if you don't know besides

475
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,740
these sets that I say help here at etc

476
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:29,409
we did not there's some fun stuff to be

477
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:32,450
done and yes we have ignored it in and

478
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:36,230
and there's good base work good theory

479
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:40,130
that we can apply to say to look at

480
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:44,270
measurement minimization right fess up

481
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:46,550
to not having done that and but right if

482
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,310
I ask it please run this for a bunch of

483
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:52,639
probes throws a bunch of probes at me if

484
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:55,399
I take the same number of rows I can get

485
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,500
a 25% improvement by being picky right

486
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,410
so I guess what I'm diversity what I'm

487
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,880
driving at is the right Atlas platform

488
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,710
is useful for any number of different

489
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,240
types of measurements and different

490
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,550
models of universe and I think you've

491
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,410
got a particular model is your aura yeah

492
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,820
you've got a particular model of

493
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,950
universe in terms of what you think is

494
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,960
good by contrast the work that I was

495
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,600
using ripe Atlas for that I'm not going

496
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,210
to talk about today I actually wanted to

497
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,510
get to distinguish between individual

498
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,600
networks so I wanted to use it to

499
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,730
measure

500
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,439
in individual networks and therefore I

501
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,570
wanted things that were more similar to

502
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,480
be clustered together so I'm just sort

503
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,939
of driving at the point that this is

504
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,870
this is good and right for a particular

505
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:42,919
model of the universe other models apply

506
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:48,110
first sure like this is a traceroute for

507
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:52,610
you it's not even a Geo view it's not

508
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:58,360
even in a s view etc this is hey I'm

509
00:26:52,610 --> 00:27:00,709
looking at topology and with traceroute

510
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:05,990
did this that little corner of the

511
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:08,030
universe hi Marcelo and you know thank

512
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:12,140
you for doing this I think this is very

513
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:13,970
useful and as an a-class user do you

514
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,860
think I mean are you planning to make

515
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,650
this available for other people to use

516
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,799
like when we are going to select

517
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:22,789
Prague's

518
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:26,330
it's so fun there sorry it's up on the

519
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:28,820
net but I'll keep on planning to keep

520
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:31,070
updating and I think it is a service yes

521
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,750
no we hadn't thought of that I mean

522
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,549
maybe since a meal is involved or

523
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:38,200
something you could because it's very

524
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:38,200
useful when you want to select probes

525
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,630
Robert

526
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:59,990
you want me to say yes yes no it's these

527
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,090
are these are typically thing that that

528
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,190
we love seeing I mean sort of speaking

529
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:07,908
for the Atlas Operations team or

530
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:09,950
development whatever that these are the

531
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:11,330
things that we ourselves were thinking

532
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,620
about some of them but we didn't do

533
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,299
because it's a lot of work and we are

534
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,530
not research well most of our us are not

535
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:17,809
researchers so you know there's good

536
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,908
stuff to be done here but once there is

537
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:22,100
kind of some kind of consensus that this

538
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:24,679
is a good algorithm if all you've only

539
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,500
if Atlas ran it inside and gave us the

540
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:30,770
diet data naturally that would be great

541
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,840
than sure we can do those things so we

542
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,760
even have a contributor taking off site

543
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,240
research and I'm putting on my operator

544
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,250
hat

545
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,890
since you seem to like to think

546
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:44,780
operators your major customer and I am

547
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:50,840
one um is as an operator when I want to

548
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:54,080
look at how the internet sees my data

549
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:57,649
sees my AAS sees my whatever I want

550
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,870
diversity and having this as diversity I

551
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,610
want so it's not just the researchers

552
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:07,250
who would like this so as I said I'm

553
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,689
yeah I'm happy to pick it up and you

554
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,210
know make this a part of your service

555
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,309
that's no problem the the issue that I

556
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,980
have not in particularly with this is

557
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:17,450
that there are like dozens of these kind

558
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,429
of things that people want to throw at

559
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,480
the Atlas team to say do this do this do

560
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:22,429
this do this building building building

561
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,340
building and we have to like look at

562
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:28,720
which ones are I don't know more useful

563
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:31,129
or more interesting or whatever they are

564
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,140
as you had at the mic right now can you

565
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,460
tell something about the selection

566
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:39,710
algorithm you're using right now sure

567
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,600
that's basically what you can say is

568
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,160
that give me probes from this country

569
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,428
they say as this prefix this and that

570
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,410
but if you say give me 50 from this a s

571
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:49,300
then the system basically does two

572
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,590
things

573
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,659
randomized is somewhat so it just says

574
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:56,209
well I'm gonna look at these 50 probes

575
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:59,809
for you but the one more interesting

576
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:04,190
thing that most of the people just

577
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:06,200
ignore or cleanse over when they do such

578
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:08,030
a thing is that we also have to take

579
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,730
into account how busy those probes are

580
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,740
so it's nice that you see a probe in

581
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:14,929
Antarctica and I oh I want to measure

582
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:18,530
from Antarctica but everyone else wants

583
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:20,660
to do that as well so we actually almost

584
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,950
physically had one in Antarctica but one

585
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,990
of the reasons why we didn't do that is

586
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,610
that it would be just useless for

587
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,500
everyone it would be nice maybe

588
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,330
basically no one could use it because

589
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,220
everyone would want to use it

590
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:34,250
so so I remember a couple of days ago

591
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,630
there was a hackathon where some of the

592
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,390
participants made a much better

593
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:40,640
algorithm of visually distributing the

594
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,340
probe on the globe so they compared look

595
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,710
when Atlas picks this is what you get

596
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,439
when my algorithm fix were all over the

597
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,880
place that was nice except that in

598
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,560
reality you cannot

599
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,330
so we need to expand the network to make

600
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,310
that available to everyone but coming

601
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,530
back to this thing sure um we can do

602
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:03,320
this we can build in such a thing and

603
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:10,129
say use the Randy algorithm to give me

604
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:14,090
probes that would be more magenta you're

605
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:17,000
so humble but I do have a question

606
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:20,300
though since I'm sending here so how

607
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,920
would this scale if we had a hundred

608
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,570
thousand probes a million probes you

609
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:29,300
know pairwise comparisons N squared

610
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:30,159
that's kind of difficult your long way

611
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:37,149
to go

612
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:38,750
this runs pretty quick and it's

613
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:43,130
decomposable if you want to use

614
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:44,480
parallelism I have a last question of

615
00:31:43,130 --> 00:32:07,190
course I was really disappointed that

616
00:31:44,480 --> 00:32:08,570
you only looked at ipv4 maybe with your

617
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,250
experience you have a guess if you

618
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,830
expect that the routes are different for

619
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:18,860
ipv6 or probably kind of similar well as

620
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:25,730
we know ipv6 routing is different than

621
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:29,899
ipv4 routing and I think Jeff Houston

622
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:33,710
said it best the decade ago is when

623
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:36,490
there's enough money behind ipv6 the

624
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:39,530
ipv6 routing will get straightened out

625
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:42,440
there's been a lot of interesting work

626
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:47,180
on looking at the difference between the

627
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:50,120
two you could clearly trivially run this

628
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:54,530
over v6 versus before and if you're

629
00:32:50,120 --> 00:33:00,469
looking for these v6 probes to use this

630
00:32:54,530 --> 00:33:02,629
is trivial oh we didn't do it that's a

631
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,280
common failure

632
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,290
I realize when I give her a hard time

633
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,920
about v6 those people that don't want to

634
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:17,300
know me cuz I'm first ISP to deploy I

635
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:22,400
give you 6 the world 1997 so um it's

636
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:24,110
trivial to make it to v6 ok so I have

637
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,010
one question before I get out of here

638
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:36,040
which is is there a DNS behavior

639
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:38,420
researcher in the room you're only fit

640
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:42,310
catch me at the break would you because

641
00:33:38,420 --> 00:34:38,149
in the NOC we see something really cute

642
00:33:42,310 --> 00:34:40,750
thank you very much so the next work is

643
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:40,750
not up yet

644
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:49,010
the next talk is given by a Petrus

645
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:52,189
teaches he is also looking at ripe tater

646
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:56,869
and he's using looking at user to user

647
00:34:52,190 --> 00:35:03,320
connectivity and now I forgot your host

648
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:08,420
CPU master student okay and you're

649
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:11,780
currently at a tripe okay you're already

650
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,599
gone okay okay so I just leave you to

651
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:42,349
your presentation

652
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:45,950
do you need help so good morning

653
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:48,490
everyone my name is Patrice giggy's and

654
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:53,080
today I will present the paper

655
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:53,080
characterizing user to user connectivity

656
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,750
[Music]

657
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,030
[Music]

658
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,740
okay now you can hear me right so use it

659
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:41,000
to use their connectivity using dry

660
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:42,950
pathless this is a joint work with so we

661
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,560
said joint work with Vasily Scott Ronnie

662
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:53,299
Steven okay Amy lab and so hand informed

663
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,430
us and for this work we had to develop

664
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,960
two different tools the tools are

665
00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:02,509
already available as a

666
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:05,000
types and we use ripe Atlas for the

667
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:25,369
measurements but first of all let's look

668
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:27,290
a deployment around the globe so we can

669
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:29,990
see that there are ripe Atlas probes

670
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:32,900
almost everywhere with Africa being an

671
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:35,990
outlier and this probes are deployed in

672
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:39,170
hundreds of networks but we don't have

673
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:41,868
any kind of estimates or estimates of a

674
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:47,450
huge that are being covered using this

675
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:51,380
probes so in this work we focus on

676
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:54,890
eyeball networks and when we say eyeball

677
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:58,640
networks we felt the networks that have

678
00:37:54,890 --> 00:38:01,400
a largest users population that contains

679
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,540
a la decisión population in any given

680
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:09,589
country so as an example an ISP is an

681
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:11,330
eyeball network and studying the eyeball

682
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:14,390
networks is very important and

683
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:17,509
interesting because it's a user to user

684
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:21,279
traffic and it's important for real-time

685
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:28,339
communication like online game VoIP and

686
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:31,820
a this depends on how these networks are

687
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:34,040
interconnected it's ever so there are

688
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:37,369
many interesting properties but we can

689
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:40,599
study and in this work we study the

690
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:44,180
traffic locality so we tried to see if

691
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:47,030
traffic between two eyeballs networks in

692
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:50,560
a country stays inside the country and

693
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:55,480
either eyeball networks are direct are

694
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:58,700
direct or indirect either connected and

695
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:02,420
this is important for free main reasons

696
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:06,680
the first one is for security reasons so

697
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:08,900
we if you have an able network connect

698
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,640
direct with another eyeball network you

699
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:13,910
minimize I've stroking

700
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,749
you also maybe have less latency and

701
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:22,730
it's easier for a network administrator

702
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:26,450
to debug and the main questions that we

703
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:28,910
address in this work is to see if ripe

704
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:31,519
Atlas is deployed in the network the

705
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:34,009
lightest user population in every

706
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:40,129
country and also study how these

707
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:41,839
networks are disconnected server and we

708
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,119
had also to think which are very

709
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:48,200
interesting properties we should study

710
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:50,989
and measure and visualize but also we

711
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,629
wanted to see if there this properties

712
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:58,009
differ from country to country and there

713
00:39:53,630 --> 00:40:00,230
are patterns between countries so we had

714
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:08,230
to create two tools as I said in the

715
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:11,239
beginning and using this tool we try to

716
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:14,239
answer to this question to find the most

717
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:18,079
suitable way to visualize with

718
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:21,970
statistics and measurements and for the

719
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:26,509
first tool we used VAP Nick estimates

720
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:29,709
ethnics provide user population

721
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:33,289
estimates per ASN per any given country

722
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:36,739
so we selected the eyeball networks

723
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:39,200
using two different thresholds the first

724
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:42,319
one we assume that an eyeball network is

725
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,480
a network that has at least one percent

726
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:47,839
of the users population in that country

727
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:51,259
and we also select one more threshold

728
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:55,519
the cumulative 95 percent that for

729
00:40:51,259 --> 00:41:01,009
population covered in the country later

730
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:04,669
we use the ripe Atlas API to fetch

731
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:09,140
probes for these networks and we also

732
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:12,680
convert our estimate of covert using

733
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:15,640
statistics from internet life starts so

734
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:19,609
we have at least one ripe Atlas probe

735
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,990
active in the nibel network we assume

736
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:29,520
but the network is covered

737
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:32,069
on average we have 90.5% covered in any

738
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,380
given County however there are some

739
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:40,800
outliers like Rocio and we wanted to

740
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:45,200
make this more clear so we visualize our

741
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:51,329
findings and here is a global innovators

742
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:58,879
of the ripe Atlas covered we look on

743
00:41:51,329 --> 00:42:01,589
ipv4 probes which are public so we use a

744
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:06,540
range of colors with the white are the

745
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:09,690
countries with Nora on a eyeball covered

746
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:15,990
and with dark green are the counties

747
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:21,059
with 100% I part less covers so we can

748
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:23,848
see that Africa is again an outlier but

749
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:26,880
also we wanted to provide a more useful

750
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:29,339
insight for noted network operators and

751
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,730
ripe Atlas ambassadors so we create a

752
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:34,920
more detailed view actually the tool is

753
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:39,140
already available on the link of the

754
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:43,200
bottom so it's SD does Bob a striped

755
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:48,509
dotnet and Petros loss a population

756
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:51,000
covered so this is a table but create on

757
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:53,460
a daily base using the zones that

758
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,319
describe I described before so this is

759
00:42:53,460 --> 00:43:01,619
snapshot of 12 of July and we can see

760
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:06,089
but for velar just eyeballed network in

761
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:08,190
chess republic we fail to mark it as a

762
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:10,770
cupboard because we have only one

763
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:14,099
private probe but having one private

764
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:15,809
probe it's not useful but in public for

765
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:19,619
probes to measure with nato

766
00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:22,829
so if you deploy one probe its network

767
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:27,180
we increase the percentage covers inches

768
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:29,240
public forum from almost 50 percent to 8

769
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,240
percent

770
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:40,160
and sin okay and next we'll create it

771
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:44,190
one more tool we call it I will die and

772
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:48,029
the main concept of a tool is to use act

773
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:51,090
measurements so we use ripe Atlas probes

774
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:55,680
from rival tribe and we do trace out

775
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:59,730
from my ball tribe or networks and we

776
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:03,509
look on the properties like if it rains

777
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:06,030
not past stays inside the country and if

778
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:12,960
we trace out past reverse other races if

779
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:16,530
yes which ones how many of them and let

780
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,710
me give you some more tales about the

781
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:24,600
elimination so we do monkey traceroute

782
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:27,060
from my ball to eyeball networks and for

783
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:32,069
the probe selection right now we use a

784
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:34,410
very simply methodology we select the

785
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:39,390
closest and the fairest probe from the

786
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:47,100
country's capital to try to expose the

787
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:51,810
AAAS diversity and we use right start to

788
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:56,850
map eyepiece to a aces we support ipv4

789
00:44:51,810 --> 00:45:03,930
and ipv6 and to delegate the traceroute

790
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:09,089
pass we use open IP map in order to as I

791
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:12,020
said before to visualize the statistics

792
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:15,690
in the findings we had to come up with a

793
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:19,380
visualization so we created the a s to s

794
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:23,430
matrix the s to s matrix is a stable

795
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:26,640
structure it's row represent an ipod

796
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:28,710
network as a source and it's column

797
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,400
represents an eyeball network as a

798
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:36,360
destination the size of a cells depends

799
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,490
on the APNIC estimate estimate and the

800
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,530
color of the cells represents

801
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:43,740
interesting properties like if the

802
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:46,319
traceroute path goes out of County

803
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:50,098
in country we have ripe Atlas covered

804
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:54,240
are there any inconsistencies between

805
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:57,510
probes I forgot to mention that we

806
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:01,200
select two probes arrival networks so we

807
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:03,900
have two against two our probes in the

808
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:08,089
destination IP networks so may we may

809
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:14,339
see different trace a trace out path and

810
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:17,069
we use a basic metric so we select as an

811
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:21,270
example the green boxes and we divided

812
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:25,980
with a whole area of a space matrix to

813
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:29,130
find the basic metric presented and next

814
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:32,970
is an example of a eyeball to die for

815
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:40,319
Canada this is a snapshot of first of

816
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:45,540
April so we can see that almost 47% of

817
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:50,759
the tracer pass stays inside the country

818
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:54,349
and only 3.1 percent is going out of

819
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:59,549
country we have some inconsistencies and

820
00:46:54,349 --> 00:47:02,010
we like to measure small networks we

821
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:06,839
also investigate the direct and indirect

822
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:08,670
path and we use the border to

823
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:12,078
distinguish that with direct and

824
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:17,480
indirect paths so with white borders

825
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:20,609
it's a direct eyeball-to-eyeball

826
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:24,750
interconnection so for Canada we found

827
00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:26,578
out what almost 41 percent or trade-offs

828
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:31,650
between eyeball-to-eyeball networks what

829
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:34,619
we measure is direct path and next as we

830
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:36,450
are in chassis public didn't resist and

831
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:40,319
it's a step up

832
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:43,259
so as I said with previously we like to

833
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:48,390
cover the biggest eyeball Network so

834
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:53,030
that's why you see the a white boxes and

835
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:55,740
we also see here but almost 10% of a

836
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,410
tracer path between eyeball networks

837
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:01,009
they go out of count

838
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:07,109
we like to cover 32%

839
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:14,210
we'd not measure 46% and the direct path

840
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:18,120
our 17% we also measure Australia and

841
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:20,580
Vistal measures right now 104 countries

842
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:24,630
and it's available the link on the

843
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:27,319
bottom of slide and as you can see in

844
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:30,600
Australia between eyeball-to-eyeball

845
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:34,640
interconnections we see that every trace

846
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:40,049
help us stays inside the continent and

847
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:46,620
indirect and direct paths are 25 percent

848
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:50,490
and 29 percent respectively in this work

849
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:55,500
we have some limitations so first of all

850
00:48:50,490 --> 00:49:00,120
ripe Atlas provides a biased view of the

851
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:05,370
encounter connectivity we measure this

852
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:08,370
out path and no traffic volume we don't

853
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:12,180
have ground truth about the IP level and

854
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:15,480
the location accuracy and we also face

855
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:18,899
the same difficulties we with other

856
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,510
works like I between mappings and we

857
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:26,340
plan in the future to use tools like map

858
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:29,040
it to improve timber god we also measure

859
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:33,690
on layer 3 we don't have any layer 2

860
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:39,509
visibility and we are looking for ground

861
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:44,400
truth influence for our testing fire for

862
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:54,330
replicas mate and also for the way that

863
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:58,470
we define the Inka so as a future work

864
00:49:54,330 --> 00:50:01,080
we plan to move from prototype of this

865
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:02,609
tool to fully fledged tools and make

866
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,100
them publicly available to the community

867
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:08,790
to the network operators and also to

868
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,959
very services and we on we want also to

869
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:13,869
gain visibility on

870
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:16,359
I will to neighbor our neighbor count

871
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:19,569
the eyeball traffic so as an example we

872
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:22,598
want to measure the eyeball networks of

873
00:50:19,569 --> 00:50:27,719
Netherlands against eyeball networks of

874
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:32,169
Germany and we also want to measure a

875
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:34,659
rival to popular CD ends we are also

876
00:50:32,169 --> 00:50:39,999
looking on more sophisticated probe

877
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:45,009
grouping selections and we look for

878
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:47,558
collaboration in on this we need also to

879
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:51,400
validate our infinince about IP to a is

880
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:55,119
mapping with the location and as I said

881
00:50:51,400 --> 00:51:02,769
before we want with the great tools like

882
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:05,619
map it on our methodology so for

883
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:08,669
completion we estimate the ripe Atlas

884
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:12,989
covered in eyeball networks and we

885
00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:17,259
present a prototype of the Eiffel to die

886
00:51:12,989 --> 00:51:19,659
the main aim of the tool is to measure

887
00:51:17,259 --> 00:51:22,959
and visualize aspects of user to user

888
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:25,390
connectivity boundary and the tool is

889
00:51:22,959 --> 00:51:27,459
developed to help users and operator to

890
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:30,219
discover in the Scimitar connectivity

891
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:34,288
artifacts in the cartridge they need or

892
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:40,179
we operate the tool is available again

893
00:51:34,289 --> 00:51:41,890
not linked and our work is based to

894
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:42,309
probe the probe measurements using ripe

895
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,339
Atlas

896
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:50,640
we use the ethnic estimate and we are

897
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:55,538
very for evening provides such kind of

898
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:59,169
statistics and to use I a PTAs mapping

899
00:51:55,539 --> 00:52:06,119
from right path I start and the

900
00:51:59,169 --> 00:52:09,939
delegation using open IP map so you can

901
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:12,400
tools as I said they are available so if

902
00:52:09,939 --> 00:52:14,288
you have any questions thank you very

903
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,659
much

904
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:19,209
I have two quick clarification questions

905
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:21,390
so one is which kind of tracer did you

906
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:21,390
use

907
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:29,210
we use part stays out so TCP tracery

908
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:31,730
okay and the other one is you have this

909
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:33,170
inconsistency number so that's when you

910
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:37,550
do two measurements and they show

911
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:40,370
different research okay there were some

912
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:42,530
times that we see that it raised out you

913
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:47,630
a probe use a different upstream

914
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:52,240
provider to reach the same network so it

915
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:55,940
may depends on the example grease

916
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:59,959
because I know the ecosystem grease for

917
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:02,450
a network we divide the network into

918
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,610
parts north in the south so they use two

919
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:07,520
different upstream providers even to

920
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:17,270
reach another network so that's why we

921
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:20,060
see instances out why does this does

922
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:20,420
this work if you bite into it then it

923
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:23,570
works

924
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:25,010
and I had a question you hit for for

925
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:27,920
your definition of an eyeball network

926
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:29,900
yet this magic number of 1% of the you

927
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,840
of the users of a country where where

928
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,610
does this number come from is this

929
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:37,540
intuitively it feels too small to be

930
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:40,400
representative actually we want to study

931
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:43,880
in fine granularity and we wanted to

932
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:50,570
make a visualization but easy but it's

933
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:53,960
easy for Samuel to to view it so if we

934
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:56,870
lower the threshold we will end up to

935
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:02,000
something like the X become the die we

936
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:03,920
will have hundreds of networks so so in

937
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:15,110
other words 1% is already a pretty large

938
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:17,090
number it's no I wouldn't know so so I

939
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:18,410
would have said if the network is

940
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:22,220
representative for a country if it

941
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:23,629
covers 10% of the users or 15% not just

942
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,839
one person this is what I'm wondering

943
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:28,430
about so that actually goes in line with

944
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,590
my previous question because if you saw

945
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:31,910
this in consistencies because some of

946
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:34,550
the network providers split up the

947
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:36,109
network then you just randomly saw it

948
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:37,580
some at some point in another

949
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:39,710
you might not have selected any notes

950
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:42,290
that would have shown the same behavior

951
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:45,290
so maybe you need to measure more probes

952
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:47,450
within a network to get a better view

953
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:59,870
it's also kind of what you're seeing

954
00:54:47,450 --> 00:55:02,270
right yeah so I have a met a question

955
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:06,470
I'm wondering why you started by

956
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:09,050
focusing on end user to end user traffic

957
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,520
patterns now I you know I work for a CDN

958
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,990
so maybe I have a distorted view of the

959
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,030
world but it seems to me that most

960
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:16,250
people's interactions with the internet

961
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:18,080
involve a third party a service provider

962
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,490
of some sort whether it's email or

963
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:23,810
they're collected or a website or

964
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:26,720
something so why is user to user direct

965
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:28,850
connectivity interesting actually there

966
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:33,799
are many application but they use user

967
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:42,350
to user connectivity a couple of

968
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:44,120
examples like direct end-to-end VoIP is

969
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:53,900
that that's it

970
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:56,450
I'm our unit Magnus but yes you have to

971
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:58,490
describe view of the way all right so I

972
00:55:56,450 --> 00:56:01,549
write so I tried to preface my remarks

973
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:03,109
but just seems to me that there's a why

974
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:04,460
I start there I guess that's the

975
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:06,230
question I'm not saying that there isn't

976
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:10,850
that traffic but what makes that

977
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:13,520
interesting and this is a first step so

978
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:18,670
we plan to measure against Citians but

979
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:22,120
measuring towards CD ends is a lot of

980
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,120
more complex

981
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:32,569
um this is actually oh wow okay hello um

982
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:35,149
this is actually more of a comment than

983
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:36,560
a question because you pointed out that

984
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:40,160
you're looking like future workers

985
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:42,410
integrating border map and/or map it I'm

986
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,690
wondering how much of your inconsistency

987
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:47,390
actually comes from inaccurate AAS

988
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:49,940
boundary inference because a s boundary

989
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:51,589
inference is a is a quality like if you

990
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,780
look at that the the prior work and map

991
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:55,880
it right s boundary which is a really

992
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:59,780
hard problem and doing the dumb thing

993
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:01,130
ends up having um you get like wildly

994
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,020
inaccurate estimates for certain

995
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:05,060
topologies so when you see an

996
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:07,160
inconsistency some of that could be

997
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:08,690
either zone crowding or different

998
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,640
routing policies where you know you're

999
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:15,050
as Randy pointed out you're making the

1000
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:17,060
the common it's the common fallacy of an

1001
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:20,090
a s is actually an internally coherent

1002
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:22,040
thing but I think that some of it could

1003
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:23,630
be your your border inference or am I

1004
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,920
missing where that in coherency is

1005
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:29,030
coming or that where that inconsistency

1006
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:31,550
is coming from maybe be the border you

1007
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:35,570
say it but those it can be wrong

1008
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:39,080
location so okay yeah right which is

1009
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:43,540
also for ripe Atlas probes is is best

1010
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,540
effort faith right so okay cool thanks

1011
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:50,120
and I'm having kind of the same last

1012
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:58,790
question again did you look into ipv6

1013
00:57:50,120 --> 00:58:02,029
yes yes we look but currently we have on

1014
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:06,230
the online tool only I feel for but soon

1015
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:09,500
we will be there and we plan to make it

1016
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:20,570
like a fully fledged tool okay thank you

1017
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:22,810
very much are you bringing your own

1018
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,810
depth

1019
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:56,200
so okay so the next torque or the next

1020
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:58,029
paper is a full paper and it's from a

1021
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,819
mesh and he can unfortunately not be

1022
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:04,599
here I guess that's the one Trevor grant

1023
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:14,400
that didn't work out maybe yuck that's a

1024
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:14,400
student okay um so um no okay

1025
00:59:14,589 --> 00:59:20,770
so he couldn't come he's at sisk rice in

1026
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:23,020
Sweden and now Anna bernstrom is

1027
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:26,259
presenting instead she's a professor at

1028
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:28,030
Cal State University and here have been

1029
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:29,200
kind of working with them together and

1030
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:35,050
doing some measurements right here

1031
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:37,359
basically involved in this I can answer

1032
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:39,460
that questions I guess so yes so Ian

1033
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:42,369
could unfortunately not be here he is in

1034
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:45,310
Australia for family reasons so he sent

1035
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:48,310
his apologies and I would try to

1036
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:50,950
introduce his work on cheese pie which

1037
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:52,839
is a lightweight measurement platforms

1038
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:55,899
which uses raspberry pies as the

1039
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:58,089
measurement notes so this is a platform

1040
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:01,300
that Ian has been working on for the

1041
00:59:58,089 --> 01:00:03,099
last three years or so and this paper

1042
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:06,609
she's PI research results and the

1043
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:09,760
regulator kind of gives some background

1044
01:00:06,609 --> 01:00:11,290
on this work and summarizes a bit the

1045
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,430
different measurements that have been

1046
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:17,680
done and what it's looking forward to do

1047
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:19,240
so if you've looked at the paper you've

1048
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,169
seen that it covers a number of

1049
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:25,899
different aspects and this work has been

1050
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:28,420
done in the context of ready which is a

1051
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:30,040
national project in Sweden with the

1052
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,650
research environment for advancing low

1053
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:34,480
latency internet and coast university is

1054
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:37,180
a partner in that project so in that

1055
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,920
sense I have heard about sheets by a

1056
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:41,529
number of times we have

1057
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:44,140
one of the nodes located in cold stuff

1058
01:00:41,529 --> 01:00:46,480
but I have not been directly involved in

1059
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:51,700
this work or in the measurements in the

1060
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:54,880
paper so this is all I work so I will do

1061
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:56,169
my best to try and and and also one

1062
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,059
interesting thing to mention is maybe

1063
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:00,369
that this was first presented at the

1064
01:00:58,059 --> 01:01:03,760
rain workshop two years ago also

1065
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:05,019
co-located with the IETF and now we're

1066
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,480
happy to actually see some results here

1067
01:01:05,019 --> 01:01:09,308
yes so if you were a dream then the IANA

1068
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:18,099
introduced the platform there and talked

1069
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:21,220
a little bit about so ian has sent me

1070
01:01:18,099 --> 01:01:25,180
the slides and it has three parts so

1071
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:26,769
first some general aspects about the

1072
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:28,899
measurement background for the platform

1073
01:01:26,769 --> 01:01:33,279
and the context in which it has been

1074
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:36,099
developed than some examples of the

1075
01:01:33,279 --> 01:01:37,539
measurements that have been done up to

1076
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:39,880
now and the types of measurements that

1077
01:01:37,539 --> 01:01:45,400
you can use the platform for and then

1078
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:48,700
some future directions so she spy

1079
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:52,150
targets home networks so the idea is to

1080
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:54,578
try and capture the the Internet

1081
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:56,829
performance as you see as a home user so

1082
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:58,619
you would put one of these cheese pie

1083
01:01:56,829 --> 01:02:00,910
devices in the home and measure

1084
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:03,940
performance from there so the greater

1085
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:05,859
context is kind of that you see internet

1086
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,599
at home as the utility and then of

1087
01:02:05,859 --> 01:02:11,740
course we need to have an ability to

1088
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:14,230
monitor and follow up on this measuring

1089
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:17,470
from the home vantage point is also

1090
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:19,869
something that is typically not so easy

1091
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:22,569
from the external tools that the ice

1092
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:25,210
piece may use to monitor network so it's

1093
01:02:22,569 --> 01:02:29,470
in that sense complimentary to that type

1094
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:31,480
of measurements so there are of course a

1095
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:34,058
lot of different measurement platforms

1096
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:38,319
and measurement work out there so as I

1097
01:02:34,059 --> 01:02:40,539
said he's my torus measurement from the

1098
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:42,609
home network so in that sense it's has

1099
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:44,470
similar goals as other tools that I will

1100
01:02:42,609 --> 01:02:47,859
also looked at home networking such as

1101
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:50,919
phantom and that Lizer host view already

1102
01:02:47,859 --> 01:02:52,450
from the beginning ian has been in

1103
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,339
context with the the reg

1104
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:57,759
laterz in Sweden's post and theaters

1105
01:02:54,339 --> 01:02:59,440
tears and the pts so it's also an

1106
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,980
intention here that the monitoring

1107
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:05,920
should be useful from Allegra regulatory

1108
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:09,790
perspective and I am is working together

1109
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:15,609
with PDS to try and develop the platform

1110
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:17,410
in that way the need for using the

1111
01:03:15,609 --> 01:03:20,230
measurements that we do as researchers

1112
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:22,779
as a measurement community also for

1113
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:25,089
regulations and influencing policy was

1114
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:28,390
something that was discussed those at

1115
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:30,009
Ames workshop earlier this year and of

1116
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:33,098
course the different regulators are also

1117
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:36,130
doing efforts in this area so in Europe

1118
01:03:33,099 --> 01:03:38,170
we have a barek the board for the

1119
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:42,849
European regulators that have looked at

1120
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:44,650
how you can follow up on the directives

1121
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:48,010
for for open Internet that we have in

1122
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:51,010
Europe in the US you have FCC which has

1123
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:52,839
a broadband America measurement

1124
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:56,020
campaigns to try and follow up on on

1125
01:03:52,839 --> 01:03:58,750
Internet performance so this this work

1126
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:02,410
with pts kind of ties into these these

1127
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:04,359
aspects and the regulatory view is also

1128
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:07,118
something that has been discussed in

1129
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:08,710
IETF in the IEEE ppm a measurement group

1130
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,400
I think there was a draft discussed in

1131
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:14,609
Chicago that related to this from the

1132
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:19,569
net neutrality and regulators

1133
01:04:14,609 --> 01:04:21,640
perspective so she spy will they solve

1134
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:24,130
all these problems of course not it's

1135
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,839
just in a one attempt here another

1136
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:28,930
measurement platform to make some

1137
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:33,339
contribution in this space and the way

1138
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:35,200
the platform is set up is that you write

1139
01:04:33,339 --> 01:04:38,890
your your tasks your measurements or

1140
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:42,098
typically this put together in Python

1141
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:44,078
and then the platform has mechanisms so

1142
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:46,990
that the results get collected in the

1143
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:50,140
database on the PI nodes as synchronized

1144
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:52,060
to a central database it collects all

1145
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,859
the measurements there is a scheduling

1146
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:55,599
system so that you can indicate the

1147
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:59,049
schedule for when your test should be

1148
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:00,790
run and there is also a dashboard for

1149
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:03,880
the tests that are available which he

1150
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:06,009
spies they're like 15 measurement tasks

1151
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:11,109
defines that you can as a user

1152
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:13,390
see the the impact of viewer the quality

1153
01:05:11,109 --> 01:05:16,060
of your connection and results of the

1154
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:20,080
measurements there is a further slide on

1155
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:22,390
this later on here and of course now Ian

1156
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:24,580
is looking into also how to design the

1157
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:27,220
specific tests that the regulator's

1158
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:28,569
would be looking at here and of course

1159
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:30,580
then we are talking about things like

1160
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:32,619
are you doing traffic traffic

1161
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:34,210
differentiation in the networks or the

1162
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:35,920
flow prioritizations to be treat

1163
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:38,020
different applications in different ways

1164
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,630
and so on so the things of things that

1165
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:42,700
you would need to follow up on on the

1166
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:46,359
regulatory a premier editorial

1167
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:48,430
perspective when you do measurements you

1168
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,240
can have different approaches you may do

1169
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:52,379
the crowdsource

1170
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:54,279
approach where you have a lot of

1171
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:56,020
volunteers that download your software

1172
01:05:54,280 --> 01:06:00,609
and you get a lot of measurements and

1173
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:03,040
from that you derive your statistics and

1174
01:06:00,609 --> 01:06:05,049
your your view of the network so this is

1175
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:08,710
not the goal of cheese pie so the idea

1176
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:10,859
here is rather to try and very carefully

1177
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:13,180
select your measurement points so that

1178
01:06:10,859 --> 01:06:15,160
with the minimum of nodes you can

1179
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:17,020
collect the information that you would

1180
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,640
need to kind of get the view of the

1181
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:22,090
network and follow-up from the

1182
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:24,580
regulatory perspectives and having a

1183
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:26,380
long lasting measurements and there's

1184
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:29,560
also being the Enna's also focused quite

1185
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:31,390
a bit on specific events on pc times

1186
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:34,060
when you have some popular things that

1187
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:36,160
the regular user would like to take part

1188
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:39,640
in or to view and see how the network

1189
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,839
works under those conditions and of

1190
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,720
course if we're now going to put this

1191
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:46,380
platform in the home users and run it

1192
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:51,490
from there it's essential that it's

1193
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:53,550
trivial to install and configure so from

1194
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:56,859
the regulatory perspective you need to

1195
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:59,410
follow up on different directives which

1196
01:06:56,859 --> 01:07:01,630
are often quite vague maybe in the way

1197
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:04,480
they are specified so you need to be

1198
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:08,050
able to define how to actually do the

1199
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:11,020
follow up on this and to then also have

1200
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:13,480
some method to see that the ISPs or

1201
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:17,500
other actors if they are not following

1202
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:19,690
this so in sweden at the moment but pts

1203
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,240
does is basically uses surveys

1204
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:25,630
it sends out surveys to a number of

1205
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:27,609
users to see how the quality of the

1206
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:30,940
network connections are it also sends

1207
01:07:27,609 --> 01:07:33,700
out surveys to the operators to have

1208
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:35,950
them report on if they do what type of

1209
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:38,439
traffic differentiation they may use and

1210
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:40,990
what special services they have so the

1211
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:43,270
idea here is to the goal here together

1212
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:45,279
with pts is to also support this with

1213
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:48,220
measurement information where you can

1214
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:50,589
actually detect some of these things and

1215
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:53,169
see if if what you get into in your

1216
01:07:50,589 --> 01:07:56,950
surveys is also what the users actually

1217
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:59,290
see in the network so if you're now

1218
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:02,200
going to measure from the perspective of

1219
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:04,869
a regulator and use this maybe to him

1220
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:08,319
enforce policy then the fairness of the

1221
01:08:04,869 --> 01:08:10,690
measurements is one key issue that Ian

1222
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:12,640
is currently thinking about and that I

1223
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:15,099
think we'll also need more thought here

1224
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,809
it's not that there are some a lot of

1225
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:18,339
this is still work-in-progress even

1226
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:21,400
though it's been ongoing for a while

1227
01:08:18,339 --> 01:08:23,198
so when we as researchers do

1228
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:24,580
measurements we are a bit opportunistic

1229
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,889
and we look for some particular

1230
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:29,830
particular aspect and we we may measure

1231
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:31,960
and if we catch that this is maybe

1232
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:33,850
serving our purpose but if you're going

1233
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,710
to use it more from the regulatory

1234
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:37,680
perspective you have to be fair to all

1235
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:40,870
the different operators and see that you

1236
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:43,029
capture a correct use so how do you do

1237
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:45,910
fair measurements this I think is an

1238
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:48,430
open issue do you need to measure the

1239
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:50,290
same number of traffic per operator do

1240
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:52,210
you scale it depending on the size of

1241
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:54,339
the operators do you need to have the

1242
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:56,049
exact time same time when you do the

1243
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:59,410
measurements and so on and what will be

1244
01:08:56,049 --> 01:09:03,549
accepted by the different actors in the

1245
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:05,318
a that are involved in this issue so

1246
01:09:03,549 --> 01:09:07,000
this is also something that in Sweden

1247
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:09,850
there are ongoing discussions right now

1248
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,910
between the different actors involved in

1249
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:15,489
this space on how to define measurements

1250
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:18,399
that all can agree on actually or

1251
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:21,879
representative and can be used to

1252
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:23,559
measure internet quality okay so this

1253
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:26,549
was a bit of the background and the

1254
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:30,850
general scope that she's my has been

1255
01:09:26,549 --> 01:09:32,839
developed in so now some examples of the

1256
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:35,659
type of measurements that ian has done

1257
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:38,330
the past so the platform has so far of

1258
01:09:35,658 --> 01:09:40,278
course also been used mainly for the

1259
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:42,170
research purpose so far so there are

1260
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:43,880
three types of measurements that you

1261
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:45,710
could do in the platform the first of

1262
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,989
course is that you can take your sheets

1263
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:50,448
by node and then you can measure to some

1264
01:09:47,988 --> 01:09:52,669
service at the internet and what Ian has

1265
01:09:50,448 --> 01:09:56,360
mainly been looking at in that context

1266
01:09:52,670 --> 01:10:00,340
is - video delivery and in particularly

1267
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:03,110
he is trying to look at strolling events

1268
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:05,630
we all know that video download is a

1269
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:07,969
complex aspects you have a lot of

1270
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:09,320
interactions between different aspects

1271
01:10:07,969 --> 01:10:11,179
between the different algorithms

1272
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:13,880
involved between the networking effects

1273
01:10:11,179 --> 01:10:16,520
so he's been doing capturing

1274
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:19,460
measurements here to try and identify

1275
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:21,139
which one of these things that you can

1276
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,920
measure in the network's actually has an

1277
01:10:21,139 --> 01:10:26,389
impact on the stalling of the video and

1278
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,219
applying various statistical techniques

1279
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:31,190
to try and isolate the different

1280
01:10:28,219 --> 01:10:34,190
components and for this work is using

1281
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:37,190
some of the videos and sequences from

1282
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:40,280
the video quality expert group which has

1283
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:43,219
a pre rating offline so that you have a

1284
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:45,320
baseline for what the video should type

1285
01:10:43,219 --> 01:10:49,300
of rating the video should get if there

1286
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:51,739
are no impairments over over the network

1287
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:54,619
another type of measurements that Ian

1288
01:10:51,739 --> 01:10:57,290
has been doing is between different XI

1289
01:10:54,619 --> 01:11:00,469
spy nodes so then you have control of

1290
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:03,230
both the server and the client in the

1291
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:05,540
measurement and he has been doing for

1292
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:09,589
instance basic delay measurements so for

1293
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:12,469
that he uses TCP based measurements so

1294
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:14,869
measuring either in the handshake or the

1295
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:16,489
teardown of the corrections you can

1296
01:11:14,869 --> 01:11:19,219
measure between the scene and the sumac

1297
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:21,739
and this of course gives you a delay

1298
01:11:19,219 --> 01:11:23,929
measurement for the network and as you

1299
01:11:21,739 --> 01:11:26,150
have control you can also remove the the

1300
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:28,580
delays from the server processing or the

1301
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:30,500
client processing so this is an example

1302
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:31,940
graph from the paper illustrating some

1303
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,770
of the measurements from the platforms

1304
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:35,960
the blue here is basic thing

1305
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:37,550
measurements and then there's the delay

1306
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:40,159
measurements that are based rather on

1307
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:41,840
the on the TCP measurements and you have

1308
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:43,940
a degree in one when you have not

1309
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,580
removed the server processing delay and

1310
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:51,080
the red one when the server process

1311
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:53,900
thing delay is is removed and if he's

1312
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:56,330
trying to do this of course also not

1313
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:58,700
just once but over time to capture the

1314
01:11:56,330 --> 01:12:00,800
stability of the network and one of the

1315
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:02,690
future directions that he is also

1316
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,290
looking into is using this in four

1317
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:07,639
multipath and those doing multipath

1318
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:10,130
measurements overseas by where you can

1319
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:12,020
use this as as input for for path

1320
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:16,160
selection if you have this historic data

1321
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:17,900
here then the third type of measurement

1322
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:21,250
that Ian has been doing is using

1323
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:26,809
multiple she spies to monitor some

1324
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:29,300
events some key happenings in this case

1325
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:31,370
he has looked at the boxing matches that

1326
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,560
are very popular so a lot of users go

1327
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:35,960
online at the same time and then

1328
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,540
measuring over time so that you can see

1329
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,400
here is an example for one of the boxing

1330
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:42,170
games that they monitored so here is the

1331
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:45,320
time up to the match you can see that

1332
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:47,540
the delay in the network is quite stable

1333
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:51,200
and then what the closer you get to the

1334
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:53,150
event then you actually see that you

1335
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:57,800
have some impairments for some of the

1336
01:12:53,150 --> 01:13:01,099
the providers of this game and by trying

1337
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:02,630
to measure from multiple she's PI

1338
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,610
measurement points and also with

1339
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:06,440
multiple measurements he is trying to

1340
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:08,420
separate the different aspects that

1341
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:12,500
contributes to the delay here so we have

1342
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:15,260
both the basic ping measurements and

1343
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:18,170
then also the measurements at the HTTP

1344
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:20,420
level so to try and separate effects

1345
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:22,760
that comes from the server being

1346
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:25,190
overloaded from the effects that come

1347
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:27,350
from network being overloaded and this

1348
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:29,540
in general of course is not so so easy I

1349
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:31,460
mean yes you see the end effect but to

1350
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:34,340
also try and isolate what is actually

1351
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:36,140
the coercer of the difference so he's

1352
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:38,420
trying to then look at the combination

1353
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:44,780
of these make different measurements to

1354
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:47,330
isolate the different effects as I

1355
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:51,230
mentioned there is also a user interface

1356
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:54,680
available for this she's PI platform and

1357
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:57,709
it has some different levels so there is

1358
01:13:54,680 --> 01:14:00,500
a interface for the more tech savvy

1359
01:13:57,710 --> 01:14:02,510
users so I think it's very hard

1360
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:04,580
for you to see now you have this figure

1361
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:06,440
also in the paper but this one

1362
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:08,890
illustrates some of the outcomes of some

1363
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,879
of the tests that are defined in the

1364
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:14,420
platform's there is like a speed test

1365
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:18,500
like test there is a HTTP download one

1366
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:20,930
of the exercise there is some DNS lookup

1367
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:23,660
test I think and you also have some

1368
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:26,000
statistics on the cheese pie platform

1369
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:28,370
itself and the load on the measurement

1370
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,500
nodes so you can get some quite detailed

1371
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:34,790
statistics on the tests that are being

1372
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:36,650
run as this is intended to run in the

1373
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:39,910
home network and also be for the average

1374
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:45,070
user Jung has also worked on trying to

1375
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:49,220
have a more simple interface for the non

1376
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:52,250
non techie user so this is an attempt to

1377
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:54,140
illustrate how well your network is

1378
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:57,140
working so this is kind of your your

1379
01:14:54,140 --> 01:15:00,650
speed of data coming in and in order to

1380
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:03,170
meet different types of applications you

1381
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:05,120
would need different levels of water to

1382
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:08,540
be sustained here and if it's met and

1383
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:12,080
you have a happy duck in your bathtub so

1384
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:14,660
I'm not sure if this is easily

1385
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:22,790
interpreted by the end user but this is

1386
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:25,190
one of the so but this is one of them

1387
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:27,380
one of the aspects that ian is also

1388
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:31,030
working on in connection to the

1389
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:34,390
visualization and he has also done

1390
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:37,160
surveys to the end-users to see how they

1391
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:41,150
perceive various networks events and how

1392
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:43,040
they use their their internet services

1393
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:44,870
so trying to combine the measurements

1394
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:49,120
with the more traditional way of

1395
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:49,120
gathering information from the users

1396
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:53,960
okay so that wasn't an overview of the

1397
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:56,630
three types of measurements and some of

1398
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,250
the examples from the papers paper on

1399
01:15:56,630 --> 01:16:03,830
the different measurements that have

1400
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:06,640
been done looking forward he is working

1401
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:09,860
with the regulators to roll out

1402
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:13,070
additional PI's so as I said that target

1403
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:14,330
here is not to have a huge scale

1404
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:17,420
employment but

1405
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:18,890
enough notes to get some representative

1406
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:22,070
measurements I think at the moment the

1407
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:26,210
target is around 200 measurement points

1408
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:27,980
and to also then design these tests

1409
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:31,220
together with the regulator's that can

1410
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:34,820
help enlighten on the net neutrality

1411
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:37,790
porch as I said he's working on the

1412
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:41,690
video store quantification and trying to

1413
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:43,490
detect what metrics influence this and

1414
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:44,599
how you could actually make some

1415
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:47,360
predictions from your network

1416
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:51,640
measurements if you have video stalls at

1417
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:53,750
the user level he also want to use

1418
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,700
multiple vantage points from the

1419
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:57,500
different PI's to look at shared

1420
01:16:55,700 --> 01:17:01,870
infrastructure and congestion in the

1421
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:04,250
network and as I mentioned he is also

1422
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:07,240
initiating multipath experiments from

1423
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:08,960
the she spies using the MP TCP

1424
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,500
implementation and they are also

1425
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,510
connecting it to some of the more basic

1426
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:16,330
measurements that the platform already

1427
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:19,160
provides and that can give you some

1428
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:22,940
input for how to tune these these

1429
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:27,280
protocols thank you very much

1430
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:27,280
and your again has the first question

1431
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:35,900
first I think this has got to be the

1432
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,530
most awesome project name I've ever

1433
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,049
heard

1434
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:40,759
when you said to cheese pies the first

1435
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:45,410
thing I thought you can do that you have

1436
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:46,610
to second I did want to ask a little

1437
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:50,150
more serious note maybe you mentioned

1438
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:52,519
this but are you are you putting these

1439
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:55,580
notes on mobile networks at the far end

1440
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:58,490
of wireless links on platforms that have

1441
01:17:55,580 --> 01:18:00,410
multiple access technologies things that

1442
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:02,980
are more representative of the kinds of

1443
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:06,230
systems that were seeing more of today

1444
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:08,750
so so far I think he has not had any of

1445
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:11,209
them deployed on the mobile network so I

1446
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:13,730
think at the moment it's on fixed

1447
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:15,860
network or Wi-Fi but I think he's

1448
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:19,000
looking into also having additional

1449
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:19,000
access technologies

1450
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:29,800
ready push the brochure IJ um this is

1451
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:33,429
cool and worthwhile we see this being

1452
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:36,460
done in a number of countries the

1453
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:39,220
customer is the regulator so you never

1454
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:42,780
cross the border we're on the global

1455
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:46,510
Internet so you have a special tool here

1456
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:48,969
we have one too hi Jay I mean it's fun

1457
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:51,360
because we host the biggest event in

1458
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:56,910
Japan is the summer highschool baseball

1459
01:18:51,360 --> 01:19:00,460
playoffs 300 terabytes on our network

1460
01:18:56,910 --> 01:19:03,190
okay so we measure it I assure you with

1461
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:07,870
a unique platform one of the wonderful

1462
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:11,200
things about Atlas is it covers the

1463
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:15,790
internet would you people measuring for

1464
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:26,050
your regulators please conspire and have

1465
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:27,850
a uniform platform now Ford just

1466
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:29,890
wondering about the the rebuffering

1467
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:33,239
measurements that you talked about

1468
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:35,910
I wondered if as I know that Google has

1469
01:19:33,239 --> 01:19:38,589
you know measurements for you know a

1470
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:40,059
YouTube rebuffering events by a s I

1471
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:42,590
don't let me share them publicly but I

1472
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:43,770
wondered if you'd consider it

1473
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:46,570
[Music]

1474
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:47,890
collaborating with them to verify the

1475
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:50,530
kind of measurement results that you're

1476
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:54,130
getting or not not necessarily you know

1477
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:57,420
YouTube other other service providers as

1478
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:59,050
a way of at least informally kind of

1479
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:02,890
validating the results that you're

1480
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:04,660
getting I think that iam would be very

1481
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:06,760
happy to do that I don't think he has

1482
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:09,430
done so but I think it's a very good

1483
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,960
idea of course to try and do that and I

1484
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:12,910
mean in general to correlate the

1485
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:16,090
measurement results from from different

1486
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:19,059
sources it's of course very important

1487
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:22,330
yes I work for one of the ice Peace in

1488
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:24,300
Sweden so you're treating seeing that

1489
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:27,040
that's tolling is an indication of

1490
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:30,070
unfair treatment of the traffic is that

1491
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:31,900
what the paper says you see Lester

1492
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:34,829
strolling in YouTube that is indicator

1493
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:38,230
of some differentiation in the network

1494
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:40,929
no no I don't think that's what the

1495
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:44,110
paper says when were what the intention

1496
01:20:40,929 --> 01:20:45,969
is so did these were actually some

1497
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:47,980
different measurements that have been

1498
01:20:45,969 --> 01:20:51,460
done so he's used the platform to look

1499
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:53,259
at you know various aspects so the the

1500
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:55,630
work on the buffer stalling is not

1501
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:59,559
directly related to the net neutrality

1502
01:20:55,630 --> 01:21:02,650
tests okay as far as I understand it I

1503
01:20:59,559 --> 01:21:04,420
mean I have to know the test was serving

1504
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:07,239
him to confirm this of course because

1505
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:09,670
the the timing thread disappear and

1506
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:11,558
check I know a little bit of trouble

1507
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:12,280
classification of traffic for other

1508
01:21:11,559 --> 01:21:16,329
purposes

1509
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:17,829
and I that is not in if that was the

1510
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:21,639
indicator our timing some

1511
01:21:17,829 --> 01:21:24,070
differentiation there you will that will

1512
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:26,980
then be implicit that there are some I

1513
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:29,590
played patrocle than is the trigger for

1514
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:33,480
a differentiated treatment of the

1515
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:36,519
traffic so I don't understand what that

1516
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:39,280
is how that can be an indicator and it

1517
01:21:36,519 --> 01:21:43,449
differentiated treatment the timing in

1518
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:45,309
that disappear so so maybe this was was

1519
01:21:43,449 --> 01:21:46,869
unclear in the presentation I think that

1520
01:21:45,309 --> 01:21:49,269
the three examples that he has in the

1521
01:21:46,869 --> 01:21:51,579
paper for for the type of measurements

1522
01:21:49,269 --> 01:21:57,250
that you can do in the network or not

1523
01:21:51,579 --> 01:22:00,308
directly related to the design of the

1524
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:03,309
net neutrality tests that will be used

1525
01:22:00,309 --> 01:22:05,139
for for measuring that aspect so this is

1526
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:08,699
I think those tests is something that he

1527
01:22:05,139 --> 01:22:12,269
is currently developing together with

1528
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:12,268
discussing with pts

1529
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:24,160
your god I have I had one a bit

1530
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:25,990
follow-up on Randy's point and so if you

1531
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:28,120
look at the if you look at Atlas and

1532
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:30,820
ripe and cheese pie and probably half a

1533
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:35,099
dozen others there's mommy and munroe

1534
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:39,759
probes and so was there any conscious

1535
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:41,080
market placement decision behind the

1536
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,600
development of sensible is there a

1537
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:45,250
specific area that that ian had in mind

1538
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,680
when building this thing that the others

1539
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:50,310
wouldn't cover because most of them are

1540
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,880
also geared towards home network

1541
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:54,190
watching from the home network

1542
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,890
perspective different complexity of

1543
01:22:54,190 --> 01:23:00,250
measurements of course I'm just curious

1544
01:22:55,890 --> 01:23:03,670
I think that when he started from the

1545
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:05,680
very start he did not have that set

1546
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:08,470
perspective now I'm you know just

1547
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:11,950
guessing a bit here because it's not my

1548
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:14,050
work but it started almost like a hobby

1549
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:15,429
project in some sense yeah I think there

1550
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:19,000
the raspberry PI's doing the

1551
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:22,510
measurements time very early on he got

1552
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:27,280
in contact with with pts and they had

1553
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:29,680
done an interest in getting some formal

1554
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:31,750
measurements in Sweden so that's when

1555
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,490
the collaboration started I think that

1556
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:35,440
when he started he did not have that

1557
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:37,960
perspective but it came in very early in

1558
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:40,240
the process because pts was very

1559
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:42,700
interested in the type of platform that

1560
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:44,559
he was developing and he already from

1561
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:46,750
the beginning targeted the home use case

1562
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:49,330
so I mean that I think was the intention

1563
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:51,550
to measure what what type of quality you

1564
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:55,059
see as a home user and it started with

1565
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:57,670
looking at this video and media events

1566
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:59,470
and then seeing what type of service you

1567
01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:01,480
got for those those were the first

1568
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:02,500
measurements II did as far as I know

1569
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,360
okay

1570
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:06,100
the other question I had can I add

1571
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:08,380
something at that point because all the

1572
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:10,510
measurement platforms you mentioned you

1573
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:12,070
see usually very restricted in the

1574
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:13,330
amount of data you can send on the on

1575
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:16,090
this platform just the way they are

1576
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:17,860
designed which doesn't allow you for

1577
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:19,690
like for example high speed tests and

1578
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:23,259
stuff so I think this is probably more

1579
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:25,150
comparable to SEM knows and it's really

1580
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:26,410
also different set of tests you run on

1581
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:27,790
these platforms and you also have a

1582
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:29,349
different agreement with the users who

1583
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:30,929
deploy those platforms because they know

1584
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:32,519
that's regulator test

1585
01:24:30,929 --> 01:24:35,150
so it is a little bit of a difference

1586
01:24:32,519 --> 01:24:38,249
but I think there still is a need to

1587
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:41,009
it'd be nice to kind of map this out and

1588
01:24:38,249 --> 01:24:42,688
what do you what do you use for which as

1589
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:44,489
an external user who might be interested

1590
01:24:42,689 --> 01:24:45,840
in and also which put which platforms

1591
01:24:44,489 --> 01:24:47,489
like what for what that it's also a good

1592
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,630
question can you as next owner user run

1593
01:24:47,489 --> 01:24:51,150
any measurements on this platform

1594
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:52,409
probably not right you can probably talk

1595
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:55,489
to Ian and ask him if you can run

1596
01:24:52,409 --> 01:24:59,009
something for you that's close enough

1597
01:24:55,489 --> 01:25:01,049
yeah I think right now there is not like

1598
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:03,719
open external interface so you can run

1599
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:05,729
it you you can design that the tests are

1600
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:07,380
fairly easy to design as far as to

1601
01:25:05,729 --> 01:25:08,760
understand it I know he's also used it

1602
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:10,800
together with students and they have

1603
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,840
designed you know tests and and they

1604
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,400
have run it on the platform but there as

1605
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:17,820
far as I know there's no like external

1606
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:20,070
interface to access it and run it so

1607
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:22,409
since your said we could map out the

1608
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:24,150
tools we have a research group that's

1609
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:26,610
called the map research group that's

1610
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:28,499
measurement and maybe that would be an

1611
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:31,438
interesting thing to put together as

1612
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:33,949
kind of a directory of the available and

1613
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:37,079
how they differ and how they're the same

1614
01:25:33,949 --> 01:25:38,969
yeah I mean there is which is also

1615
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:40,920
mentioned as related work in this paper

1616
01:25:38,969 --> 01:25:43,320
there is a survey on measurement

1617
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,150
platforms but we could definitely look

1618
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:47,489
further into that and I guess you have

1619
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:49,138
started to collect some of that impor at

1620
01:25:47,489 --> 01:25:51,388
some point it was discussed at least to

1621
01:25:49,139 --> 01:25:54,689
try and do that in in my party right

1622
01:25:51,389 --> 01:25:56,610
so in MapReduce so far we we gave people

1623
01:25:54,689 --> 01:25:58,409
a platform to announce their measurement

1624
01:25:56,610 --> 01:26:00,030
platform but we didn't do any effort in

1625
01:25:58,409 --> 01:26:01,079
trying to compare them or kind of

1626
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:04,469
figuring out what the different

1627
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:05,938
abilities are the platforms provide the

1628
01:26:04,469 --> 01:26:08,099
other small question I had about it was

1629
01:26:05,939 --> 01:26:09,959
about MP TCP since just mentioned that

1630
01:26:08,099 --> 01:26:12,630
there's no cellular right now planned

1631
01:26:09,959 --> 01:26:14,519
I'm wondering how you do multipath TCP

1632
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:16,619
from a home network user if your Wi-Fi

1633
01:26:14,519 --> 01:26:20,429
if your Ethernet and your Wi-Fi connect

1634
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:24,130
to the same ESL line or whatever is

1635
01:26:20,429 --> 01:26:27,319
there anything you have two IP addresses

1636
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:27,319
[Music]

1637
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:36,730
[Laughter]

1638
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:38,500
who I mean answer into this you're you

1639
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:42,870
just use different port names and you

1640
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:42,870
exploit multiple paths up on the network

1641
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:49,559
right but you're but you're categorizing

1642
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:55,959
paths

1643
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:57,370
so given this is given this is an IRT F

1644
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,110
workshop and we're already talking about

1645
01:26:57,370 --> 01:27:00,849
mighty pass TCP I would also like to

1646
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:04,330
announce that there is a new proposed

1647
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:06,790
workshop group workshop research group

1648
01:27:04,330 --> 01:27:08,380
on pasa where networking which looks

1649
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:10,860
into path selection these kind of things

1650
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:13,750
where the first meeting is held on

1651
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:14,679
Wednesday afternoon yeah so if you stay

1652
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:17,530
here for the week that might be

1653
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:19,420
interesting also come to member G the

1654
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:23,290
meeting is Thursday morning on

1655
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:25,150
measurements and I would like to get to

1656
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:26,590
one more point we actually have like 10

1657
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:28,900
more minutes so we keep chat about that

1658
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:30,370
and so the thing I like about this paper

1659
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:32,650
is there's one sentence in the

1660
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:38,110
introduction saying small data can be of

1661
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:40,990
value to and I think it was a little bit

1662
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:42,549
the scheme of all three presentations

1663
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:44,139
that were they were trying to minimize

1664
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:46,270
the amount of measurement danger they

1665
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:47,560
were taking and so I think that's a good

1666
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:49,720
thing I think that's the right thing to

1667
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:50,890
do instead of just collecting huge

1668
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,750
amounts of data and then you don't know

1669
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:54,280
what to do with it but I don't really

1670
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:55,630
understand that much to savannahs

1671
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:57,610
question because I think that somehow

1672
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:59,830
related you try to minimize your data is

1673
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:02,679
so much that you cannot guarantee that

1674
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:04,780
it's statistically significant anymore

1675
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:06,430
and so then you have the fairness issue

1676
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:09,460
but if you just make sure you have

1677
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:10,450
enough data that it's significant there

1678
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,950
shouldn't be a sign of preparedness

1679
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:15,210
question anymore because you actually

1680
01:28:11,950 --> 01:28:18,370
measure what you want to measure nope I

1681
01:28:15,210 --> 01:28:23,100
guess it depends on what you try to

1682
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:25,809
measure it has to be statistically

1683
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:28,390
significant for each operator I guess in

1684
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:30,670
order to to be fair for some of the

1685
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:33,100
measurements we do it as researchers we

1686
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:35,380
may not look for that distinction that

1687
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:39,370
you know we actually want to say

1688
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:41,850
something that is generally relevant on

1689
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:45,699
an operator level we may look for other

1690
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:48,429
other phenomena so

1691
01:28:45,699 --> 01:28:51,730
I think it's it that aspect I think is

1692
01:28:48,429 --> 01:28:53,679
related to the particular aspect of what

1693
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:58,150
you need to actually say something about

1694
01:28:53,679 --> 01:29:01,660
the operators and capturing their

1695
01:28:58,150 --> 01:29:04,449
behavior rather than capturing protocol

1696
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:08,380
behaviors or things that appear in the

1697
01:29:04,449 --> 01:29:14,070
network but I mean in principle I I

1698
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:16,210
agree and I have not that if you have

1699
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:18,370
sufficient amount of data to have

1700
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:21,270
statistically significant results that

1701
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:23,739
that should take care of that

1702
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:25,540
Spencer dawkins it's it seemed like to

1703
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:27,280
me that one one of the things I was

1704
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:29,410
getting out of this was that regulators

1705
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:32,500
could use this not to say that there is

1706
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:34,599
no problem but to say here's something

1707
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:36,480
that we should look at further you know

1708
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,469
so that youth doing small amounts of

1709
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:40,718
doing tests was small amounts of data

1710
01:29:38,469 --> 01:29:42,310
and things like that was valuable to say

1711
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,739
you know to attract their attention on

1712
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:48,429
something where the alternative right

1713
01:29:44,739 --> 01:29:50,468
now is just paper surveys so you know so

1714
01:29:48,429 --> 01:29:52,810
I thought there was that aspect to it as

1715
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:55,000
well that's not saying that you know

1716
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:56,710
it's not saying you've taken your last

1717
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,030
measurement but it's saying that you

1718
01:29:56,710 --> 01:30:02,949
could have used the ones that you've

1719
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:04,660
already taken yes I think certainly it's

1720
01:30:02,949 --> 01:30:06,009
not intended that you just measure and

1721
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:07,570
you have all the answers I mean you

1722
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:10,000
combine it with techniques and you may

1723
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:17,049
need to look further into aspects if you

1724
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:21,449
find something of course really push rij

1725
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:25,660
on a totally different research project

1726
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:29,080
the paper said in the introduction and

1727
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:31,300
in the abstract that it exploited

1728
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:34,239
existing traceroute measurements and

1729
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:37,480
made no new measurements two-thirds of

1730
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:43,718
the reviewers said you created a lot of

1731
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:45,790
unnecessary measurements that's probably

1732
01:30:43,719 --> 01:30:47,110
also good come in maybe figure out which

1733
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:50,730
measurement data are there already

1734
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:50,730
before you try to do new measurements

1735
01:30:50,969 --> 01:30:54,969
okay and I think with this we just

1736
01:30:53,379 --> 01:31:02,260
closed a measurement session here thank

1737
01:30:54,969 --> 01:31:08,309
very much Anna and then we have coffee

1738
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:08,309
outside and see you back in 11:15
