1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,180
okay time for our last session that we

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,740
have a we have a panel that came out of

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,029
a paper submission the panel is going to

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:21,320
be chaired by Leslie Daigle who has been

5
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:23,390
around at the IETF since 1995 so for a

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,890
substantial amount of time so she has

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,390
seen all kinds of ups and downs and

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,829
changes in the Internet and that's

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:32,020
probably puts her into a perfect

10
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:32,020
position to talk about Internet health

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,000
thank you very much so yes this this

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,489
panel came out of a paper that I had

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,739
submitted for this workshop about the

14
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,599
network operator measurements activity

15
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:48,199
that I've been working on you can find

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,679
more information about that WWH org

17
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,929
slash Noma or more likely talk to me

18
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,250
afterwards so we're not actually going

19
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,160
to talk about that although I will

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,920
provide a bit of context from it but

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,599
instead we've got panelists here who are

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,750
very well positioned to talk about

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,540
metrics and internet health I will ask

24
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,490
them later to give more detail the more

25
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,830
detailed introduction themselves but

26
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,699
first I would like to thank John Brosky

27
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,690
from Comcast

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,730
Victor Carr Singh from Oracle now and

29
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:29,690
Robert Kista lucky from ripe ncc for

30
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:32,120
agreeing to be on the panel so yeah so

31
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:36,470
the basic thesis behind me the Noma work

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,330
is to get operators network operators to

33
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,460
self instrument to take measurements

34
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,330
from the edge of their networks towards

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,059
some well known user interesting

36
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,530
resources in the center of the network

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,510
to get a sense of how well their network

38
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,280
is is working let's put it that way

39
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,670
really roughly the measurements are not

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,740
complex things like measuring the time

41
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:03,050
for HTTP connects over v4 and v6 and the

42
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,589
thesis is that maybe a metric like doing

43
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,929
the ratio of v4 and v6 or the difference

44
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,930
between v4 and v6 times will give you

45
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,700
some sense of which protocol is working

46
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,040
best from the vantage point of where

47
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,079
you're testing and if you look at it

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,209
over time you can have some sense of

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,360
whether v6 is getting better or worse or

50
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,820
what so that is an extraordinarily high

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,860
level some nail sketch of what I was

52
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:32,359
talking about just the sort of lay some

53
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:36,050
groundwork for the background that I was

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:40,070
coming from so I did actually have a

55
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,810
panel description instrumenting networks

56
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,269
measurements to track network and

57
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,770
Internet health this panel will explore

58
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,120
the challenges of establishing a

59
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,490
measurement collection framework within

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,930
an operational network instrumenting it

61
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,880
for the purpose of tracking the network

62
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,920
state as well as contributing to a

63
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,370
picture of the overall internet state of

64
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,829
health

65
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,290
apart from narrowing down what internet

66
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,700
health actually means challenges include

67
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,470
choosing measurements that are

68
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,510
meaningful markers are for of user

69
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,100
experience carrying out measurements

70
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,840
within the network without otherwise

71
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,700
impacting the network's performance or

72
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,270
perturbing any target resources at which

73
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,890
measurement traffic is aimed no ddossing

74
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,060
and these and other challenges and

75
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,529
insights will be discussed by the

76
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,820
panelists from operators to

77
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,270
infrastructure operators and network

78
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,670
architects so that's the context of this

79
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,709
panel and at this point I would like to

80
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,049
turn to the panel and ask each person to

81
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:32,480
give a brief introduction of themselves

82
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:40,640
their background in their relationship

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:44,149
to this particular topic okay going from

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,279
left to right apparently so hi I'm

85
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,580
Robert I have been with the ripe NCC for

86
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,250
11 years now coming from security

87
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:55,910
background network security in

88
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,280
particular and then I joined the NCC to

89
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,400
do rpki which some of you might have

90
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,810
heard of protocol work and so on and

91
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,600
later on

92
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,730
join the then forming science team which

93
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,790
is now the rnd team and I'm managing the

94
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,130
R&D team ever since then so the

95
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,840
involvement here is that the the NCC has

96
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,940
been very active in the in the

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,160
measurement and active and passive

98
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,260
measurements of the internet for some

99
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,910
time now some of you know

100
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,880
risks the routing information system

101
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:31,160
that has been collecting BGP data from

102
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,729
around 700 peers or so since 1999 TTM

103
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,099
the test

104
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:37,300
traffic measurements Oh public beta is

105
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:40,058
available soviets goes without saying

106
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,969
the test f ik measurements which were

107
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:45,919
instrumented rack-mounted boxes with gps

108
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:48,589
antennas mounted on roofs and so on so

109
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,609
they can do one-day delay on the one-way

110
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:55,069
delayed measurements with high precision

111
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,979
that was also running for like 12 years

112
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:59,779
or so now it has been superseded so

113
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:04,370
we've been in space for for some time

114
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:08,300
now and somewhere around 2008 ish we

115
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,649
came to realize that there is if network

116
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,169
operators which is our primary concern

117
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:14,029
because we try to serve the ISPs in this

118
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:17,149
region whenever they have questions

119
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:20,058
about I think there is something wrong

120
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:22,159
with the internet it's not me I don't

121
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:23,719
really know who the who causes the

122
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:25,789
problem and if there is a problem but I

123
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:27,949
feel that something is going on there is

124
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:31,460
a disturbance in the force or some

125
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:34,279
someone actually complains about it how

126
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,959
do I go about it how can I figure out

127
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,339
what the problem is where the problem is

128
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,379
and and who is to blame

129
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:42,589
or how more importantly how can we fix

130
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:44,839
it so the only way was to to you know

131
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:46,849
talk to your friends and say I think you

132
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,459
have a machine in in in Vienna right can

133
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,529
I start pinging from there and then you

134
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:54,169
know rarely have those kind of people to

135
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:56,060
support you so the intuition was that

136
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:58,580
that we still need some kind of

137
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,789
measurement network that people can play

138
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:04,430
with and and it gives them enough eyes

139
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:06,620
or vantage points all over the world so

140
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,099
that they can deep up these kind of

141
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,349
problems

142
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:13,248
now the ripe NCC is trying to stay on

143
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:15,259
the network level so our primary concern

144
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:16,819
is the health of the network and not

145
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:20,629
necessarily the health of applications

146
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:24,589
and and various research type of you

147
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:26,959
know weirdly shaped packets and so on

148
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:28,430
but you know those happen as well so we

149
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,509
are trying to stay on the ping trace

150
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,309
route DNS and so NTP level we do have

151
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,349
HTTP measurements as well but they are

152
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:37,909
not publicly available because those

153
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:41,539
reasons that we can go into later if

154
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:44,269
that's a topic but our our approach was

155
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:45,120
to build a basically a community based

156
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:48,720
network

157
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,060
so if someone is willing to extend the

158
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,130
network then we should let them and we

159
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,840
should encourage them but in return they

160
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,120
should get some benefits out of the

161
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,619
network and if I'm assuming that most of

162
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,540
you know what what ripe Atlas is about

163
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,340
that's basically what you get if you run

164
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,850
a probe you can do measurements there is

165
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:10,020
this lose correlation between the two

166
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:12,270
and along this road we we saw that there

167
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,340
is a huge need for easily accessible

168
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,560
tools and visualizations that that

169
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,698
monitored the health if you will

170
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,130
whatever that means

171
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:26,789
and also talking about that but people

172
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:28,830
at least our target audience were people

173
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:31,110
who didn't really want to spend the time

174
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,609
on figuring out how to do a measurement

175
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,220
and then how to interpret the results

176
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,020
what they want is does it work or

177
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,539
doesn't it and if it doesn't who do I

178
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:50,580
talk to and I have to say that's

179
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:54,419
surprisingly difficult to to achieve all

180
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,800
right so my name is Victor coursing I'll

181
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,349
give you a bit of my background and I'll

182
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,490
share some opinions currently working

183
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,590
I'll go backwards

184
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,130
I guess at Oracle as you mentioned we

185
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,840
just got acquired our company was dying

186
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,219
so we were very much on the cloud

187
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,950
services side of the equation at this

188
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,900
point prior to that smallest in an Cisco

189
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,969
and then before that about 13 years in a

190
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,520
service provider up in Canada so doing

191
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,789
Wireless and cable operations and

192
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,320
business operations so I've seen the

193
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:26,909
issue from multiple perspectives and

194
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,919
that includes seeing it from the content

195
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,419
/ service provider you know cloud

196
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:33,208
provider side of it you trying to offer

197
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:35,848
what is an increasingly common

198
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:37,859
phenomenon of a third-party network

199
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,380
offering services into SP networks and

200
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,870
that dynamic of where as where does the

201
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,089
service issues lie seeing it from a

202
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,250
vendor perspective is how the tool our

203
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,620
equipment correctly so that SPS can

204
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,450
leverage or turn on the right functions

205
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,310
to be able to metric your network or

206
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:57,060
take statistics out of it and figure out

207
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,839
what's going on and from the SP side of

208
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,400
the house which was

209
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,710
think back to the late nineties and

210
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,689
early 2000s when we did this a lot of

211
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,150
the functions that we require to

212
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,970
understand that the health these are

213
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:12,010
networks were quite segmented back then

214
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,540
we inherently had that was part and

215
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,670
parcel of that vertical integration we

216
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,589
had way back then and what's happened is

217
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,439
as we've kind of made this more

218
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,570
ubiquitous network and data centers and

219
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,520
things have become more common on a on a

220
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,900
single fabric what's the issue we have

221
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,850
is we haven't replaced all of those

222
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,800
functionalities with a common set of

223
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,810
tools and metrics to be able to

224
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,339
understand how does our service now run

225
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,170
now how do we deal with an

226
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,970
infrastructure that has many services on

227
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,229
it and how do we understand I know you

228
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,150
want to get to the applications later

229
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,400
but how we're going to understand or

230
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,140
what's the right type of data together

231
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,540
here to understand what the implications

232
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,980
will be for the upstream applications so

233
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,540
that's that's kind of my interest area

234
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,770
you know spending a lot of time you know

235
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,900
in terms of architecture design and

236
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,689
operating all these systems from these

237
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,160
different perspectives and I see it as

238
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,250
an increasing challenge because I see

239
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,020
that not only inside the SP or their

240
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,580
applications of their services moving to

241
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,650
these common data centers and how do

242
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,030
they how do they how do they figure out

243
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,010
what's actually happening within the

244
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,270
network as we struggle to that you know

245
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,010
if you go back you've been starting

246
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,900
about five six years ago we struggled

247
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,610
with how do we convert all of these what

248
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,920
used to be these inherent tools we got

249
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,030
from the vendors to what do we create to

250
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,140
be able to understand that and a lot of

251
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,490
the things happening with the internet

252
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,590
and then from the service providers

253
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,420
perspective I mean sort of the content

254
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,250
provider spective or you know the

255
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,229
upstream cloud providers perspective is

256
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,780
how do we access tools or how do we

257
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,390
provide functionality cooperatively with

258
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,920
the ESPE so we understand the health so

259
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,510
we don't get this finger-pointing or we

260
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,430
don't you know where does the problem

261
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,500
lie is that in the access network is it

262
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,449
in this these increasingly complex

263
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,520
backbone networks or is it in the

264
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,050
interconnection layer between all the

265
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,760
providers or is it inside the cloud

266
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,439
providers infrastructure and how do we

267
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,600
tool these two to get meaning out of

268
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,610
them in a common way so we can I think

269
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,370
they fix problems in in really

270
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:02,250
understanding health and attributes of

271
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,250
applications so that's my first synopsis

272
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:07,779
thanks Victor my name is John verzasca

273
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,579
from Comcast

274
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:13,519
been with the company for a long time

275
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:15,290
going on 12 years now so that so you

276
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,370
know anybody who knows me here the vast

277
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,259
majority of what I've done over the past

278
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:22,490
decade changes I've led the company's

279
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:23,870
efforts to adopt v6 so about you know

280
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,970
probably the best way to describe this

281
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,870
is the you know first few years of the

282
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,579
company were a lot of you know thankless

283
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,309
work to upgrade the infrastructure right

284
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:37,160
infrastructure that actually had no

285
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:39,680
visible benefits or movement from the

286
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,689
public's point of view upgrading servers

287
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,579
operating systems products what-have-you

288
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:45,589
so about seven years ago six years ago

289
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:47,959
is when we started to really launch

290
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:49,610
things that we're gonna end up in our

291
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:51,378
customers homes

292
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,480
around that same time when we were

293
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:55,069
getting ready to do that yeah we talked

294
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,899
to it you know got all the right

295
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:59,449
provable internally one of the one of

296
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:02,420
the kind of the requests air quotes was

297
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:07,219
don't break him thing got it don't break

298
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:10,189
anything right so so that ended up kind

299
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,139
of blossom me into one ended up being an

300
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,670
opportunity for us to kind of measure

301
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,870
ourselves right initially it was from a

302
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,429
binary point of you to make sure that we

303
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,499
didn't break anything right to follow

304
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:21,110
our you know the kind of the mandate

305
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:23,540
from our leaders turns out over the

306
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,579
years you know we ended up building

307
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,410
extraordinary relationships with many

308
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,479
other partners in the ecosystem which

309
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,610
we'll talk about here in a few minutes

310
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,230
but it's also really kind of gone to

311
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,120
tignous and a couple of paths right it's

312
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,129
you know when we when we deployed me six

313
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,620
as part of kind of enabling it on our

314
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:41,360
infrastructure we did it in a way that

315
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,470
we didn't just simply carry forward the

316
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,300
things that were done in before we

317
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,379
looked at different that you know v6 is

318
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,508
an opportunity to do things differently

319
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:49,370
better you know optimizers if there's

320
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:51,290
things in baggage that was happening

321
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,660
that was in place before we wanted to

322
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,429
like take that as an opportunity to

323
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,999
perhaps not do that again but from a v6

324
00:12:55,429 --> 00:13:00,980
point of view that in turn led to a

325
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:02,420
series of interesting phases where we

326
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,550
said hey well let's just take this from

327
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,040
not a binary approach to measuring oh

328
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,990
you know you know are we broken or not -

329
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,360
hey wait a minute now what's the

330
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:15,319
difference between v4 and v6 oh and by

331
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,179
the way in many cases v6 outperforms v4

332
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:18,110
one of those scenarios what can we

333
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:19,730
explore there

334
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,280
and then finally yeah I think the

335
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,440
chapter that is about to be upon us

336
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,079
maybe in some places is upon us is what

337
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,770
happens when before starts to degree

338
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,390
right you can't go back and measure

339
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,189
right you can't go back in time right so

340
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,569
you know starting these measurements and

341
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,490
letting them run for extended periods of

342
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,320
time is critical right and at least

343
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,000
having that you know foundational

344
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,550
baseline data is essentially you should

345
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,080
never go back in time to reget it right

346
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:50,089
so t0 you can't go back to right so with

347
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,560
that you know Leslie I'll turn it over

348
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,240
you but you know but that's the

349
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,880
fundamental premise around why I think

350
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,640
you know I'm up here right great thanks

351
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,060
so I sent you all some questions that we

352
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:06,319
had to UM and let me now start with one

353
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:08,359
that wasn't among those questions um by

354
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,670
just sort of to to put a little bit of a

355
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,010
finer point on it and at least two of

356
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,079
you brought up the notion of you know

357
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,510
doing measurements can can help you see

358
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,810
where there are actually problems in the

359
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,830
network I wonder if one one or more of

360
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,260
you would like to give a concrete

361
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,820
example to the room of where simple

362
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,310
measurements can let you see something

363
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:37,250
this fundamental and important in the

364
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:40,339
state of the network I have two one that

365
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:44,090
was a big bet it dates back to world we

366
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:46,610
six launched was that 2012 right yeah

367
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:49,280
and when that's happening right now

368
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:52,010
right so when a good friend of mine Paul

369
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,630
saw the Facebook right so I was visiting

370
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,090
Paul and his office and at the time I

371
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,560
guess was Palo Alto and he's like hey

372
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,930
it's so it's a month before the event

373
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,510
because hey let's uh let's turn b61 and

374
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,829
comp case nowhere I said okay let's just

375
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,960
hanging around saying hey yeah why don't

376
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,760
we turn on v6 I said listen let's let's

377
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,080
you know refill the beer first and let's

378
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,080
give it again let's get let's give it a

379
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,580
go right so and I said hold on a second

380
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,680
I said let me let me plug in you know

381
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,620
dub-dub-dub that peaceful calm into kind

382
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,660
of like the system right talk about what

383
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,730
the system is later and he turns it on

384
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,469
we go back at him by T come back and I

385
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,770
said said dude you might want to turn

386
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,390
that off so it turns out in that case

387
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,590
and this is exactly the kind of

388
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,699
relations that I'm describing that

389
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,189
blossom yeah that

390
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:35,748
really helps the internet ecosystem get

391
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:37,279
together and fix things that affect

392
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:39,919
millions of people on the Internet

393
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,089
turns out you know the v4 traffic was

394
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,169
being served at is something relatively

395
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:46,459
close to Chicago and then Chicago but v6

396
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:48,769
was being served someplace and like the

397
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:50,209
northwest of the countries I'm like yeah

398
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:52,129
that's not horrible it's not broken but

399
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:54,108
it's not you know the best so turned it

400
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:55,999
off you know you know you went off and

401
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:59,480
did some things dubbed a Tuco's by

402
00:15:55,999 --> 00:16:00,799
turnback on looks good right yeah so

403
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,629
that was really more of like is it

404
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,129
broken or not right and then setting

405
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:08,689
lately you know we have situation with

406
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:11,299
with a Content owner and a CDN where I

407
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:13,759
happen to be measuring you know so these

408
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:16,429
relationships have kind of teamed - to

409
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,379
blossom the CDN the condom owner is

410
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:19,879
basically LinkedIn right and then I and

411
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,739
I get a bunch of requests from them that

412
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,119
says hey you know what's it look like

413
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:24,290
when your network how's things going

414
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:26,689
because we're getting some reports of

415
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,660
some some weird you know issues right so

416
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:31,488
you plug in you don't LinkedIn URL and

417
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,079
then collect some data for a while and

418
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:36,109
what we're finding is is that there are

419
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:38,388
there are issues both on my side and on

420
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:40,850
you know another third-party side where

421
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:42,709
it's potentially affecting you know kind

422
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,850
of the customers again not not broken

423
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:46,429
but like you know again opt

424
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,169
opportunities for optimization right and

425
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:50,509
the measurements Leslie you know and if

426
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:51,049
you want to get into this later that'd

427
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,879
be great

428
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:54,769
they're not sophisticated you know it's

429
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,629
basically a wrapper built around Lib

430
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:58,489
curl right that basically does you know

431
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,009
DNS lookup TCP connect and download time

432
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:02,600
very simple for v4 v6 which you have

433
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:03,829
distributed through your network yeah

434
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,019
that's correct

435
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:09,529
that's right not not entirely what

436
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:10,638
vechta but enough anybody else I'm gonna

437
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,929
switch microphones on you because I

438
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:13,928
think this one's easier for you to pass

439
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:21,079
grab on to examples one will actually

440
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,419
reiterate something that John just said

441
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,459
and then I'll jump into a second one

442
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:28,519
from a different perspective so - the

443
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:32,000
same event different network ipv6 Day

444
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:35,840
2012 when we were amping up to it we saw

445
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,820
a very similar issue and on the dns to

446
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,899
go into the details what we found on our

447
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,918
SP side network was that you know one

448
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:44,658
can argue just came down to design

449
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,200
Delta's this will continue to be true

450
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:47,269
between the

451
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,440
46 you know the v6 network was built

452
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,970
differently because was supposed to be

453
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,679
built better you know why do we have to

454
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,049
go back to the v4 world let's not make

455
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,850
this and say 100% congruent and what we

456
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:57,440
found was yeah traffic was just

457
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,529
inherently routed differently policy

458
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,570
points in the network how we did how we

459
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,490
did Egypt policy across the network and

460
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,990
how we advertise things although

461
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,480
supposed to be the same basic general

462
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,010
anycast DNS distribution so the network

463
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,169
wound up taking traffic to different

464
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,730
data centers and when we when we work

465
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:15,470
backwards through the problem and found

466
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,120
out where the issues were and by the way

467
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,980
these we found the issues because this

468
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,449
painstakingly like truck trial and error

469
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,029
you know what's going on here why is

470
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,200
this happening wasn't instrumented you

471
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:26,029
know we find discovered well you know

472
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,100
there's issues within the network and

473
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:29,779
how the config was done and we found out

474
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,299
was a lot of manual processes on the v6

475
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,409
side was quite new back then so you know

476
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,850
that's just to reiterate one of the

477
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:36,139
things that John said that we found that

478
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,120
so it's more than one network had the

479
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:39,408
same or similar kinds of issues we were

480
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,309
ramped up there and it was one of those

481
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,110
Wow

482
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:43,519
you know this is a this condition

483
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:47,539
actually happen and we've had other

484
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:50,120
examples another perspective is I find

485
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:51,529
implementations are different differed

486
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,350
between vendors I'm not going to give

487
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:55,519
away any vendor quip in this point but

488
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,799
one of the things we found more recently

489
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,500
was we had an issue where before

490
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,360
actually kind of sucked and we didn't

491
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,679
have a v6 problem with this specific

492
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,479
traffic flow when you were at frame rail

493
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,340
you know was what's going on our UDP

494
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,480
traffic it looks like it's being dropped

495
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,428
from the floor or going into this data

496
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,799
center what's happening well we realize

497
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:14,720
now this might be that the v6

498
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,629
implementation of a ologies was broken

499
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,210
but it sure performed very differently

500
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,860
between v4 and v6 so we got a totally

501
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:26,299
fundamental that from behavior between

502
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:28,908
v4 and v6 in terms of how UDP traffic

503
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:30,408
was being managed and this there was

504
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:33,230
some asynchronous nature going on

505
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:34,820
without going to the big details now had

506
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,470
we been able to instrument network we

507
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:41,000
could have found this problem a lot

508
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:42,880
sooner than then by the way SPS will buy

509
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,809
the exact same equipment we were using

510
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,970
instances we could have found this

511
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,889
problem allows sooner not waited for you

512
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,080
know incredible number of tickets a lot

513
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:52,908
of problems a lot of issues a lot of

514
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,289
trolling a lot of man-hours and you know

515
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:56,840
I'd rather spend that be honest you

516
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:57,640
doing actual network implementation or

517
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,659
as opposed to

518
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,580
just troubleshooting troubleshooting

519
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,420
troubleshooting so it took a long time

520
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,199
to find this so we're seeing just

521
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,330
implementation issues are hard to find

522
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,679
so instrumenting things can help us find

523
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:17,010
things in this particular case you know

524
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:19,120
before actually sucked more than v6 I am

525
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,250
constantly surprised about how much

526
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,250
value researchers can squeeze out from

527
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:27,549
the same data set they today and that

528
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:29,590
that just it's just it's just the thing

529
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:31,900
that we are still using the tools that

530
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:36,730
we've been using 40 years ago literally

531
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:39,549
ping trace route DNS lookup and the

532
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,530
volume has changed a lot and I think in

533
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:43,900
terms of you know detecting problems

534
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,399
with v4 with v6 which one's better what

535
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,059
has changed

536
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,540
having a significant amount of constant

537
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:56,500
data inflow helps a lot we are measuring

538
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:58,178
something like 4,500 results a second

539
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,210
that's what we collect so 400 million

540
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:02,799
data points a day which is more than

541
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,169
enough to pinpoint problems when they

542
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,570
occur the trick is one of the tricks is

543
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:09,760
that it's nice to to collect baseline

544
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,189
there so you know referring back to

545
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,590
previous examples if you knew how the

546
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,400
network behaved before the problem came

547
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,959
and now you measure how it is behaving

548
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,480
then you can compare and say that's the

549
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,630
problem right there once you have a

550
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,000
problem and then you start to measure

551
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:32,320
you know it's a bit more difficult and

552
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,900
but it had a couple of times when when

553
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,480
my colleagues developed tools that just

554
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,070
took significant amounts of data and

555
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,500
just you know merge them all together

556
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,980
and say this one is the outlier that one

557
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:49,570
is the outlier we built like traceroute

558
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:52,390
tools where a an operator can say show

559
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:56,070
me how the world sees my website or can

560
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:58,480
trace to me on v4 and on v6 and then it

561
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,059
visualized that and suddenly when you

562
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,190
see instead of a tree if you know all

563
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:05,470
those sources come to you you see a

564
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,580
forest this is this these guys get to

565
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,340
you and those are blocked blocked

566
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,840
blocked that helps a lot and then you

567
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,199
can compare what is the difference

568
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,470
between

569
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,450
before and v6 here and that's just one

570
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:23,769
simple tool and you can extract a lot of

571
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:25,480
value from it okay so I want to hold on

572
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:28,149
to this thought of the sort of the

573
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,100
simple tools the 40-year old tools for

574
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:32,018
measuring Internet infrastructure and

575
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,490
the value that you can get from it I'd

576
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:36,610
like to switch gears just a little bit

577
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:40,750
to another question that we had

578
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:43,658
discussed an email before which is a lot

579
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:46,360
of what matters at least for access

580
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:49,240
providers is how are the users

581
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,490
perceiving the network these they're

582
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,620
their use of the network if they don't

583
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,779
particularly touch the network itself

584
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,570
the network infrastructure so how can

585
00:22:55,779 --> 00:23:00,610
you make the leap from what you can

586
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,470
measure within network infrastructure to

587
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,918
getting some sense of how is this

588
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:08,460
working

589
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:11,080
for the users I think that's really hard

590
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,870
especially if you if you look at the

591
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,789
fact that the technology that the end

592
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:23,229
users interact with changes so quickly

593
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:26,230
quickly even so it's really difficult to

594
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,120
have measurement points inside your

595
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,730
network or inside your customers network

596
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,039
that try to simulate what the users will

597
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,500
see basically you have to re-implement

598
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,610
the heavy eyeballs as those guys did it

599
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,350
over there but if your population

600
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,019
happens to prefer a different browser

601
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:45,570
then their experience will be different

602
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:47,860
so in that sense the only real user

603
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:50,950
specific metric like well how do the

604
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,779
users feel about this change would be

605
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,909
the actual end client that the user is

606
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:56,799
using and that's kind of difficult to

607
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:59,710
get to and limited people try that and

608
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,559
some some plugins still work but I do

609
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,210
feel that on the network level we can do

610
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,389
a lot of measurements and a lot of

611
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,700
guesswork and some of that guesswork is

612
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:12,158
pretty accurate but it's never going to

613
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,500
be the same that the user experiences so

614
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:18,610
that's it might be a personal opinion

615
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,350
but I think that's difficult yeah so

616
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,850
it's fascinating even the way that we've

617
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,100
done some of the measurements that we

618
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,750
were we were doing for a while now you

619
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,669
know

620
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,290
we can we can kind of initiate many of

621
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,320
these and that's frankly why we chose

622
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:33,060
HTTP because HTTP vertically when you

623
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,360
include all the protocols that go into

624
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,980
kind of an HTP exchange it's like it's

625
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,229
it's pretty good place to start I mean

626
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,930
is it perfect is it'll come saying no

627
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:45,510
but it's it's yeah it's got a like a

628
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,590
very long runway of things to factor in

629
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,030
I mean there's there's plenty of work

630
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:51,330
that can be done just on that vertical

631
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:52,860
space alone and what we've also noticed

632
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,689
in our in error in our network you know

633
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,889
ours is pretty big nationwide network so

634
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,350
we have these regions you know Boston

635
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:00,540
Philadelphia Atlanta Chicago Denver you

636
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,699
know San Jose San Francisco we have

637
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,920
probes that are kind of generally in

638
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,420
each of those regions right one of the

639
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,810
things that we think that could you know

640
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:12,480
really help to augment that is kind of

641
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,490
pushing it closer to where the customer

642
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,980
resides topologically in a network right

643
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,290
and to Robert's point even then it's not

644
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,380
exactly perfect but I mean it's it still

645
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:24,540
represents a kind of cornucopia of data

646
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,830
opportunities to really analyze and

647
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,659
evaluate what that experience was like

648
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,060
ultimately after they is done it's

649
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,260
really something like this right that I

650
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,330
think the Roberts point you have to

651
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,710
factor in what the kind of the visual

652
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:38,250
experience is what kind of computer does

653
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:41,070
it does the user have etc but but absent

654
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,900
that there's still like tons of

655
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:47,610
opportunity to really evaluate what the

656
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:53,160
potential impact customer experience as

657
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:56,070
well to try to tied into some of the

658
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,420
stuff that was discussed earlier today I

659
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,860
think that what you're saying is it's

660
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,410
it's probably pretty hard to get the

661
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,149
fine grained tracking of user experience

662
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,190
at the level of trying to see why or

663
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:09,930
where there are hiccups for instance in

664
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:13,080
a particular audio-visual stream but at

665
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:14,820
the level of detecting when you go out a

666
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,030
DNS server that is not doing the right

667
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:21,540
geolocation and descending a Boston

668
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,820
customer to the San Francisco instance

669
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,170
of something I mean I think you can you

670
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,629
can measure user experience at that

671
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:29,610
level that was exactly the the issue

672
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,190
that we had with with LinkedIn recently

673
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,928
right somehow with you know the the

674
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,540
anycast DNS servers that we said to the

675
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:38,460
customers the cluster in a particular

676
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,500
region was not go

677
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,600
was not enabling the proper geo and

678
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,010
people in a certain part country would

679
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
go and just accept the work going

680
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,400
completely somewhere else so that could

681
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,350
be a byproduct of you know routing

682
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,150
policy of the Comcast network you know

683
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,399
something with the DNS infrastructure it

684
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,780
could have been a byproduct of their CDN

685
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,430
provider not having a rate geolocation

686
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,430
map before the Comcast network great

687
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,479
victory you wanna see something yeah I

688
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,820
felt like I wanted to say something and

689
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,110
this was kind of lines and this was more

690
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,659
like I raise a question we were talking

691
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,909
about in the background thinking back to

692
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,440
the content imagine you were watching

693
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,500
some kind of streaming content from a

694
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,020
very popular provider at home you know

695
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,760
one of the things that I grappled with

696
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,230
is how do we understand what the quality

697
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,210
is that you do I understand the

698
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,850
infrastructure side that's is if we

699
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,160
understand what we need to instrument to

700
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,139
kind of get a a course view of how the

701
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,150
infrastructure is actually working so

702
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,800
you know John and I could be in our

703
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,870
relative homes we could both be in

704
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,220
Philadelphia and I moved there and if

705
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,469
we're both watching this content you

706
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,780
know this content you know suddenly for

707
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,450
some reason there's a a red drop

708
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,310
somewhere in the network he drops down

709
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,290
and bandwidth for his stream you know so

710
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,510
he's no longer getting his 4k or HD

711
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:53,670
signal on that on that stream but I I

712
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,140
was fine you know I didn't get that my

713
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,520
random red drop on red or somewhere in

714
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,900
the middle of the network and so the

715
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,790
question is was the internet good at

716
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,830
that moment in time was it it wasn't

717
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:04,610
appearing problem likely may or may not

718
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:06,540
been something on this on the I exchange

719
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,310
probably not an issue in the content

720
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,350
side may be somewhere in the middle of

721
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,310
his network maybe it was on the access

722
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,469
network where that happened but the

723
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,970
question I have is I don't you know is

724
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,400
that good that means that there was a

725
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,990
problem at work probably at that macro

726
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,690
scale there really was no issues there

727
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,760
but his experience was that there was an

728
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,470
issue he he no longer saw his you know

729
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,530
high-definition video come through on a

730
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:30,240
streaming service so that's where you

731
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,620
know I you know I try to figure out how

732
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,870
we were gonna get a correlation between

733
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,419
the user experience and is there a way

734
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:39,629
to do that with infrastructure data back

735
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,160
in the old days 15 years ago video was

736
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,260
totally different in an SP network I

737
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,970
mean we instrumented right down between

738
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,000
set-top boxes and where the video was

739
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,340
feeding and as the old and old MPEG

740
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,050
feeds we so we understood artifacts we

741
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,580
understood macro blocking very well

742
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,950
there was a high correlation between

743
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,419
what you saw in the TV and all the

744
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,310
instrumentation happened this vertical

745
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,170
stack and what we got so we knew what

746
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:03,659
was happening but now in this more

747
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,190
ubiquitous space it's really hard in my

748
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,620
mind to kind of create that connection

749
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,740
and we you know how to how to recreate

750
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:14,610
what we used to have all right I'm gonna

751
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,870
stop pressing that button um I had to do

752
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:19,199
it once more to get it to move back on

753
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,189
um I have a question I want to follow up

754
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:32,610
but Ren do you look like you're being

755
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:38,360
patient two words a thousand eyes our

756
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:38,360
biggest customers use dollars okay

757
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:48,389
sounds like some homework where I was

758
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,360
gonna go and I will go since I I'm not

759
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,290
gonna Google that right this minute um

760
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,629
it kind of sounds like what's being

761
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,740
described here is that from the

762
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,130
perspective we're talking about today

763
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:01,350
it's not really particularly possible to

764
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,850
simulate or measure the exact user

765
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,189
experience because of all the reasons

766
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,659
that you raised Robert for instance but

767
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:11,190
we might be able to start getting to the

768
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:13,980
question of how well is is the network

769
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,270
for some value of the network serving

770
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,540
and customers

771
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:21,570
although Victor you were suggesting that

772
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,730
in our in our multifaceted world today

773
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,220
even that's pretty hard to come up with

774
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:30,330
a baseline what should the network be

775
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:32,130
doing in order to serve people well yeah

776
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,590
just add that I mean interesting what

777
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,480
Rennie mentioned there may be some

778
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:39,000
homework to be done but the the the

779
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,350
thing is all the network's not also

780
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,720
created equal right so they're all

781
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:45,959
designed to some different level of

782
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,060
function so the way Comcast might design

783
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,090
their network is fundamentally different

784
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,639
than the way we designed the our cable

785
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:56,730
network that we had our lab works to

786
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,310
look nothing alike so you know the

787
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:01,830
question is we might get different user

788
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:03,300
experience but the other thing too is

789
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,470
maybe they were both good in our each

790
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,539
one of our own eyes

791
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,600
all right so as we're sliding downhill

792
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:14,139
towards a sense of despair and a morass

793
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:17,350
of negativity so how about the health of

794
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:21,580
the Internet is there any way in which

795
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:23,289
we can I'm gonna be positive we can talk

796
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,110
about health metrics not from the

797
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:28,179
standpoint of being able to answer all

798
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,090
questions but at least from the

799
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:32,590
standpoint as John was articulating it

800
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:35,769
creating baselines let me let's make

801
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,509
this T zero and start measuring some

802
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:42,009
things some pretty basic things so that

803
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:43,210
when when we subjectively decide that

804
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:45,039
things are not working well in the

805
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,049
internet we can turn to some objective

806
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,669
metrics and say this is what has changed

807
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:50,860
or this is what is different in this

808
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:53,019
network versus that network over there

809
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,850
and if we were gonna do that sort of

810
00:31:53,019 --> 00:32:03,970
thing what might be some of those things

811
00:31:54,850 --> 00:32:05,699
that we could measure and find useful so

812
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,419
do I have to pretend like today's T zero

813
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,440
as you like have a so I'll share a few

814
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:13,179
things that we're looking at lately

815
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,690
right so one of the things that we look

816
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:19,659
at mean is is the the DNS right so one

817
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:21,190
of the things that we found is and I was

818
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:23,230
talking to a lot of ISE guys over the

819
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,179
past couple of several ITF so he said

820
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,330
hey you know we think there's something

821
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:30,700
up with kind of DNS the DNS in general

822
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:33,460
on the air quotes capital I Internet

823
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,259
we're like you know it seems to be and

824
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,600
this is a few years ago seems to be like

825
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:39,850
just you know grossly biased towards I

826
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,559
could be forward no no you know that

827
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,629
can't be the case you're like yeah we

828
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,309
think it is so we did some did some

829
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:47,918
digging and obviously if you don't have

830
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:50,559
a good path to you know recursion over

831
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,840
v6 and you know the DNS will do the

832
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,889
right thing it'll use before turns out

833
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,600
there's there's a lot more than that

834
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:58,899
even internally on our network our

835
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,879
recursive name servers we're not there

836
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:04,149
was a bug plus it was not configured as

837
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:05,678
such to prefer recursion over v6 first

838
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,969
wait you know I think where I were

839
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,690
described happy eyeballs maybe was

840
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:14,230
Victor so we ran some tests and we found

841
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:16,119
out that you know recursion DNS

842
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:19,000
recursion over v6 was actually faster

843
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:22,600
than IP v4 there's it there

844
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,429
ten cases the Comcast network two Asian

845
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,139
authoritative DNS servers that were

846
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:27,549
pretty bad but you know I can pick up

847
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,890
the phone make a few phone calls to say

848
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:31,780
hey you know something at dot I in or

849
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,640
something dot or whatever you got it you

850
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,549
gotta fix this thing up right but the

851
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,130
vast majority of it was like v6 was

852
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:41,080
outperforming before right so that was

853
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,429
one of those scenarios where we had you

854
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,399
know the measurements that we started at

855
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:47,530
t zero five weeks five six years ago

856
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,750
that actually sprung board into other

857
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,129
opportunities to basically improve the

858
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,919
customer experience and with the

859
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,970
performance of the address

860
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,980
so you're saying and even doing just

861
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,710
sort of basic baseline measurements

862
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:02,559
about timings for doing DNS lookups

863
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,840
towards popular websites looking at

864
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,629
things like overall time to load four

865
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,730
page requests and whatnot provides some

866
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:14,260
level of building blocks for addressing

867
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:16,300
questions didn't even just do a DNS

868
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,220
query right now have to have DNS cluster

869
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,929
out there that only has a v6 interfaces

870
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:21,129
and just do the DNS queries to figure

871
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,480
out you know load up the Alexa top

872
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:25,029
whatever right I think that's what we

873
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,109
ended up doing and see what the DNS

874
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,240
lookup times were right

875
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:34,149
yeah not the Alexa talk it's what no the

876
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:36,428
Cisco top million now right so just to

877
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:38,770
kind of jump on one of the things that

878
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,480
you're saying I think DNS now I have to

879
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,250
remember there's some bias here at this

880
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,639
point because I have to be working for

881
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:47,770
coming in makes money serving the DNS so

882
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,089
trying not to take off the bias head try

883
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,239
and take off the bias I cannot have a

884
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:55,379
bias is I think that's a really good

885
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:59,140
space because it's it's a fundamental

886
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:00,640
part of the experience of a lot of usage

887
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,560
of the internet right so you're not

888
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,049
often the dark web somewhere so it's

889
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,720
it's a fundamental part of that

890
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,339
experience right a lot of a lot of what

891
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,509
the customer will see has to do with you

892
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:15,310
know DNS performance and it also to make

893
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,410
that work right a lot of infrastructural

894
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,750
things have to be right or wrong now we

895
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,490
get escalated on quite a bit because you

896
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:24,250
know if you're hosting some big-name

897
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:26,500
brands what happens is you get a quick

898
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,180
aggregate of problems and you notice it

899
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,680
pretty fast and we've had to

900
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:32,560
troubleshoot with other with other

901
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,250
providers you know anomalies in their v4

902
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,710
and v6

903
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,320
routing a lot in the visa product face

904
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,760
you'd be amazed at how reformed be sick

905
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,470
to perform fundamentally if in terms of

906
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,900
how people happen to route that across

907
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,759
their networks and so you know as we've

908
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,260
had to fix a lot of infrastructure

909
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,090
things that seem to have nothing to do

910
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,340
with Dean s you know like your red you

911
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:53,230
know your PGP you know you say no export

912
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,790
you do an you do an export or you know

913
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,410
fundamental things you think should be

914
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,380
working don't work and so we worked out

915
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,940
we wound up fixing just because of just

916
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,000
basic routing issues and other people

917
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,530
and or our network and obviously it goes

918
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,220
up and fix the DNS base so I think

919
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:15,640
measuring that has a lot of flow through

920
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:17,200
benefits as well okay so I'm gonna open

921
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,569
up the floor to questions from the

922
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,460
audience and while you're organizing

923
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,410
yourselves towards the mic and I'll

924
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:26,020
throw out one question to you Robert

925
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:27,790
with the Alice infrastructure or the

926
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,830
measurements infrastructure in general

927
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:32,020
have you have you noticed differences

928
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:35,740
over the last few years shall we say of

929
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,000
how who is using the infrastructure and

930
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,200
how they're using what kinds of

931
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,660
questions they seem to be trying to

932
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:45,460
answer or is that not something that you

933
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:47,170
have any can get any insight into there

934
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,730
is interesting enough a research paper

935
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,700
published by Randy and his friends

936
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,650
looking at who is actually using right

937
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,220
path less so I think that the the title

938
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:59,530
was measuring the measures or so so who

939
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,709
are using right but less than Y and what

940
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,700
kind of behavior they they show and they

941
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,650
identified

942
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:08,200
I'm not alternative to talk about the

943
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:10,810
paper but they identified two classes of

944
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,220
people one who really know what they are

945
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:14,410
measuring so they have a specific

946
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,959
problem and now they are shooting out a

947
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:19,089
bunch of measurement requests and then

948
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,480
trying to parse the results and figuring

949
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:25,690
out what's going on and then the other

950
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,340
class of people is I'm trying to stay

951
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,920
away from their terminology the other

952
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:32,290
class of people were the people who just

953
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,750
did measurements all over like give me

954
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:37,150
everything measure everything and and I

955
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,650
wouldn't want to download it all and

956
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:44,230
then figure out what I actually wanted

957
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:46,779
to figure out so so so those still exist

958
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,339
our original goal was to address

959
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:52,029
operators because we thought that they

960
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:54,279
need this tool and I'm very happy to

961
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:55,989
report that like two or three years

962
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:57,909
after we started and we had to push a

963
00:37:55,989 --> 00:37:59,619
bit at the beginning but two or three

964
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:02,289
years after we started seeing talks

965
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:04,900
appearing from operators at various

966
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:06,249
conferences that said oh I actually had

967
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,650
the problem and I use that list for this

968
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:11,799
exact so that nowadays if you go to a

969
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:14,650
rite meeting or virtually any other rir

970
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:16,569
meetings and even here there is a talk

971
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:19,259
every session or every day at the minute

972
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:23,288
I'm saying hey by the way we use this

973
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:26,169
which is really nice besides this I did

974
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:30,279
see a huge take up in researchers using

975
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:32,049
FS and I'm very proud of that and it's

976
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:33,929
just one thing that researchers will try

977
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:36,339
to get their hands on anything they can

978
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:38,709
when they think that there is value to

979
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:40,419
be extracted there but I think there is

980
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:42,819
more and more and more conscious users

981
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:47,288
of Atlas because there are specific

982
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:50,109
questions that the researchers feel that

983
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:54,189
this platform may not be the best but at

984
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:57,419
least it's there it's usable and it can

985
00:38:54,189 --> 00:39:00,308
provide insight and that's useful for

986
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:03,519
for the operator community as well in

987
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:05,319
the end especially if if the outcome of

988
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,390
the research is something tangible where

989
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:09,308
people can just say I understand what

990
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,499
you did and I understand how can I apply

991
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:20,019
that to my own network that's fine

992
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:21,129
useful before hearing like one of the

993
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:23,109
things that you said you know measuring

994
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,929
everything so when you have a generic

995
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:29,049
routine that you just like plug in a URL

996
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:30,609
to test - it's easy and tempting to like

997
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:32,529
want to measure everything's right to

998
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:35,109
Robert's point but man I got to tell you

999
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:36,759
when you do that and take it out - take

1000
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:38,409
it from me you know because we got there

1001
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:39,640
at one point the the volume of data that

1002
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,769
you end up having to kind of sift

1003
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,229
through it's not only is it distracting

1004
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:46,238
but it's almost becomes an impossibility

1005
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:47,259
honestly so like there is so that

1006
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,939
there's some of the measurements that we

1007
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:52,569
ended up you know that we're still doing

1008
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:56,288
you know we ended up re configuring them

1009
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:58,209
to be very explicitly targeted towards

1010
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:59,619
like internal endpoints so that we kind

1011
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:00,848
of get back to the basics but there is

1012
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:02,650
there is a

1013
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:05,200
dangerous side effect alike this

1014
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:14,529
temptation of measuring everything my

1015
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:19,450
pacemaker right Aaron so um my day job

1016
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:21,430
I've run into a bunch of stuff related

1017
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,129
to any cast I'm discovering that any

1018
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:26,769
cast is a real pain in the ass to to

1019
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,479
diagnose some wonder term right that's a

1020
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:31,029
technical term I it's a technical term I

1021
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:32,769
use rather frequently I'm wondering

1022
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:35,710
whether is this something that you guys

1023
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:37,779
are seeing thinking about is there a

1024
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:39,789
need for tools as any cast like on your

1025
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:45,339
radar or is it such a small amount of

1026
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:47,109
stuff that you don't care so talk a

1027
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:50,470
little bit about any casting that we use

1028
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:52,598
a lot of it yeah I mean I think getting

1029
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,488
tooling around and how any cast because

1030
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,880
the Trish you know traditional

1031
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:59,200
traditional networking you're not gonna

1032
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,869
necessarily understand how in any cast

1033
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,598
excretion works very well you obviously

1034
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:06,549
can test for multiple points and etc the

1035
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,229
other thing that's unique unique about

1036
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:10,630
any cast depending if it's inside a

1037
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:12,430
network it behaves one way when it

1038
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,640
behaves across networks it behaves

1039
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:17,769
totally different again so when you're

1040
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,379
doing you know between between networks

1041
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:22,359
and that behavior has to do with while

1042
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,700
you're it's the you know the political

1043
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:26,078
layer of how we route traffic so things

1044
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,089
that you think we're going to happen

1045
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,769
don't actually happen and it's a

1046
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:30,940
fundamental thing we grapple with every

1047
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:32,348
single day and that we're one of those

1048
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,390
networks that have to go between

1049
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:35,799
networks so what we did with it there's

1050
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:38,200
not what the next provider will do it

1051
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:40,119
with it and it's it's a major issue the

1052
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,669
other thing too is you know without

1053
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,829
giving away the farm people who run you

1054
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:47,109
know in our inner domain anycast

1055
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:49,839
networks do things to specifically try

1056
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:51,640
to circumvent certain behaviors like you

1057
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,619
don't want to block whole traffic so you

1058
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,269
don't distribute things in you geez do

1059
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:57,069
you have very unique distributive

1060
00:41:55,269 --> 00:41:59,049
distribution patterns to make sure you

1061
00:41:57,069 --> 00:42:00,609
get certain key trying to block against

1062
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,950
black holing but you also want to try to

1063
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:05,319
get performance so you have to then

1064
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,968
understand not all things are equal so

1065
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:08,589
if you have a provider it has you know a

1066
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:10,119
number of any class blocks doesn't mean

1067
00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:11,710
you should expect to see the same thing

1068
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:13,180
from each one of them the answer is you

1069
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:14,320
shouldn't expect to see the same thing

1070
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,149
and if you did well

1071
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,100
they might be they might be in trouble

1072
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,200
if they have some issue on their data

1073
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,000
centers so that I think that's actually

1074
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,890
a very interesting question but I think

1075
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,360
it'd make me different for inside and SP

1076
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,770
and across in their domains because

1077
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,280
there's different behavior you see and

1078
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:31,300
that political layer issue is that is

1079
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,220
everyone's entitled to route traffic the

1080
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:36,430
way they want and they sure as heck do

1081
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:41,020
it differently at times and this idea is

1082
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:43,060
my friend so so the any cases we use a

1083
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,040
lot you know it's it's you know all of

1084
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,259
our DNS servers have any case addresses

1085
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,490
and it's an area though it does add a

1086
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,040
level of complexity to be honest with

1087
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,450
you but like it's I think the tools need

1088
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,430
to evolve one of the things that I did

1089
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,960
over the pit this past holiday is I so

1090
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,669
some of the measurement stuff that we

1091
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,620
were talking about here I updated a lot

1092
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,970
of that code to basically capture and

1093
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,009
inside the information right so like

1094
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:05,109
when I'm working with you know folks

1095
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,190
that are at your date you know a dollar

1096
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,960
sign day job right

1097
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,670
I have sufficient level of information

1098
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,500
but even with that you had like you know

1099
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:15,100
labels that come in the form of anxiety

1100
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:17,680
a not available everywhere and be it

1101
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:20,740
still is only like maybe one half of the

1102
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,690
equation to really triage and diagnose

1103
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,970
situations that are kind of cross-domain

1104
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:27,760
that have an impact on customers it's

1105
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:30,730
it's it's tough yeah and I think right

1106
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,780
now I'll say it's important and and it's

1107
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,950
important point is is making sure that

1108
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,840
we have the right tools to continue to

1109
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:37,060
go ahead and and do that without me

1110
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,970
having to actually call you specifically

1111
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,950
right we need stuff that's available

1112
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:43,149
generically right automatically so I

1113
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,439
just want to add one thing I first

1114
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,390
mentioned earlier and something that

1115
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,660
John said reminded me of it the other

1116
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,920
thing about anycast depend I think John

1117
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,359
says something very important which is

1118
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,070
get as much data as soon as you can

1119
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,160
because one of the things that changes

1120
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,990
as where you go change over time there's

1121
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,180
one very large value that changes

1122
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:02,830
latency suddenly changes drastically on

1123
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,109
you potentially and that could be by

1124
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:06,340
design and to understand you know what

1125
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,410
the limits are because suddenly

1126
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,790
something that looked close as far but

1127
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,560
is that good is that bad so I think

1128
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:12,790
getting data and be able to measure and

1129
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,350
understand it over time and trend over

1130
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:17,110
time is a very important things we've

1131
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,790
noticed when we test our own things over

1132
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,530
time you start you get a lot of

1133
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,390
different there's a lot of versions of

1134
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:26,980
good that you actually get out of that

1135
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:28,150
data line is getting longer so I'm going

1136
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,500
to keep it short from ours

1137
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:32,170
like different measurement network

1138
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,660
point-of-view anycast

1139
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:36,520
versus unicast is like v4 versus v6 we

1140
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,368
just do it and so it doesn't matter for

1141
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:43,299
us which one it is that said that's true

1142
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:45,160
for the most part but some consequences

1143
00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:47,140
we have to deal with for example we can

1144
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,930
when you want to visualize stuff then

1145
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:52,839
you cannot claim that it is in a single

1146
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:55,450
place your visualization tools have to

1147
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:57,279
have the knowledge that it might be that

1148
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:00,578
it's in multiple places at the same time

1149
00:44:57,279 --> 00:45:03,789
and it's okay if we've been doing DNS

1150
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:05,920
anycast measurements since ebook so that

1151
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:08,710
kind of stuff is nothing on the

1152
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:15,640
measurement network level it's nothing

1153
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:18,039
new all the DNS servers so basically all

1154
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:23,799
of the DNS servers that we measure they

1155
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:26,920
really do fqdn like you know any case

1156
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:29,799
test dot atlas thought right dot net

1157
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:35,170
I think it's called K dilute servers

1158
00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:43,359
mm-hm yeah that that that's what he just

1159
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:45,789
works okay Oh al Morton I've got a broad

1160
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:49,750
view of network health and I want to try

1161
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:52,349
to broaden it for everyone its hardest

1162
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:57,069
to keep track of when everything is

1163
00:45:52,349 --> 00:46:00,970
green that we've been given to monitor

1164
00:45:57,069 --> 00:46:04,180
our networks so what that usually means

1165
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:09,160
is the problem if it exists is outside

1166
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:12,069
of our operator control John touched on

1167
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:14,259
this with the DNS problem and to go and

1168
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:17,710
get some help from folks outside right

1169
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:20,200
and it's still going to be the same

1170
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:22,599
thing with our new partners the content

1171
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:26,410
distribution networks they can change

1172
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:30,789
things very quickly even during a

1173
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:35,078
session and it's got very little to do

1174
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:37,850
with performance let's say it could just

1175
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:39,680
be about price and

1176
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:41,450
it turns out there's lots of content

1177
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,790
distribution networks not just our

1178
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:49,540
friend who I asked to stay close to the

1179
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:52,009
mic Aaron so I wonder if you guys have

1180
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,259
got any experience with sort of

1181
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:57,440
partnering with the CBN's backup

1182
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:59,420
partnering with the CD ends to do this

1183
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,830
troubleshooting when it when it occurs

1184
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:07,340
and a quick note I think we can get some

1185
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:13,520
help from instrumenting the media

1186
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:16,990
players and CD and the there's many

1187
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,920
media players there's all sorts of

1188
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:21,680
things that they could tell us about

1189
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:24,770
stalling which is the most heinous thing

1190
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,460
that can happen apparently and but we

1191
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:29,380
all put up with it and and there's

1192
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,970
actually some CTA

1193
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:34,190
work in the u.s. going on to try to

1194
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:37,189
instrument that and get that get that

1195
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:40,160
part of the piece shared with all of us

1196
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:41,540
but so I'm wondering you know let me let

1197
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,279
me just turn it over now to the nails

1198
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:46,940
what were you guys doesn't see it CD

1199
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,320
ends I'm gonna give the mic to to John

1200
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,120
for an alternative answer but in the

1201
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,520
meantime I did have an idea of a draft

1202
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,569
or Ennis ID for HTTP if anyone is

1203
00:47:52,520 --> 00:48:00,200
interested you know where to find me I

1204
00:47:55,570 --> 00:48:03,350
call co-worker barons Aaron Nygren he's

1205
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:05,029
probably not here so so that I mean

1206
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,589
you're right men I mean it's true

1207
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,480
statement right but like and that's one

1208
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:09,740
of the things I mean a lot of the work

1209
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,970
that I've done over the you know

1210
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:13,459
personally over the past you know ten

1211
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:14,629
plus years you know Comcast not only

1212
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,100
yeah if I build it's a great

1213
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,390
relationship a lot of a lot of those

1214
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,860
relationships are not being really great

1215
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:19,910
friends right

1216
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,650
you know people I hold in high regard

1217
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:23,180
right so like what ends up happening is

1218
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:25,670
it's you know I let my fingers do the

1219
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:27,049
walking right and we see a problem I

1220
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,700
think of a phone call I pick up the

1221
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,440
phone and make a call but that's my

1222
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,430
point about about what I was saying that

1223
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,100
I think that Aaron and I would go back

1224
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:35,540
and forth that works great when you know

1225
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,920
something right but not everybody knows

1226
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,180
somebody man I mean steadily we have to

1227
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,480
come up with a way to make that more

1228
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:43,690
dynamic more systematic programmatic

1229
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,690
right

1230
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,579
[Music]

1231
00:48:54,170 --> 00:49:01,859
ninety-two rewind a bit to drowning in

1232
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:04,980
data you know we measure our network a

1233
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:08,520
bit I also have the measurements from

1234
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:10,230
smother Network so oh it's not long that

1235
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:14,759
the data that bothers me at all

1236
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:16,740
we've got net flow from our thousand

1237
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,859
plus routers we've got that the death

1238
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:25,709
dinner and I've got access to clusters

1239
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:30,210
with 50,000 course what's the missing is

1240
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:36,420
intuition and that's what research is

1241
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:41,609
about and we can drown and data and we

1242
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:45,660
can learn to swim on but your question

1243
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:48,630
about baseline latency performance

1244
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:54,569
across the network and changes in it etc

1245
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:59,250
I can show you another paper Thanks any

1246
00:49:54,569 --> 00:50:01,020
follow-up comments nope okay I am so I

1247
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:03,540
work for inside the Animus to dine in

1248
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,069
ale TLD operator and we had a person who

1249
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,790
dressed many casimir cause that's what

1250
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:10,349
we did to on and I we do it we have

1251
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,730
medium bunch of work in that Jenna's

1252
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:15,839
optimization got a bunch of papers out

1253
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:18,299
there working from USC yes I am but I

1254
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:20,880
would what I want to tag on any cast is

1255
00:50:18,299 --> 00:50:22,589
it like let's say if ever any cancers

1256
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,030
were well configured you have it even

1257
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:26,130
the political layer configure it very

1258
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:28,250
well but all of a sudden if your DNS

1259
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:30,480
provider and your client has a different

1260
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,950
incoming traffic pattern from different

1261
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,510
regions and so that this new client has

1262
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,730
a different catchment for them and it

1263
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,109
gets poor performs and if you share the

1264
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,000
same infrastructure through as part of

1265
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:41,160
it if you try to optimize Meo client I

1266
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,720
may try what's gonna happen make other

1267
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,308
times gonna be shift around a different

1268
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,500
data centers and then they suffer so

1269
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:48,690
they problem just gets much complex so

1270
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,520
I'm trying to say any classes that's

1271
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:52,380
what I've seen we were looking in the

1272
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:55,950
data where sacred it's way more complex

1273
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:57,420
that is yeah and the other thing

1274
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,460
depending on the size you network and

1275
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,609
how you're you know

1276
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:02,420
configured the you you may have it set

1277
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:03,980
up the right way

1278
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:06,890
on your end right you may have an

1279
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,210
intermediate network that makes the make

1280
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:10,759
some decisions that end up having

1281
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:12,349
implications for right it's kind of

1282
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,829
makes the argument for some of these you

1283
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:17,329
know background active measurements that

1284
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:19,160
are always going out and like settings I

1285
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:22,970
mean I think you're kind of reiterating

1286
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:26,690
some yeah so you're gonna add what I

1287
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:28,640
first know that yeah and maybe you know

1288
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:31,160
Robert or John Marin I agree the other

1289
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,328
thing too is this there's the I what I

1290
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,220
mention earlier which is you know you

1291
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:35,960
have things happen other people's that

1292
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:38,270
week you can't control but even down to

1293
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,740
the fundamental SP networks their

1294
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:42,380
networks operate a lot time differently

1295
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:45,140
his decision like egress and ingress in

1296
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,819
an SP network typically is not aligned

1297
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,618
right it's his asymmetric and that's

1298
00:51:46,819 --> 00:51:50,359
maybe there's some networks that are

1299
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:51,770
symmetric maybe have one transit peer

1300
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:53,630
and that is pretty ease of it a lot

1301
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,069
especially have a lot of peering or even

1302
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,869
number of transfer riders you know where

1303
00:51:55,069 --> 00:51:58,579
where what how you decide where you want

1304
00:51:56,869 --> 00:52:01,970
to send your traffic typically based on

1305
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:03,290
some economic reason doesn't match how

1306
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:04,939
it comes back to you because someone

1307
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:06,049
else decides for their economic reason

1308
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,140
they're gonna send trough in a different

1309
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:11,809
way and so now you have two different

1310
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:13,250
exotic latency paths right and I got

1311
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:14,599
there's a paper maybe on some of that

1312
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,829
but though those those change

1313
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:18,829
fundamentally and those can change

1314
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:21,109
drastically and also the the failure

1315
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:23,390
mode is different over time as well so

1316
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:24,980
what network use the hood transitory

1317
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,450
networks you may go through is not

1318
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:29,240
always constant so it doesn't always go

1319
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:30,828
from A to B the in go A to C and that

1320
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,529
would be that's a version of normal as

1321
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:34,940
well so again just to reiterate I think

1322
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:37,760
any anycast

1323
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:40,040
provides it an interesting nature which

1324
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,510
I would like to see attacked yeah and I

1325
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,859
think just my point it's like there's no

1326
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,450
one-size-fits-all way to try to optimize

1327
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:49,098
for client it might you know read the

1328
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:50,598
bad things for owners in addition to

1329
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:53,750
that any cuz it's hard

1330
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:55,400
everything is hard today it's not

1331
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,200
necessarily true that if you add the new

1332
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,559
anycast instance then things will get

1333
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,939
better right so you know intuitively you

1334
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,760
would say oh now I'm going to be closer

1335
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:07,010
to more clients in fact yeah maybe but

1336
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,440
you're attracting traffic onto already

1337
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:11,119
saturated links because VDP doesn't

1338
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,600
really care about saturation of links

1339
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,940
and all that

1340
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,730
so you know we had cases where we had to

1341
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:20,570
shoot down a cable instance because it

1342
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:22,820
made things worse and that's actually an

1343
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:25,010
interesting research area if anyone's

1344
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,860
interested I have lots of data

1345
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:30,890
kay root is constantly expanding all the

1346
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:32,810
other routes are constantly expanding is

1347
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:35,000
it all for the winner you know every

1348
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:38,210
time we add the node something changes

1349
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:47,390
if there are DNS inclined people you

1350
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:50,120
know talk to me there's a paper on Pam

1351
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,560
this year on exactly on that to compare

1352
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,049
two different routes they have different

1353
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:55,310
number of any Cass sites and I think one

1354
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,920
has I don't know which I don't remember

1355
00:53:55,310 --> 00:54:00,920
which one the one who has fewer sites

1356
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,530
performs better in the other one an L

1357
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,240
route is in like two hundred places now

1358
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:07,220
I route is expending a fruit is

1359
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,439
expanding here everyone is expanding and

1360
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:11,089
we think it's really better but you know

1361
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,440
someone might actually double-check that

1362
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:14,150
but there are two things that you can

1363
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,950
think of normal operations and what

1364
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,420
happens under a DDoS attack right this

1365
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:19,879
different scenario although this is the

1366
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:35,990
under normal condition so I don't even

1367
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:37,580
talk about okay so um Josiah I listened

1368
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:41,750
to it also started working with for

1369
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:45,049
Nikki so I've got two questions or maybe

1370
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:46,760
just a bit of background to that so my

1371
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:49,790
interest has been measuring Internet

1372
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:52,250
performance in Africa mostly and so

1373
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:54,710
working in the region way god you don't

1374
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:56,930
have that many vantage points for four

1375
00:54:54,710 --> 00:55:00,080
minutes sometimes you'd want to use

1376
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:02,750
various platforms so I've used wipe a

1377
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:06,380
truss and use Qaeda and recently has

1378
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:07,820
used speed checker so one of the

1379
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,980
frustration sometimes is when you're

1380
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:12,500
trying to make these different data sets

1381
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:15,470
you gotta fill formats and you've got to

1382
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:17,930
code number of steps to try and bring

1383
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:20,810
these datasets together so my question

1384
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:22,910
would be any efforts or do you think

1385
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,410
there's an importance to trying to come

1386
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:25,640
to a point we've got sort of a

1387
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:27,710
standardized or

1388
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:35,808
founded for Reforma so you can have some

1389
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:41,799
these different art forms in general I'm

1390
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:44,450
all for it but I'm just moderating one

1391
00:55:41,799 --> 00:55:46,490
slightly twisted answer to that is there

1392
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:50,779
is such a standard it's it's it's on the

1393
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:53,359
wire that is the standard is that the

1394
00:55:50,779 --> 00:55:55,579
best way to disseminate the data that

1395
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,690
you collect it to to users that's that's

1396
00:55:55,579 --> 00:56:01,069
that could be a different question

1397
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:03,680
I personally was very optimistic when I

1398
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:04,279
first saw that l map started up and you

1399
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,868
know there is going to be

1400
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:07,190
standardization in this space and that's

1401
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:10,630
awesome

1402
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:14,420
I don't think that the actual

1403
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:16,220
measurement results are standardized yet

1404
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,769
maybe there is more work to do yet there

1405
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:22,189
what I can say from from our perspective

1406
00:56:18,769 --> 00:56:23,328
is that if that if there is a standard

1407
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:25,309
that says this is how you should

1408
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:27,559
disseminate your treasure on your DNS

1409
00:56:25,309 --> 00:56:29,869
your pink results I would be happy to

1410
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:32,210
provide translations from what we have

1411
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:34,000
to the standard thing that's not a

1412
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:37,549
problem

1413
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,069
yeah so I think as much as it may be

1414
00:56:37,549 --> 00:56:42,769
technically true about the wire it's not

1415
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:43,759
practical though right Leslie and I have

1416
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:46,368
been talking about this for a while I

1417
00:56:43,759 --> 00:56:48,559
mean I think the idea would be perfect

1418
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:50,869
if there was like a JSON template that

1419
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:52,730
says hey if you wish to publish your

1420
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:54,680
data and you want to self publish you

1421
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:56,869
know here's the format send it here

1422
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,868
right and yeah some organization will

1423
00:56:56,869 --> 00:57:03,140
gladly digested and help summarize it

1424
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:04,849
for you right I don't think we're there

1425
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:06,140
yet I think you know maybe we should

1426
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:07,759
talk afterwards but but I think there's

1427
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,990
a number of us in the space I really

1428
00:57:07,759 --> 00:57:10,700
think that they'll be useful so so one

1429
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:15,019
thing you everything that I've done is

1430
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:21,140
is a proprietary super complex come with

1431
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:23,319
a limited format so but but you know it

1432
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:25,640
doesn't it shouldn't stay that way right

1433
00:57:23,319 --> 00:57:27,049
there should be a way for us to kind of

1434
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,490
generically represent these things so

1435
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:29,809
that you can you can just you know you

1436
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:31,220
can pass it around the people I mean I'd

1437
00:57:29,809 --> 00:57:33,259
like to be able to work with you know

1438
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,730
with Aaron I said hey man you want feet

1439
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:36,589
you know some of this measurement data

1440
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:37,880
that you know you can subscribe to so

1441
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:39,450
that you can see what's going on or even

1442
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,950
like late LinkedIn or Facebook I mean

1443
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:43,680
be pretty pretty sweet because right now

1444
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:45,270
every single consumer of that data has

1445
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,440
now have their own parsing routine to

1446
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,820
figure out like you know what does field

1447
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,380
number 12

1448
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,940
and what happens when John is prints it

1449
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,140
starts a field new field number 12 then

1450
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,510
I can go back and read to all these

1451
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,980
things that's Doc's man right yes I

1452
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:58,230
think it's it's two things it's its

1453
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,870
format in which to exchange it but it

1454
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:02,970
also has to be a rational and limited

1455
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:04,529
number or type of measurements right

1456
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:07,140
because the data doesn't mean anything

1457
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:09,540
if you don't know anything about how it

1458
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:16,890
was taken so I think yeah there's

1459
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:20,310
definitely in terms of method for

1460
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:22,200
example from aging right and speed

1461
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:24,390
checker I want to know okay this

1462
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:29,069
measurement was run from an end users

1463
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:30,629
device in a Wi-Fi network etc so so that

1464
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:38,220
when I combine these I know that these

1465
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:40,530
are oranges and also in Africa we are

1466
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,910
also having lots of Internet users that

1467
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:45,060
are accessing the internet from mobile

1468
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:48,029
devices and so so one of the challenges

1469
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:49,950
also is trying to measure much more from

1470
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:53,220
from those vantage points from the end

1471
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:53,640
users mobile devices there are quite

1472
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,609
limited

1473
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,810
choose distribution of vantage points

1474
00:58:56,610 --> 00:59:00,440
anything that speaks I don't know what

1475
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:03,330
you've got ideas we've tried to use some

1476
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,030
some to speak checker one of them very

1477
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:07,920
hard to get users to install the app on

1478
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:09,780
their on their phone because it uses

1479
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,370
data and so on I don't know if people

1480
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,500
put ideas how we'll get the point we

1481
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:19,770
have got more vantage points in the

1482
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:22,170
mobile so to share some of my so back

1483
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:23,759
when I was you know designing an Arctic

1484
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:25,230
neuron mobile network one of the

1485
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,880
challenges from an internet perspective

1486
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:28,740
is a lot mostly infrastructure is

1487
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,840
actually invisible to the Internet in a

1488
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:33,479
mobile network you pass right over it

1489
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:35,970
you know the first point of access to

1490
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:40,080
the Internet to is ik or 3gpp guys call

1491
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:42,029
it the PD n gateway is those I ran where

1492
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:44,610
most of your latency likely isn't a lot

1493
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:47,040
of your rerouting will happen and then

1494
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:48,810
to mobile core so you know one of the

1495
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,490
challenges there is to get the mobile

1496
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:52,410
riders to help provide tooling on the

1497
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:53,069
the substrate infrastructure that

1498
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:55,620
actually

1499
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:57,270
prizes most of what is the experience is

1500
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,759
once you get up to the once you get up

1501
00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:01,080
to your first gateway that you know the

1502
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,970
mobile networks think that's just a link

1503
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:06,480
right but it's not it's actually a

1504
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:09,180
complex long large network that

1505
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,860
typically has especially in earlier

1506
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,600
infrastructure is probably a significant

1507
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:15,450
amount of aggregation so there's a lot

1508
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:17,069
of back hauling and then just to throw

1509
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:18,990
one more piece in there so I think

1510
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:21,780
getting a substrate tools is important

1511
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:24,750
the other thing too is if any way to get

1512
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:28,110
some of the exchange like the GPX IPX

1513
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:30,450
net it changes to actually tool that

1514
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:31,890
part because with roaming unless you're

1515
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:33,810
doing local breakout you're actually

1516
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,920
crossing back to your home network so

1517
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:38,340
there's there's versions where

1518
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:40,620
understanding how that how that performs

1519
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:45,300
is relevant to what is an Internet

1520
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:47,730
experience that makes sense thanks and

1521
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,680
just to confirm I fully agree with also

1522
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:52,680
with the metadata argument and we're

1523
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,210
trying to do our best to do that you

1524
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,250
know every piece of result that we

1525
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:58,020
deliver has like what kind of finger I

1526
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,430
did do that and if that firmer had the

1527
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:02,370
bug you can look it up and so on and so

1528
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:05,279
forth as it has been pointed out before

1529
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:10,080
we can always do better but at least we

1530
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:12,890
try to do that as well so Brian I think

1531
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,890
you'll be our last question

1532
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:24,540
make it brief actually I think I think

1533
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,589
that that the metadata conversation kind

1534
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,970
of went the direction that I wanted to I

1535
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:29,430
think all the questions that I have are

1536
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:32,189
answered if I I could make a comment on

1537
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:34,950
that I'm actually gonna get up here and

1538
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:35,970
not abuse Robert I'm gonna praise one of

1539
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:39,419
the things at the right balance guys

1540
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:40,560
have done yeah in that so there's I mean

1541
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,600
there's a couple of definitely there's a

1542
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,100
couple of dimensions here right on how

1543
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,049
you make data available and one of the

1544
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,700
one of the really nice things about ripe

1545
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:49,770
Atlas is what's stored in the database

1546
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,480
is what came directly off the probe so

1547
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:52,650
you have you know not ground proof you

1548
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,630
don't have any problems where there's

1549
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,400
some sort of intermediate data munging

1550
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:57,420
thing that's gonna mess something up in

1551
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,550
a way that you're not going to be able

1552
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:02,250
to debug ever one of the really annoying

1553
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:03,390
things about Atlas is that the data that

1554
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:05,460
comes in the database is the stuff

1555
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,850
that's directly on the probe right so I

1556
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,560
mean there's trade-offs in the

1557
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:09,670
there's trade-offs in the space that

1558
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,980
need to be made if you talk about

1559
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:13,540
interchange and I think that you know I

1560
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,770
mean I think we know how to do a lot of

1561
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,240
these things with metadata and keep the

1562
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,410
metadata as together with the data and

1563
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,180
make sure that we don't make

1564
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:20,920
gratuitous changes to the data as its

1565
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:23,740
stored I mean we've learned how to do

1566
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:25,390
these things and and I think we keep not

1567
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:29,200
in the idea if we keep not solving that

1568
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:30,850
problem right I know I'm gonna point to

1569
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,460
some I'm gonna point to a draft that I

1570
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:35,140
haven't read but I read the I'm gonna

1571
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:36,460
put out on the spot here and point out

1572
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:39,069
that we're actually taking on the

1573
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,330
traceroute problem well we might people

1574
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:41,800
are trying to take on the tracer a

1575
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:43,480
problem again in AI ppm and we might

1576
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:47,260
actually take it on um that turns out to

1577
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:49,750
be really difficult like you know

1578
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:52,120
formats there there are an infinite

1579
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:53,140
number of possible arbitrary choices

1580
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:59,170
that you can make and how to represent

1581
01:02:53,140 --> 01:03:06,400
it's not who is and Leslie wins and

1582
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:13,090
we're all done thank you it's just large

1583
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:17,680
yeah it's there's a there's half a PhD

1584
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:19,480
in that statement but actually like

1585
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,040
getting people who've worked on

1586
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,320
measurement people of work on standards

1587
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,660
and people who actually use routing

1588
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,460
information for debugging especially

1589
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:29,710
some of the really interesting stuff

1590
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:33,330
that can happen with any cast together

1591
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:38,140
to kind of bang on that problem might be

1592
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:39,970
worth doing and everyone who's nodding

1593
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:42,460
gets to help contribute to that effort

1594
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:45,819
and I guess I have to do so as well

1595
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:47,470
because I said that it has to be done so

1596
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:49,090
one comment on that and then I have one

1597
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:50,109
question for everybody that's okay let's

1598
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:51,340
say so one of the things that we had to

1599
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:53,170
do is part of this measurement system

1600
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:54,880
that we that we augmented over that this

1601
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:57,100
past holiday is we've built like a

1602
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,600
remote trace for the mic in Denis but we

1603
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:01,450
wrote like a remote traceroute agent we

1604
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,890
had to basically hack you know I'm not

1605
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:03,730
not not that this is like rocket science

1606
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:05,770
we had race we hacked

1607
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:08,710
traceroute into a JSON format so that we

1608
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:10,630
knew what we what changed aren't they

1609
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:11,800
along the path right and we've been you

1610
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:13,510
know we all have been hacking the hell

1611
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,670
out of trace route and different ways to

1612
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:17,590
find it and manipulate it over the years

1613
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:19,880
that's just the most recent incarnation

1614
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:22,069
so I don't disagree with you I'd love to

1615
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:28,430
a pointer I think that'd be great happy

1616
01:04:22,069 --> 01:04:31,930
to take a look at it our okay yeah it

1617
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:31,930
doesn't matter whatever you get to India

1618
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:38,240
okay yeah super lovely so so happy take

1619
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:41,089
a look at it whoever yeah I think that's

1620
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:45,319
on earth that's on our on the like the

1621
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:48,500
real agenda for a ppm yeah so yeah yeah

1622
01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:50,750
yeah so okay good yeah so come to I ppm

1623
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:56,059
you'll also get to miss the wonderful

1624
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:56,839
TOS 2804 discussion okay okay thanks

1625
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,250
thank you

1626
01:04:56,839 --> 01:04:59,450
so I'm done you have a question I do

1627
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:01,700
have one other questions so everything

1628
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:03,649
that we've I think we've all talked

1629
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,779
about here I put into the category of an

1630
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:08,240
active measurement something that we run

1631
01:05:05,779 --> 01:05:10,579
some code it does some things brings

1632
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,008
back some data right so I'd like to

1633
01:05:10,579 --> 01:05:18,500
understand and I'm kind of new did to

1634
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:20,509
this group a and are W right one of the

1635
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,980
questions and then obviously this is

1636
01:05:20,509 --> 01:05:23,269
actually something that I don't have an

1637
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,069
answer to so I'm looking to you guys for

1638
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:26,569
some advice and some guidance here so

1639
01:05:25,069 --> 01:05:27,500
there there's lately there's been some

1640
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:28,279
discussions around people who say you

1641
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,589
know what you know you don't need to

1642
01:05:28,279 --> 01:05:30,920
actively measure okay so then what do

1643
01:05:30,589 --> 01:05:34,369
you do

1644
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:36,319
Rea so like Robert said something about

1645
01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:37,579
raw bits on the wire right so are there

1646
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:39,859
any is there any work being done where

1647
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:41,210
people can say hey there's this research

1648
01:05:39,859 --> 01:05:42,769
in this space where somebody says all

1649
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:45,230
they do is look at interface counters

1650
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:47,538
and the time and increment by which they

1651
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:49,880
change not an active measurement but

1652
01:05:47,539 --> 01:05:52,579
they're looking at like just you know

1653
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:55,369
raw data and making assertions about the

1654
01:05:52,579 --> 01:05:57,289
raw data so it's a step away from what I

1655
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:58,849
would call kind of a bonafide users

1656
01:05:57,289 --> 01:06:00,140
yeah user experience right like there's

1657
01:05:58,849 --> 01:06:02,299
there is no user we're just looking at

1658
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,920
white counters which is on the wire for

1659
01:06:02,299 --> 01:06:06,170
a protocol and doing you know just

1660
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,849
simple delta math between different

1661
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:10,880
points in time and there's some

1662
01:06:07,849 --> 01:06:12,200
assertions that are being made I don't I

1663
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,990
don't know if I totally agree with that

1664
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:18,339
like you can do the same thing that way

1665
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:20,450
as an active measure with you and I

1666
01:06:18,339 --> 01:06:22,640
struggle with that a little bit right so

1667
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:24,078
I like to get either a reaction Gordon

1668
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,220
Heiser is there like a research paper

1669
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:28,460
that you can point to is there I can get

1670
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:32,450
smarter on those things I think you can

1671
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:36,350
rewind to Vern Paxson's master's work

1672
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:44,600
and go forward through a whole lot of

1673
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:46,690
stuff path char from Van Brian you have

1674
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:49,730
a better memory than I do come on

1675
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:53,270
there's tons of stuff on passive

1676
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:56,380
measurement to get performance on the

1677
01:06:53,270 --> 01:07:00,520
wire and infer of the performance but

1678
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:06,590
what Vernon was doing after that

1679
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:14,330
vital signs where end-users had go ahead

1680
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:17,480
smarter on this stuff than I but Vern

1681
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:21,680
had a thing that ran on the end-users

1682
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:24,200
laptop which use passive measurement to

1683
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,330
tow the end user was the problem here

1684
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:29,600
was the problem on the wire was the

1685
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:36,650
problem the server okay there's a long

1686
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:38,690
history of passive mission you see a

1687
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:40,340
citation I can give you John is the

1688
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,200
passive and active measurement

1689
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:55,790
conference which has been running I

1690
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:56,899
think since 2002 and note the order that

1691
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:58,759
they put that in it's not going to

1692
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:01,010
active passive measurement conference

1693
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,840
it's passive active so I there's tons of

1694
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,880
good stuff in there papers over the

1695
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:07,040
years but the thing that put the kibosh

1696
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,230
on that is kind of the Snowden

1697
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:11,240
revelations you know when we were doing

1698
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:13,810
the large-scale measurement effective

1699
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:16,010
you know of access performance Elm at

1700
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:17,300
everybody said oh yeah we're not gonna

1701
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,820
be able do this passive stuff anymore

1702
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,650
nobody wants their stuff touched and we

1703
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:23,210
can't even talk about it so I mean

1704
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:24,859
there's there's gonna be some balance

1705
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:26,750
here and obviously they encrypt

1706
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:35,029
everything all the time guys are gonna

1707
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:37,250
blind us to passive yes I was gonna say

1708
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:39,349
that that question opens an entirely

1709
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:41,410
different workshop that apparently will

1710
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:44,460
take place here starting at 5:00 p.m.

1711
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:45,960
but there's no I mean yeah

1712
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:48,270
ya know it'll start upstairs at 5:00

1713
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,220
p.m. I would I would what's what's

1714
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:52,920
actually go have a beer and talk about

1715
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:54,510
this there's like also every paper our

1716
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,640
common well half the papers mark Roman

1717
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,620
wrote in the mid 90s talking about doing

1718
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,850
TCP inference and this is actually one

1719
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:01,470
of the big discussions that we're having

1720
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:05,580
with quick right right now is there are

1721
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:06,870
a lot of there are um there are people

1722
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:08,700
who build boxes that will give you this

1723
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:10,830
information off of TCP I think thousand

1724
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:14,399
eyes thousand eyes actually does this

1725
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:16,439
that Randy mentioned and when you

1726
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,250
sometimes they do it wrong right so this

1727
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:18,599
you're saying you're a little bit

1728
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:20,069
skeptical it's like you if you do the

1729
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,060
really stupid thing looking at sequence

1730
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:22,920
numbers and acknowledgment numbers

1731
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,570
you're gonna get a bad data stream it's

1732
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:27,390
gonna give you a bad estimate of what

1733
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:28,740
the but Lawson if you are a little bit

1734
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:30,270
smarter about that and you're willing to

1735
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:32,969
make deeper and deeper inferences about

1736
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:34,920
what the endpoints are doing then you

1737
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:39,810
can get better data off of that and

1738
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:41,910
we're actually looking at some work on

1739
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:43,590
how we can design that in two quick in

1740
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:44,760
such a way that you'll you won't have to

1741
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:47,370
do too much inference to make it work

1742
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:50,130
yeah so know that mention of beer so

1743
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:52,830
yeah I think it's I think it is time cuz

1744
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:56,190
my last comment I I guess I've just been

1745
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:57,480
too lazy and active seem like the you

1746
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,519
know like it was a she's lower hanging

1747
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,980
fruit but I I appreciate feedback thank

1748
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,720
you yeah so let's alright thank you to

1749
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:12,000
the panelists thank you for your

1750
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:13,140
attention so quick quick quick final

1751
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,030
word to close this

1752
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:18,180
yeah thanks all of you for attending

1753
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:19,679
things there are things to met for his

1754
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,030
support on running things in the back

1755
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,380
while making better sense of what's

1756
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:24,990
happen and the generous support from

1757
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:28,440
Isaac to our other sponsors from UK meet

1758
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:30,840
upstairs again and also to Stephanie

1759
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:33,240
from the ITF team who has been doing a

1760
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:36,270
tremendous job in getting us organized

1761
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:38,219
sometimes on short notice less than 24

1762
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:39,360
hours and yet a year so she has been

1763
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,010
awesome

1764
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:44,160
so looking forward to see you upstairs

1765
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:49,580
at the cloud 9 bar for gear and some

1766
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:49,580
more food and mobile yep thank you

1767
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:57,610
give me one naked I have these the

1768
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,610
restroom

1769
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,610
you
