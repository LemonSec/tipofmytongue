respect to IPR declaration there is

54
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:52,439
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called RFC 6701 which is</font>

55
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:55,650
sanctions available for application to

56
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,120
violators of ITF IPR policy and these

57
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,669
are some quotes from it that we'd like

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,919
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remind the audience of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impact of</font>

59
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,169
an IPR disclosure has on a smooth

60
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,209
working of the ITF is directly related

61
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:09,419
to how late in the process the

62
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,729
disclosure is made the IPR situation is

63
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:14,250
considered at key times such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> adoption</font>

of the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and during last call the</font>

slim working group will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be going to work</font>

67
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:25,229
documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> shortly and our expectation is</font>

68
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:29,370
that we will receive IPR declarations no

69
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:30,900
later than the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that last call not</font>

forming to the ITF scipy our policy

71
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,710
undermines the work of the ITF and

72
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,180
sanctions ought to be applied against

73
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,030
offenders and working group chairs are

74
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,530
empowered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take action so we'd like to</font>

75
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,849
put people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on notice that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

76

considering the application of RFC 6701

77
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,949
and we would like those disclosures to

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:57,300
be made in the timely way that we expect

79
00:04:48,949 --> 00:05:00,120

status update next slide please there

105
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:21,840
were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few comments from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

106
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:27,030
meeting that's that's resulting in a new

107
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:30,960
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> document the main comment</font>

108
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,299
that came back resulted in quite a big

109
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,388
change to the structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

110
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-language message itself and the</font>

111
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:43,270
main change now is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

112
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:50,080
part of the multilingual

113
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:52,609
layout is a single text plain part and

114
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,430
after that then you've got one or more

115
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,670
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> stash I to the 822 or message</font>

116
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:02,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">less noble language parts and they were</font>

117
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:04,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally it was stated in the document</font>

118
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could be anything you like any</font>

119
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:12,500
more tightly liked and that wasn't ideal

120
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:16,520
because each of those parts had subject

121
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:20,690
feels so the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IFC 822</font>

122
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,549
was that the legacy clients will

123
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:26,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely recognize others I don't</font>

124
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:33,380
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're talking into the mic it's</font>

125
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:38,810
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> better yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the message</font>

126
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:40,610
I've c82 to change was mainly so the

127
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,230
subject field can be picked up because

128
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,930
as a subject field in each of those

129
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:48,770
message parts the language message parts

130
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:52,940
anyway so that's now been updated on the

131
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:55,580
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the language independent</font>

132
00:07:52,940 --> 00:08:01,250
part which goes right to the end that's

133
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:02,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">also a message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> osea to to type or</font>

134
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,960
message globe or as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it matches</font>

135
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:09,530
the types or the other language parts

136
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:13,580
then that's right but with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part</font>

137
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:15,409
there isn't a subject because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

138
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:23,599
in a mentally in a language this

139
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:25,730
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonspecific and the reasoning</font>

140
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,740
reasoning behind the text plane for the

141
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:33,680
first part in multilingual preface is

142
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:36,380
that that's the reasoning for that part

143
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,978
to be them in the first place is very

144
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,470
similar to the mine preface so that it's

145
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,990
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever going to be seen by clients</font>

146
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:48,950
that they aren't compliant and don't

147
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:54,680
understand what the multilingual my

148
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:56,130
subtype is so it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be just as</font>

149
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,010
simple as possible

150
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,680
and text plain<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's a good</font>

151
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:04,830
run dirt that has tested really well in

152
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:10,620
emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been sending around next</font>

154
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,860
security considerations were

155
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:19,319
non-existent that was picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in one</font>

156
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,010
of the comments and I've now updated

157
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:28,860
that so that the main concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

158
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:32,010
raised was for spam filters that didn't

159
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,740
delve into each individual sub part of

160
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,930
the message I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure how light it is</font>

161
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:41,940
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be because that seems</font>

162
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:44,219
got a naive approach but that's now be

163
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,580
changed that's good consideration

164
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:52,710
seconds we in change that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does at</font>

165
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,270
least mention that as a risk so that was

166
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:58,530
a good commenter to get back at the end

167
00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:02,670
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> last session so as you can see that's</font>

168
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:05,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the new version is I one on the end and</font>

169
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:10,380
i've added three quite detailed examples

170
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:12,930
with the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> formatting and updated</font>

171
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:18,270
security considerations section next

172
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:21,810
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some testing</font>

173
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:24,060
with that new format it's worked pretty

174
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,939
well but I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

175
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:30,359
more testing using the examples directly

176
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,240
out of the internet draft just to be

177
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,910
absolutely sure that they they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font>

178
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,190
well so I'll send those through to the

179
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,579
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of volunteers that I asked for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

180
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:44,250
time and I'm also going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

181
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:50,910
the slimmest itself so everyone can have

182
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:52,440
some fun there was one concern still

183
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,780
that i had about these huge

184
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,090
considerations and that was that you

185
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:01,949
could potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an impersonation</font>

186
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:09,570
issue where because<font color="#CCCCCC"> each of the parts is</font>

187
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:12,190
a message i see 822 it could have from

188
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,470
fields that could potentially say

189
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:19,270
something different<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the very outer</font>

190
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:21,700
most top level from field so that's

191
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,310
something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should put in them</font>

192
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure how lightly anyone would</font>

193
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:29,140
would try to take advantage of that but

194
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,779
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want to</font>

195
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,279
highlight just to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

196
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:38,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">have had that in mind when they</font>

197
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:41,970
implemented me there was also comment

198
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,680
from last time about contacting some

199
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,870
multinational<font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> male providers</font>

200
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,010
getting them involved with doing some

201
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:53,080
preliminary testing and working towards

202
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:56,529
potential implementations i'm not sure

203
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,900
if now is the right time to actually

204
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,270
contact those people and get them

205
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:05,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved or whether it's it should be</font>

206
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:08,560
after the RFC is published and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

207
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:13,030
changes that that they recommend could

208
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,760
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied as a later version so maybe</font>

209
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:19,569
some feedback on that would be ideal and

210
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always the discussions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

211
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,530
going on this limb working group there's

212
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,870
not a lot of activity going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on I think</font>

213
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,610
we've pretty much near the end now but

214
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,470
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of thing because</font>

215
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">in wherever you are in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world you can</font>

216
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:35,260
just join in and doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be at</font>

217
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:41,290
the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> event so that's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

218
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:42,970
it for me thanks cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you Nick</font>

219
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:50,050
does anyone have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions for Nick</font>

220
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:52,150
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft or comments Brian Rosen</font>

221
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that to the last point I mean the ITF</font>

222
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,939
is you know rough consensus of running

223
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,310
code so now it's much better than later

224
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:04,330
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could get folks to participate</font>

225
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:06,489
that that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great I think you got</font>

226
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,400
the chicken and egg right which side has

227
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,650
to be running<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the other side is</font>

228
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:16,540
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to participate i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the is</font>

229
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:19,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem i personally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know some folks</font>

230
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,150
who would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this work and</font>

231
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,680
they generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

232
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,959
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure right they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

233
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,449
use the infrastructure so I think it's

234
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,330
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get people who would like to get</font>

235
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,100
this to work yeah to try it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font>

236
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:37,210
mail lists but they wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be willing</font>

237
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do it unless both the the system that</font>

238
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:44,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use to send mail and their their</font>

239
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:47,500
target mail lists recipients clients

240
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,330
could both use it and and so I think

241
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,860
that that we you know we have in order

242
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,260
to get it to work we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of work</font>

243
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,900
to do but maybe we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> all work you know</font>

244
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,990
grab the people we know and yeah see if

245
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:02,530
we can get them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to try these</font>

246
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:04,660
implementations because I I know that

247
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:08,350
there are lots of people who want this

248
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:10,930
yeah and and so it's a question of how

249
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,360
we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it deployed thank you I think</font>

250
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,089
Nathaniel and John Levine have offered

251
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,530

previous version<font color="#E5E5E5"> no technical changes</font>

272
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,140
it's nice and<font color="#CCCCCC"> short and sweet I like</font>

privacy considerations so that I try to

<font color="#E5E5E5">head off lots of nitpicky comments later</font>

302

good idea so clear your throats everyone

303

was that knickers Nick took us through

305
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,369
the multiple language content type of

306
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:13,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">for hum if you agree that this should be</font>

307
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:13,250
moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> into working group last call now</font>

308
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,339
that's it well how about humming if you

309
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:26,819
think it should not be at working group

310
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:29,850
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time yeah Wow okay learning every</font>

311
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:33,240
day<font color="#E5E5E5"> randall gallons i just had one</font>

312
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:35,639
question about moving a multi-line

313
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,830
content type into last call and that's

314
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,410
it Nick you mentioned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were you</font>

315
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,909
were growing if I understand you you

316
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,380
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were going to be making some</font>

317
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,590
changes to the security considerations

318
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,210
section so my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is based on the</font>

319
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,939
extent of those changes should we wait

320
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,920
for that with

321
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:56,800
vision and go to worse working group

322
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:58,570
last call based on that so adding items

323
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:07,450
to the security considerations in

324
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:09,399
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right so yeah I think</font>

325
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:12,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that summary is basically we'll wait</font>

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,129
we seem to resolve some issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

357
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:22,689

want to take that hungriness on the my

360

like a new revision Randall agreed to

364
00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:01,320
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes already in eight of April</font>

365
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:05,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any and we also</font>

366
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,570
concluded that the all the discussion

367
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:11,890
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Lang attribute should be</font>

368
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:20,770
deleted so can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a new version</font>

369
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:24,460
before we go into law school I gather

370
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:26,770
this is randall gallons i did take your

371
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,380
comments into consideration the revision

372
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:31,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i posted that the one that's up</font>

373
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,240
there did take into consideration your

374
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:38,049
comments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the text was</font>

375
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:41,140
either overly specific or confusing so I

376
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:44,950
I did tone down the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

377
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:47,649
previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> lang and I did make a few other</font>

378
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,929
minor changes along those areas I know

379
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:53,739
you did send another word document I've

380
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:55,240
been reviewing that but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

381
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,340
can go to working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group last call on</font>

382
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,470
this version and then if you Eddie if

383
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,299
you have additional comments you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

384
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,179
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group last call</font>

385
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:05,649
comments I mean I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to make</font>

386
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:08,950
further changes I just don't see

387
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:12,418
anything that is a that needs to be done

388
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,279
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you object but let me know</font>

389
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:16,889
cool I

390
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,529
are you that so depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how how</font>

391
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:23,789
clean we shall have the diversion before

392
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:27,629
we make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call I didn't see the</font>

393
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:31,320
changes you say you made the long

394
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:36,059
discussion about in validity of the Lang

395
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:39,149
attribute is still there for example and

396
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:41,759
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has there is still a discussion</font>

397
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:44,428
about the existing Lang attribute as

398
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,070
justification for what we're doing it's

399
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:49,019
informative it's not normative and it's

400
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,749
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the understanding that we had</font>

401
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:54,450
and I did make revisions to that in view

402
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:56,519

427
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:23,519
right and we could do it longer if

428
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:25,710
people you know it's summer so perhaps a

429
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,630
month

430
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:40,169
would be my suggestion I don't know what

431
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:43,140
others think three weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so well</font>

432
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:45,179
we'll come up with specific specifics

433
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,740
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people should send their</font>

434
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:50,070
comments to the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always do</font>

435
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,750
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will talk about whether they can</font>

436
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:54,299
submit them as issues and all of that

437
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:58,169
kind of administrivia but that's a

438
00:24:54,299 --> 00:25:00,270
general general plan yes actually

439
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:02,960
regards to this I did want to ask a

440
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:05,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">question we do need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on issues</font>

441
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,730
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to work out which is the</font>

442
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,370
best way to submit issues if you have

443
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,710
any major objections to use we have two

444
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:17,039
possible methods right now using<font color="#E5E5E5"> github</font>

445
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,990
for our issues or using the IETF tracker

446
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,690
issues tracker so if you have objections

447
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,520
to either maybe post them on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

448
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,840
let's tell us directly if you feel

449
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,510
really strongly you can go to the mic

450
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,189
but let us know directly which which is

451
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you prefer we have a github</font>

452
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:35,159
repo yeah yeah hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> we won't have</font>

453
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,830
that many issues that it actually

454
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:42,210
becomes a really important thing which

455
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:46,740
one we use but we'll see lilium cool and

456
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:50,640
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a new work ? item into that</font>

457
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,679
list also so but I guess we could

458
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,559
possibly discuss that may be out after

459
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,539
goon our slides so you're not you have

460
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">some slides that you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font>

461
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:06,149
so we'll get them up on the screen for

462
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:09,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">you and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could do them now so okay</font>

463
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:25,709
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh hold on hold up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guna</font>

464
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:27,629
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I i I'm just as just for the</font>

465
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,730
minutes I'll be confused to whether we

466
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,429
approved working group last call for the

467
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:34,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">for use cases we specifically talked</font>

468
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:37,139
about the other two draft and I don't I

469
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,299
didn't understand whether we did or yes

470
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:41,488
calling we did not<font color="#CCCCCC"> dis</font>

471
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:46,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gus that or do a hum for it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

472
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:48,779
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad question to ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok then then</font>

473
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:51,600
as a participant can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do a working</font>

474
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:53,159
group last call on use cases yeah I

475
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,719
suppose is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> author of the draft it</font>

476
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,340
feels a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little weird but it was a</font>

477
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">collection of use case like collected</font>

478
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:02,970
from other places I think I do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

479
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:05,908
edits<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do on that as so I would ask</font>

480
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the same for the same thing as Nick</font>

481
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:09,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually if I could have a look at it</font>

482
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:11,850
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next few days and move to</font>

483
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,488
working group last call on it on friday

484
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:18,139
at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the meeting I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

485
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:21,690
very happy with that as an author

486
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:23,850
Randall is that the queue I i also just

487
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,460
this is randall gallons i just had a

488
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:30,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment on moving too well on publishing</font>

489
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:32,100
the use cases because my recollection is

490
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:36,239
that at the time that we pulled the

491
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:39,988
youth cases out of the the human

492
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:44,070
language real-time draft and moved in

493
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:46,350
their own section on document my

494
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,700
understand my recollection is that we

495
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,799
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> said we weren't going to publish</font>

496
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,230
that as an RFC right that was the

497
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:54,330
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion right so that's I</font>

498
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:57,289
guess maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the first question is</font>

499
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:00,600
whether we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should reconsider that and</font>

500
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:02,158
and then you know it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

501
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,748
document that you did intend to publish

502
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,529
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd working with less call</font>

503
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:09,629
right I'm yeah actually that's a that's

504
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:11,070
a very good point and I didn't I did

505
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:13,049
imagine originally that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

506
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,519
informational and helpful to the

507
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:16,619
situation that we had at that time

508
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,210
rather than official document so if

509
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:20,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are happy with that then I'm</font>

510
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy to just clean it up and leave it</font>

511
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:25,019
as informational than that out yet

512
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,779
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well maybe maybe a</font>

513
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:29,340
the appropriate thing would be to try to

514
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:31,109
get a consensus of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group</font>

515
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:34,649
whether that is something we even want

516
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:36,840
to publish or not right because if

517
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:38,939
there's always a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work associated</font>

518
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,730
with publishing anything right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it'll</font>

519
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:49,100
take up working group time and etc so

520
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:51,080
does that make sense yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> I support</font>

521
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,539
decide first if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font>

522
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,070
that overhead because my<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding</font>

523
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,870
was at the back at the time that we

524
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,909
separated it out we weren't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

525
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,678
publish it and we somehow slipped into

526
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,630
this understanding that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would and I</font>

527
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,750
want us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just make sure we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss</font>

528
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:08,000
that explicitly right so that I guess

529
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,710
before we have that does anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

530
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,100
want to comment on whether they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

531
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:16,820
is useful or not to bring me use cases

532
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:24,730
to publication does anybody else have

533
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:28,780
any thoughts on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ryan is undecided</font>

534
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:33,200
you can give us both sides of you yeah

535
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:35,899
generat generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking I think that</font>

536
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,659
it's helpful for history to know why

537
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:41,150
things were done the way they were done

538
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:43,220
because when people come along trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

539
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,740
solve whatever problem they have they

540
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,890
need things to enter to look at to see

541
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:51,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">why it was done a particular way and use</font>

542
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,210
cases are really helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

543
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,658
understanding why things were done other

544
00:29:53,210 --> 00:30:00,880
way so on that sense I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it</font>

545
00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:05,090
published on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a</font>

546
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,320
small group with that has a limited

547
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,480
amount of energy we have two

548
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,740
particularly useful drafts that I really

549
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,020
do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm not sure</font>

550
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:16,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's worth that work Robert sparks the</font>

551
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:21,139
other graphs don't reference the use

552
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:24,020
case document correct can you hand the

553
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:27,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">other dress to a arbitrary person in the</font>

554
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:30,200
ITF say some sector or general reviewer

555
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:32,000
and have them not knowing anything about

556
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,070
the use case document at all have the

557
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,600
documents think that they would

558
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,428
understand everything understand the

559
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,629
motivation for<font color="#CCCCCC"> why things were built or</font>

560
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:40,010
do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to be</font>

561
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,350
informed by what was in a use case

562
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:46,490
document in order to be able to properly

563
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:48,020
understand the documents my personal

564
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,179
response to that and I'd certainly like

565
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,918
to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> others views is that I don't</font>

566
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:53,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to read the use case</font>

567
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,030
statement to understand the

568
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,830
applicability of<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other one I mean</font>

569
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:00,830
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can understand what it can</font>

570
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:02,178
do it might be useful to understand

571
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,780
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people might want to</font>

572
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,630
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

573
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,399
document but but not for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the not for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

574
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,040
document but certainly willing to hear

575
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,510
other people's opinion on that so with

576
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,909
what I'm hearing I would suggest that

577
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:16,550
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't publish it unless the</font>

578
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:18,170
reviewers come back and say hey what's

579
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,649
going on here and you'd have to point to

580
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:23,870
that document to explain it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

581
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:25,820
was exiting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg was starting to push</font>

582
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,919
back pretty hard against those kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

583
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:32,290
documents I'm just because the extra

584
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:36,620
work that it took that that layer um so

585
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:39,440
understand Brian's point but I it sounds

586
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:41,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me like you've actually moved the</font>

587
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:47,180
parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that that are important in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

588
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:52,100
documents or more properly less than in

589
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:54,740
there so I'd offices<font color="#CCCCCC"> Randolph gallons</font>

590
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:57,230
again for anyone who forgot I just

591
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,660
wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention that at the time that</font>

592
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,250
we did take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out I think I'm the</font>

593
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,470
understanding that we were proceeding on

594
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:07,280
back then was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would just do it</font>

595
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:09,620
as publish the use cases as a working

596
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,260
group wiki page or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group web</font>

597
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,820
page so that it was very low overhead

598
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:20,990
but it was there for anyone who wanted

599
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:24,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it Alexei Melnikov I will</font>

600
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:28,100
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> second Roberts opinion is eyes</font>

601
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:30,350
G doesn't quite like reviewing this case

602
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,740
documents unless that part of big

603
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:35,870
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger or you know a section</font>

604
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,820
in existing document because there is

605
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:41,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">alone there was a long discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I she</font>

606
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:43,939
recently about documents which are not

607
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:47,510
necessarily going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long term</font>

608
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:49,040
so but so if if you as chairs are

609
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,690
collectively the working group want to

610
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,970
argue that use case is absolutely

611
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:56,810
necessary for you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be our cart</font>

612
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:59,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">and RFC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> series then I think our I she</font>

613
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,190
can be convinced that it needs to be

614
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:04,130
published but by default the preference

615
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,110
is probably you know if you don't have

616
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:11,240
hard feelings about not publishing it

617
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:14,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">dump them yeah I think that's it so yeah</font>

618
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:18,070
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that and send the other other</font>

619
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:18,070
documents through the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

620
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:23,240
go back to it if they flag it as the

621
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,610
other documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> not indicating that</font>

622
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,159
there what or indicative of what they're

623
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,020
trying to achieve great cool thank you

624
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,210
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much for those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comments guys right</font>

625
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,860
guna you are I'm gonna just put your

626
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:40,520
slides up quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay go ahead tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

627
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:45,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">when to change slides okay and I also</font>

628
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:47,690
was in q4 commenting on the use cases it

629
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:51,380
was written as the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of working</font>

630
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:55,130
document and each use case ends with a

631
00:33:51,380 --> 00:34:01,159
comment if it's feasible with the

632
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:02,720
current wording of the draft and there

633
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:08,599
are some use cases that are not

634
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:13,099
fulfilled if this information might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

635
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:18,139
lost we could check if we can comment in

636
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:20,090
the draft itself what is not covered<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

637
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,320
some kind of scope statement or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

638
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:28,550
also agree that it is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work to</font>

639
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:32,270
publish these cases as a proper document

640
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:37,419
and we should look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for other ways to do</font>

641
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:40,040
it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just as you decided now for</font>

642
00:34:37,418 --> 00:34:43,339
can I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> jump in at one point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

643
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,649
briefly um if we publish it as a working

644
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:48,199
group web you know page on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

645
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:55,790
group website then it's not lost to

646
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:57,439
history it's all there<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm good ok let's</font>

647
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:02,990
go into the presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

648
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">real-time aspects and next I place we</font>

649
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:08,899
start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion about the line</font>

650
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:11,569
esta piedra de I wanted to just give it

651
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:18,130
an overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's happening with</font>

652
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:21,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in its place we have in the draft a</font>

653
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:24,520
chapter 5 with a long reasoning about

654
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:31,480
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdp Lang attribute</font>

655
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:34,870
and a conclusion that I see is wrong and

656
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,680
that's why I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> we shouldn't have such</font>

657
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:40,960
discussion especially if it's not needed

658
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,529
the what this discussion says is that

659
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,470
all declared languages must be used in

660
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:51,100
the session but it's much more likely

661
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:53,529
that it is meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a list for</font>

662
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:57,819
selection and negotiation and you can

663
00:35:53,530 --> 00:36:04,270
pick the language or the languages you

664
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:10,960
agree on to use and I commented on this

665
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:16,330
to a music for the RAC for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 145 66</font>

666
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:20,820
abyss in the a music group and they made

667
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:26,819
slight small changes to that document

668
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:29,020
they change the importance to preference

669
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,180
so that it's clear if you have a

670
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:34,060
preference it's quite clear that you

671
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:38,140
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a selection from it and there</font>

672
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:41,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> curl of lines added the the</font>

673
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:44,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">events during the session can influence</font>

674
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:47,050
which languages are used and the

675
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,740
participants<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not strictly bar bound</font>

676
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:53,980
to you only use it declared languages so

677
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:56,830
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you agree on is the initial</font>

678
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:59,140
languages but then you can't take

679
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:06,580
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> for what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in the</font>

680
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:11,080
session so this the basis not exactly as

681
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:15,640
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the current SDP and it's more</font>

682
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:20,830
towards interpreting as a list for

683
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:23,170
selection and however maybe more is

684
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:26,110
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really sort out how the</font>

685
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:30,760
current Lang attribute is supposed to be

686
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:34,630
used then but we shouldn't discuss this

687
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,810
further herein slim the question belongs

688
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,330
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a music and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we should anyone who is</font>

689
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:41,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">interests</font>

690
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:43,880
to have this properly settled for at

691
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:47,450
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> four the best version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of SDP</font>

692
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:51,140
should go to a music<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do it and we</font>

693
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:55,850
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not document assumptions</font>

694
00:37:51,140 --> 00:38:05,859
on this intention that may be wrong or

695
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:05,860
at least unclear and next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide please</font>

696
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:15,290
so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a comment on the SDP but</font>

697
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:19,040
now we go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> our draft and start with</font>

698
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:21,920
the issues with the current functional

699
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:28,580
scope within the current functional

700
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:35,480
scope so next slide so returning to the

701
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:39,020
Lang attribute and section<font color="#CCCCCC"> five and we</font>

702
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,840
suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we modify this drastically</font>

703
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:46,730
text we have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current Lang</font>

704
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:49,100
attribute so that is just says that Lang

705
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:52,070
cannot be used because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

706
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:54,950
support different<font color="#E5E5E5"> languages in different</font>

707
00:38:52,070 --> 00:39:01,330
directions which is a thing that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

708
00:38:54,950 --> 00:39:05,899
added and is needed for some use cases

709
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:08,540
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not and we do not need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

710
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:11,270
document any assumptions on the current

711
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:16,430
Lang attribute that may be wrong that

712
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:19,520
would cause just cause problems so the

713
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:24,819
little section here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i suggest to</font>

714
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:28,700
keep in chapter 5 to say that the RC

715
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:31,930
4566 specifies an attribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> line which</font>

716
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:34,750
appears similar to what is needed here

717
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:36,710
we need however<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detailed</font>

718
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:40,130
specification than the Lang attribute

719
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:44,120
provides we need a means to negotiate

720
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:46,010
which language is used in each direction

721
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:49,190
of the session

722
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:52,010
this difference means that the existing

723
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:56,030
Lang attribute cannot be used and we

724
00:39:52,010 --> 00:40:00,140
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define a new attribute simple</font>

725
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:12,520
and no discussion about what line

726
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:17,120
provides next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please and then I</font>

727
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:21,500
think we are still nearly as unclear as

728
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:25,490
you think some somebody thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

729
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:27,380
Lang attribute is we have current

730
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,930
wording that is fuzzy about the

731
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:34,100
intentions with both people language

732
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:37,129
attributes and we had an agreement in

733
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:43,730
April that something should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be changed</font>

734
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:48,550
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be made more clear on this do we</font>

735
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:53,330
have echo in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try to reduce</font>

736
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:59,990
strength on me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um yeah you</font>

737
00:40:53,330 --> 00:41:03,049
okay yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so some small</font>

738
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:06,500
modifications are proposed in our

739
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:10,880
chapter six dot to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just question</font>

740
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:12,860
gooner so it says is no no requirement

741
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,590
to use all specified languages but it's

742
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:17,600
not like the Lang attribute where you

743
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,640
might use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other language</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right you</font>

744
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,759
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to use</font>

745
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,200
everything you negotiate but you can't

746
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,400
can you still go and do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

747
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,509
completely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you never</font>

748
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:32,810
negotiated that's that's a tsk oh right

749
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:39,310
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a statement in a draft saying</font>

750
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:42,350
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answerer is not bound to use</font>

751
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:47,390
the languages that were specified by the

752
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:51,110
by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> offer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which I dull I think that</font>

753
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:52,259
looks strange but I haven't commented on

754
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:57,300
that

755
00:41:52,260 --> 00:42:01,610
they say this discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rather make</font>

756
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:06,960
it really clear that we don't need to

757
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:10,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk all the languages we specify that</font>

758
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:15,150
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do a selection and just limit to</font>

759
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:19,110
one language<font color="#CCCCCC"> i say that i can do swedish</font>

760
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:22,350
and english and you respond english and

761
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:24,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">then we go with that I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to use</font>

762
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:28,860
Swedish also because i originally said

763
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:31,740
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i rounded you have a quick question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

764
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,690
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to comment obviously what</font>

765
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,359
we're negotiating is a technical

766
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:43,800
capability so we're obviously not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

767
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:47,820
to be prohibiting user behavior and the

768
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:54,960
user be normal user behavior is to only

769
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:57,600
use one language and there are a couple

770
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,140
of wording where it seems that you still

771
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,140
want us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use all languages specified</font>

772
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:13,200
so this section here is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two</font>

773
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,040
attributes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> handing in sand and the</font>

774
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:25,370
other hand to indicate the language use

775
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:28,320
when sending and receiving media and we

776
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:32,250
the first proposal is to delete the

777
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:34,530
yellow part here so just starting with

778
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:39,480
sanding saying that is a center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

779
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:42,600
receive attribute and then in the

780
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,270
sentence in an offer the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> lungs and</font>

781
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,960
values constitute a list of in

782
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:52,320
preference order of the languages they

783
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,800
offer wishes to send using the media and

784
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">I suggest to change wishes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to is</font>

785
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:03,660
capable to select to change to send

786
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:06,150
and similarly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for receiving side so the</font>

787
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,960
user doesn't wish to send all the

788
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:12,750
languages he specified from the

789
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:21,800
beginning it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a list of what is</font>

790
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:27,350
capable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to select from so does that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

791
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,350
feasible to try to erase all

792
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:35,760
uncertainties about that it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

793
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:47,399
selection and negotiation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next</font>

794
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have some things not</font>

795
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:57,510
clear what we do with languages in

796
00:44:51,500 --> 00:45:00,060
multiple media if you are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 622 there</font>

797
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:02,460
is this paragraph when placing an

798
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,860
emergency call<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in any other case</font>

799
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,500
where the language cannot be assumed

800
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:10,080
from context each media stream in an

801
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,510
offer primarily intended for human

802
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:16,740
language communication should specify

803
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:23,310
one or both human blank send or receive

804
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:26,370
attributes this intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> for seems to</font>

805
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:30,960
that new user would like to use them all

806
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:33,600
but it is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> an alternative so the</font>

807
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,440
intention may not be decided until the

808
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:41,160
answer is received and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer cannot</font>

809
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:45,980
be composed if the reason for specifying

810
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:51,690
languages is not explained if it is an

811
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:55,260
alternative then on what the preference

812
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:58,710
level compared to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> language in other</font>

813
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:04,670
media<font color="#CCCCCC"> or is it a compliment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that you</font>

814
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:04,670
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to simultaneous use of the media</font>

815
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:11,770
though this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear yeah as I</font>

816
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:15,860
rounded<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that so</font>

817
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:18,680
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that i am following Gunners</font>

818
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:22,190
problem with this text the wording here

819
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:25,250
is intended to differentiate between two

820
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:27,620
broad types of media streams one type is

821
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:29,840
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using it for human</font>

822
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,790
communication in a language the other

823
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">media type is where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not going to</font>

824
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:36,140
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> background information</font>

825
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:38,240
you're not going to be talking over the

826
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:41,000
channel it's just providing audio as an

827
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,000
example or you're not going to be using

828
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,630
a video channel for sign language it's

829
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,580
merely a background for the other party

830
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to see what's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on in an</font>

831
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,259
emergency<font color="#E5E5E5"> call for example the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peace app</font>

832
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,600
that's the meaning of intended for human

833
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:58,790
language communication is to indicate

834
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,950
when you specify a language attribute

835
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:05,990
and when you don't right but and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

836
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:10,850
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to my core point which is that</font>

837
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:12,500
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of your objection to some</font>

838
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:14,000
of the material here is based on a

839
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,630
misunderstanding or at least a

840
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,220
difference in understanding between what

841
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:23,180
many of us see is the intent to the

842
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft which is to specify and to enable</font>

843
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:28,940
a technical communication and agreement

844
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:31,370
versus user level interaction we're not

845
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:34,400
trying to dictate what the users do

846
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:37,069
we're not trying to dictate what the

847
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,600
client presents to the user as having

848
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:42,820
been negotiated having been set up

849
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:46,910
that's not just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> intent of this draft</font>

850
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:51,080
yeah but what the user needs is guidance

851
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:54,529
for how to firstly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to answer the</font>

852
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:59,470
call what is most preferred by the

853
00:47:54,530 --> 00:48:03,110
caller if the gunner answering can

854
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:05,450
respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that properly then you have a</font>

855
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:06,789
good chance to start the call in a good

856
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:11,118
way

857
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:14,390
yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brock Rosen I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> repeat what</font>

858
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:17,599
randy says this is a protocol mechanism

859
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:20,200
for mechanical use it is not an

860
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,239
indication to users of how to behave

861
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:26,718
there's a fundamental difference this is

862
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:29,150
a protocol mechanism to use to direct

863
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:31,579
calls to make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how calls are</font>

864
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:34,849
routed and what is presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is not</font>

865
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:36,859
how humans are supposed to behave big

866
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:43,130
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the part that we</font>

867
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:47,328
keep running across it exactly so what

868
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:49,819
the UI does is completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of scope</font>

869
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:52,160
of this draft so as an example if you

870
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:55,640
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a UI where the user has indicated</font>

871
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,799
in preferences or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup what</font>

872
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,890
languages and media are preferred in

873
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:02,900
what order and then that you I starts a

874
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:05,509
call and uses the mechanisms in this

875
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:08,239
document to set up multiple media

876
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:11,509
streams and manages to get everything it

877
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:13,249
asks for the UI is not obligated to

878
00:49:11,509 --> 00:49:15,710
present to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> user everything the UI</font>

879
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:17,749
does whatever make sense if the UI wants

880
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,940
to then present only a subset of those

881
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:22,788
media streams to the users saying hey

882
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:25,069
you got your your preferred set up what

883
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:27,259
you exactly wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's here and you</font>

884
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:30,349
ignore the rest that's the UI decision

885
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:36,019
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed to be reflected in</font>

886
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:37,700
the protocol communication and that's

887
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:40,519
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that different from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

888
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:42,680
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room we have</font>

889
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:45,049
all these we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> video we have audio we</font>

890
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,149
have text it doesn't mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

891
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:51,349
Randall now has to be typing in the chat

892
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:53,390
room right or has to be talking you have

893
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:56,359
all those capabilities ready to user can

894
00:49:53,390 --> 00:50:00,440
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they want yeah but the</font>

895
00:49:56,359 --> 00:50:04,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">column</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the call the answer needs</font>

896
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:07,880
guidance and what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> negotiating</font>

897
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:11,869
very good guidance can be very good

898
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:15,890
guidance for how to start the call so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

899
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:18,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we I think we somewhere say that</font>

900
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:24,830
the use shall be informed

901
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:26,810
about the outcome of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the negotiation see</font>

902
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:28,970
I I feel that's out of scope of this

903
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:31,940
draft if you want to write a different

904
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:35,029
draft that is advice to the you to the

905
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:39,170
implementer of a client<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's making</font>

906
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:41,150
use of this mechanism that's fine you

907
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:43,790
can have that that would be guidance for

908
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,740
how to construct a user interface but

909
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:53,720
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the should not be in this</font>

910
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:56,120
draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's a minor result of</font>

911
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:00,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">the negotiation is to convey it to the</font>

912
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:06,440
user and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is what is needed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

913
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:07,850
complete the setup of the call all right

914
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,040
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe those are two separate things</font>

915
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:13,370
you've got the call setup and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got</font>

916
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,920
what's presented to the user well

917
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:20,210
usually you see if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video and</font>

918
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:22,790
the that's part of the users the result

919
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:26,300
of the negotiation<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup video and it's</font>

920
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:30,050
apparent in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user interface that you</font>

921
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:33,950
got video and similarly here if we agree

922
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:38,900
on one language we can display to the

923
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:42,680
user user her down with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good hint on</font>

924
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:44,630
how to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> the call yeah I actually am</font>

925
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,299
not sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true right</font>

926
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:50,900
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> negotiate audio and video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n</font>

927
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:52,370
lines but not turn on your camera right

928
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,200
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> still have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> m-line so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

929
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:59,630
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true in</font>

930
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:02,060
today's ste gunner this is Dave Crocker

931
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:04,010
I have not read the spec I have no

932
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:06,049
comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the spec I do have a comment</font>

933
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:08,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i always get up at the mic when</font>

934
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:10,700
someone says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that an ietf protocol spec</font>

935
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:14,180
should say something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about user behavior</font>

936
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:16,669
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we don't do that when we try</font>

937
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:21,950
to do it we do it badly we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

938
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:25,160
do it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't do it yeah and this</font>

939
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:28,850
doesn't say how the user shall behave it

940
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:30,339
says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the intention is guidance to</font>

941
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:33,078
the juice

942
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:38,749
so that the court can be properly

943
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:41,269
handled Brian Brian Rosen no we're not

944
00:52:38,749 --> 00:52:44,359
providing any guidance to users we're

945
00:52:41,269 --> 00:52:46,549
building protocol mechanisms the intent

946
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:49,249
of the document is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe a</font>

947
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:52,460
protocol mechanism for mechanical for

948
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:54,589
computers to do the right thing not<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

949
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:57,170
humans to do the right thing there's no

950
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:59,960
guidance to users here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't intend</font>

951
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:03,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">to inform users of what to do this is a</font>

952
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:05,920
protocol mechanism for mechanical for

953
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:08,299
computers or other physical

954
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,190
implementations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol to do</font>

955
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:12,259
the right thing with the media and

956
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:16,489
routing and all the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we</font>

957
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:18,829
do know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in the ITF Dave</font>

958
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:20,779
Crocker again I apologize I was much too

959
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:23,509
terse than what I said what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> meant was</font>

960
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:25,849
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to do with interactions</font>

961
00:53:23,509 --> 00:53:28,460
with users is part of a specialty called

962
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:31,930
user experience usability and any number

963
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:34,309
of other terms of art we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have that</font>

964
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:35,899
expertise in this community there are

965
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:38,690
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> individuals who do but the</font>

966
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:43,999
community doesn't and our specs must

967
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:46,009
stay away from that domain let me

968
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:50,569
attempt to put it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> succinctly it's</font>

969
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:53,660
a layer violation you've got the what's

970
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:56,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on between the user and the UI way</font>

971
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:58,038
way way way up above the nosebleed layer

972
00:53:56,269 --> 00:54:00,348
and you've got what's going on with the

973
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:04,069
protocol layer kind of kind of in the

974
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:09,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle that's what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here yeah</font>

975
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:12,829
but the language preferences are

976
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:15,529
definitely what the user have input

977
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:17,059
somehow and it's now conveyed to the

978
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:20,359
other side and the other side is

979
00:54:17,059 --> 00:54:24,910
responding what the other user has<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

980
00:54:20,359 --> 00:54:26,900
preferences and it's very close to user

981
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:30,020
interfacing

982
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:32,510
and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> layers that's that stuff</font>

983
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:35,630
the filters down the user has indicated

984
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:37,250
to the UI through the UI in some way

985
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:40,309
that's completely out of scope of this

986
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:43,609
document what the users preferences are

987
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:45,980
all that stuff gets into the client and

988
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:47,930
then the client uses the mechanisms here

989
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:51,410
to set up what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen and</font>

990
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:52,970
then the client informs the user in some

991
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:55,538
way that's completely out of scope of

992
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:58,640
this document as to what's happened now

993
00:54:55,539 --> 00:55:02,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very limited to really drill</font>

994
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,740
down on that this the way you get the

995
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:06,279
indication from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user of what</font>

996
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:09,709
language they want to use can be an

997
00:55:06,279 --> 00:55:11,480
explicit selection from a list or simply

998
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:15,319
what store they went to to buy this

999
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:17,510
product and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> language it comes in so</font>

1000
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:20,058
you know trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

1001
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:21,970
saying you are reflecting a user's

1002
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:25,130
preference for language communication

1003
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:32,839
anything more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has got to be</font>

1004
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:36,859
out of scope yeah so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is rather a</font>

1005
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:43,700
discussion or what what we need to

1006
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:53,799
convey in the in the protocol to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

1007
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:59,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do the right decisions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and there is</font>

1008
00:55:53,799 --> 00:56:06,319
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> say if we talk priority between</font>

1009
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:09,170
media we leave the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> result in doubt</font>

1010
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:15,190
what what shall<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use this language is</font>

1011
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:15,190
for so next slide

1012
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:33,140
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks light is enough yes it's</font>

1013
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:44,920
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have that slide for</font>

1014
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:49,960
her not good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you ah ok that's next</font>

1015
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:53,240
when reading the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at this</font>

1016
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:56,180
section about advice reversals required

1017
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:59,720
and wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that is really needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1018
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:07,970
have a notation with an asterisk that we

1019
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:13,930
can add to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a language tag and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

1020
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:19,009
it we mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the coal shall not be</font>

1021
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:23,089
the shall be connected whatever the

1022
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:25,730
result of the negotiation is and wonder

1023
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:29,869
if we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should fail calls because</font>

1024
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:37,000
of not completed negotiations on

1025
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:40,099
language it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic to ever</font>

1026
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:45,079
automatically fail calls because of non

1027
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:47,540
matching language indications mmm you

1028
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:51,099
can have combinations you<font color="#E5E5E5"> never thought</font>

1029
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:54,319
of specifying<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will work in reality</font>

1030
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:57,680
for example Norwegians can usually talk

1031
00:57:54,319 --> 00:58:00,380
with Swedes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spanish people can usually</font>

1032
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:04,669
talk with Italians and you never thought

1033
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:08,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">about saying in the setting of the phone</font>

1034
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:10,970
that yes I can receive Norwegian or

1035
00:58:08,589 --> 00:58:16,430
Italian if you are from the other

1036
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:19,368
country so ing the question yeah this is

1037
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:23,450
the brine<font color="#E5E5E5"> rosen arm there are many</font>

1038
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons in protocol mechanisms to have</font>

1039
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:30,710
that kind of alien mechanisms explicit

1040
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:34,010
failing call a great example would be

1041
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:38,030
us a sip fork you fork to four places

1042
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:39,950
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some facility that can</font>

1043
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:42,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle the specific language is you want</font>

1044
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:43,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">three of them decline the call one of</font>

1045
00:58:42,109 --> 00:58:45,230
them accepts the call and you go to take

1046
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:48,290
it the way they were one that accepts it

1047
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:51,280
you want a mechanism to to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

1048
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:54,770
say I cannot meet this specification no

1049
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:58,000
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a very useful protocol</font>

1050
00:58:54,770 --> 00:59:01,820
mechanism i would like to retain it the

1051
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">any implementation can choose not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

1052
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:07,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanism but the mechanism should</font>

1053
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:11,720
be present yeah I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> randyll yep</font>

1054
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:14,419
Drake but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and Randall has a</font>

1055
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:16,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">forum I just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reiterate that last</font>

1056
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,550
bit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian said there's nothing in</font>

1057
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:22,160
the draft that mandates failure of a

1058
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:25,849
call instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that that's in here is</font>

1059
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:28,520
talk about preference for for proceeding

1060
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:31,609
or not proceeding in the event of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1061
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,920
mismatch preference for and in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1062
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:36,529
draft explicitly says that there are

1063
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,300
cases where a call will probably never

1064
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:40,670
be failed no matter what such<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an</font>

1065
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">emergency call that's we're not trying</font>

1066
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:49,790
to force anything on<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey I think Barry</font>

1067
00:59:46,790 --> 01:00:00,170
was going to agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um cool okay go</font>

1068
00:59:49,790 --> 01:00:01,849
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yep next so next slide then a</font>

1069
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:06,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of features that are not covered</font>

1070
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:09,200
in the current draft is a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to specify</font>

1071
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:12,410
relative preference between alternative

1072
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:18,740
languages in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same direction in</font>

1073
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:21,500
different media and a way to specify

1074
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:23,868
that two or more languages in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

1075
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:28,580
direction are stronger than fraud to

1076
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:31,099
provide it together and we have

1077
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:34,690
discussed this many times before and I

1078
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:34,690
have a new thing on next slide

1079
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:50,890
and that is when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into media that</font>

1080
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:55,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">are not using any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our time types them</font>

1081
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:58,569
main types video body or text for

1082
01:00:55,030 --> 01:01:03,220
example if we go into WebRTC and use sdp

1083
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:05,560
for it we need an additional construct

1084
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:09,720
probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this draft but that's</font>

1085
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:14,049
work to be done to have a multiplexed

1086
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:20,439
data channel to be declared as used for

1087
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:22,510
text for example and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on</font>

1088
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:25,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that we can use this mechanism</font>

1089
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:31,780
also in WebRTC and other places where

1090
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:39,009
the media is not typed as video audio

1091
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:42,760
text and the there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> dsca attribute in</font>

1092
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stp neg is useful for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> WebRTC</font>

1093
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:58,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">case and next slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's it we</font>

1094
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:00,879
have a comment from Randall we go back

1095
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:10,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the first two slides because I didn't</font>

1096
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:12,040
respond to those directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think so</font>

1097
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:17,830
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we did talk about this</font>

1098
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:22,540
right i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't remember now you mean</font>

1099
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:25,990
about delete oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so is so yeah if</font>

1100
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:28,180
you if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the changes in the</font>

1101
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:29,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft if you look at what's actually in</font>

1102
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:38,770
the current version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the draft</font>

1103
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:40,900
regarding this material what's there now

1104
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:45,960
is a very small statement and then a

1105
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:47,380
parenthetical aside<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it is that the</font>

1106
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">interpretation of the</font>

1107
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:51,029
authors of the draft so I don't think

1108
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's anything in there that</font>

1109
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:58,690
constrains any future revision of the of

1110
01:02:55,630 --> 01:03:00,490
the document of the attribute at all if

1111
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:02,650
in fact if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to project what's in</font>

1112
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:04,990
the draft now I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear if</font>

1113
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:07,720
anybody feels that that should be taken

1114
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:10,390
out or<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs to be modified well I</font>

1115
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:15,598
do yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I think he's wrong and</font>

1116
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:18,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">should not comment on that okay next I</font>

1117
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:20,230
mean as I recall in previous meetings we

1118
01:03:18,609 --> 01:03:23,259
did say that was an issue for the M

1119
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:30,910
music working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group so so on what's</font>

1120
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:32,920
what's in there now says RFC 4 5 6 6

1121
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:34,899
specifies an attribute line which

1122
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,579
appears similar what is needed here<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1123
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,950
specifies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i equals line is</font>

1124
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:43,359
declarative which it does and it says

1125
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:45,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that multiple Lang media use multiple</font>

1126
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:47,619
languages and that quote the order of

1127
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:49,868
the attributes indicates the order of

1128
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:52,960
importance of the various languages in

1129
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:55,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ellipsis media close quote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1130
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,250
there's a parenthetical aside that is we

1131
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,319
meaning the<font color="#CCCCCC"> author's the draft interpret</font>

1132
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:01,509
this to mean that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media contains all</font>

1133
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:03,190
of the languages indicated blah blah

1134
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:05,349
blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example video of an interview</font>

1135
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:07,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">by a person speaking one language of a</font>

1136
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:09,130
person speaking another<font color="#E5E5E5"> or subtexts in</font>

1137
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:12,940
the language of the interviewer blah

1138
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:14,890
blah blah so the interpretation is what

1139
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:16,180
we said needed to be done by the M music

1140
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:18,578
working group not this working group

1141
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:21,490
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's not our draft so</font>

1142
01:04:18,579 --> 01:04:23,769
that's like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Joseph providing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

1143
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:25,660
at the time that this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document is</font>

1144
01:04:23,769 --> 01:04:28,269
written one that we're talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

1145
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:29,890
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the publication of the</font>

1146
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:31,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">specification of the attribute that's</font>

1147
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:36,430
there now and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just saying why we</font>

1148
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:39,880
can't use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but it's our own wrong</font>

1149
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:41,710
conclusion it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nito wrong conclusion at</font>

1150
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:44,769
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a perfectly valid conclusion</font>

1151
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:46,779
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the point is the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1152
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:48,399
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we agreed in this working group</font>

1153
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:50,740
that that decision would not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be made</font>

1154
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,119
here what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> way seeing a decision here</font>

1155
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,129
we're not trying to say what the

1156
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:57,099
language what we really mean now

1157
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:59,890
previously we had a consensus<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1158
01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:00,849
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the interpretation of 4566</font>

1159
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:02,558
would be may

1160
01:05:00,849 --> 01:05:05,769
a by the working group that owns the

1161
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:07,779
revision sure so that's so your

1162
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:11,258
assertion that bet that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

1163
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:13,210
decided that that would go there so you

1164
01:05:11,259 --> 01:05:14,680
know in arguments about interpretation

1165
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,509
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> document that's owned by another</font>

1166
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,339
working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't right the</font>

1167
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:21,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">right thing to be doing in this working</font>

1168
01:05:18,339 --> 01:05:25,739
group and I provided a simple

1169
01:05:21,069 --> 01:05:32,200
alternative to so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you still can</font>

1170
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:34,269
invent this new etiquette yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1171
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:37,328
the overall point was that that

1172
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:39,430
discussion should go to em music so

1173
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:42,789
probably having that debate here

1174
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:44,739
probably yeah yeah so in which case

1175
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:46,839
although the topic is extremely

1176
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:49,119
interesting i'm sure but there and that

1177
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:51,249
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that needs to go and we could</font>

1178
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:53,589
probably close up the debate with having

1179
01:05:51,249 --> 01:05:56,109
it yeah I'm all right I mean I think

1180
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:57,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the less said about the</font>

1181
01:05:56,109 --> 01:06:00,460
existing one the better but we do need

1182
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:02,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say something to indicate why we're</font>

1183
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:05,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">not using it and I'm not sure that</font>

1184
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:08,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">Gunnar's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Texas is necessary but perhaps</font>

1185
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:12,369
we could say even less that might be

1186
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:16,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough yeah okay so then there was</font>

1187
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:17,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">one more slide so just to reiterate what</font>

1188
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,808
Brian said we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the list to</font>

1189
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,839
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this discussion but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm interest</font>

1190
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:24,910
yeah I idea it probably would be best of

1191
01:06:22,839 --> 01:06:26,739
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I don't like cross-list posting but</font>

1192
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">um I guess I'm use it probably is the</font>

1193
01:06:26,739 --> 01:06:34,329
best place to take it to ya I mean one

1194
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:36,489
thing is I has this has all of this gone

1195
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:38,140
to em<font color="#E5E5E5"> music I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think gooner you</font>

1196
01:06:36,489 --> 01:06:40,719
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> post all of your comments there</font>

1197
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:44,200
did you no no I I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's very</font>

1198
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:47,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">smooth yeah so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really we</font>

1199
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:50,680
actually bring it there you know in in

1200
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:53,549
toto<font color="#E5E5E5"> Braun Rosen what I suggest is that</font>

1201
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:55,450
we have a discussion on list of

1202
01:06:53,549 --> 01:06:58,390
alternative<font color="#CCCCCC"> boarding to what's currently</font>

1203
01:06:55,450 --> 01:07:01,598
in the text right for ir r on our list

1204
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:04,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay when we conclude that we should</font>

1205
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:06,339
take whatever language that is and bring

1206
01:07:04,029 --> 01:07:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to em music and saying our document</font>

1207
01:07:06,339 --> 01:07:13,319
proposes to say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there any</font>

1208
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:13,319
comments and let's see what we get

1209
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:21,868
and I very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

1210
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:23,099
resolve this particular slide because

1211
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:25,650
they didn't comment on this one you

1212
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:29,519
presented it so your objection really is

1213
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:32,519
the wording where that says wishes and

1214
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:35,098
so if we change wishes to keep a built

1215
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:36,629
is capable of I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like is capable to</font>

1216
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:39,150
select<font color="#CCCCCC"> two because to me that doesn't</font>

1217
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:42,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sense but we can just change wishes</font>

1218
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:44,700
to send or wishes to use to say is

1219
01:07:42,029 --> 01:07:56,670
capable of yeah that's probably good

1220
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:58,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough great Haim thank you going on for</font>

1221
01:07:56,670 --> 01:08:04,170
that um I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> press the big red</font>

1222
01:07:58,769 --> 01:08:05,459
button again okay who knows what magic

1223
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,900
the red button does I thought it was

1224
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting rid of things than putting kids</font>

1225
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,829
always Goo Dolls also on the list so

1229
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:26,819
anything that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say more on</font>

1230
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:30,060
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that um sorry ok cool we're at</font>

1231

1232
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:35,940
into any of the business as well I'm the

1233
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">future of this working group is you know</font>

1234
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:41,189
right now to complete the two documents

1235
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:43,229
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rse process the two</font>

1236
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:45,149
documents that we have and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

1237
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:47,638
wrap the group up so I don't know if

1238
01:08:45,149 --> 01:08:49,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is any more work for us to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

1239
01:08:47,639 --> 01:08:51,600
might be a discussion for the list but

1240
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:55,198
you can feel free to come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic and</font>

1241
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,420
make a comment yes hi Tom Gallagher I

1242
01:08:55,198 --> 01:09:00,448
just wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out mentioning the</font>

1243
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:01,710
use case document from earlier there's a

1244
01:09:00,448 --> 01:09:04,379
section there about security

1245
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:06,120
considerations Nick I'm not sure if you

1246
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:08,549
were planning on incorporating those but

1247
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:10,500
if that's not going to become that's

1248
01:09:08,549 --> 01:09:12,929
like a good a final<font color="#E5E5E5"> call then that</font>

1249
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:14,939
section does seem relevant to both other

1250
01:09:12,929 --> 01:09:16,560
documents so that it would make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1251
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:19,339
one of those just so it can be part of

1252
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:22,109
the okay cool thank you for that um

1253
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:24,870
cosmid right now if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do you feel that</font>

1254
01:09:22,109 --> 01:09:27,150
the current security considerations text

1255
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:27,408
in the two documents is insufficient and

1256
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:34,098
needs

1257
01:09:27,408 --> 01:09:36,978
additional material I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1258
01:09:34,099 --> 01:09:38,929

document isn't mentioned in those other

1260
01:09:38,929 --> 01:09:44,149
two documents I don't know enough about

1261
01:09:41,238 --> 01:09:46,278
the what's in the two other documents

1262
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:47,658
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for final call as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I like</font>

1263
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:50,419
the text that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the use cases</font>

1264
01:09:47,658 --> 01:09:54,818
document and would love to see that make

1265
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:54,818
it somewhere else rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> than to go away</font>

1266
01:09:56,590 --> 01:10:02,329
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick haven't seen the security</font>

1267
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:05,558
considerations in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the use case document</font>

1268
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:08,478
yet but i will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look today and</font>

1269
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:10,459
it's very it's very short disturb it

1270
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:11,659
said if it's almost a fingerprinting

1271
01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:13,159
type of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're able to</font>

1272
01:10:11,659 --> 01:10:15,138
understand a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

1273
01:10:13,159 --> 01:10:16,728
user their preferred languages so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1274
01:10:15,139 --> 01:10:20,539
could probably guess their nationality

1275
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:25,189
that kind of thing yeah privacy related

1276
01:10:20,539 --> 01:10:27,349
issues actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do recall that one</font>

1277
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:29,749
of the the security ID actually

1278
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:33,949
mentioned that he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned about</font>

1279
01:10:29,749 --> 01:10:35,478
that text so anyway that's something to

1280
01:10:33,949 --> 01:10:38,509
