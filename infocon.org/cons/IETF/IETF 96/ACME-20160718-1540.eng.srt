80
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,400
on that yes to reasonably and personally

81
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,260
know if there's IPR covering the

82
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,419
interpretive dance and he has said he

83
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:26,810
does none next slide I think Ted already

84
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:28,669
said all these um we had a rather rushed

85
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,410
set of changes going up to the internet

86
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,030
draft deadline so I figured we'd spend

87
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,770
some time going through what we actually

88
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,450
let the changes were that went into the

89
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,890
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> in case we want to back some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

90
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,560
them out<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to make sure that we're Oh</font>

91
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,169
everyone's okay with things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that went in</font>

92
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,290
um then I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of open</font>

93
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions mix of things that are in the</font>

94
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,860
issue tracker on github and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

95
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,200
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are noted in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the document</font>

96
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of came up came to mind as we</font>

97
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,240
were making some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the changes in the</font>

98
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:59,120
industry aft and then I think the goal

99
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is to get to a lot of the list of</font>

100
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,840
kind of kind of punch list for the last

101
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,370
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we have to do to get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

102
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,020
last call because the chairs keep

103
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,450
reminding me that they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping to</font>

104
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">get a last call at this IETF and maybe</font>

105
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,570
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to slip a couple months but I</font>

106
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,150
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still the end is in sight so</font>

107
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:17,479
let's the goal this this session i think

108
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,120
is to get to what else we need to do to

109
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:23,599
consider start considering this done

110
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,630
next slide please and keep going so um

111
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,270
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> usual metric slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> copied</font>

112
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:32,030
and pasted<font color="#CCCCCC"> from github 27</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> poll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> requests</font>

113
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,289
from last time yeah there are some

114
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,728
complaining on the mailing list about

115
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the spike of activity around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft</font>

116
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">deadline and that is completely</font>

117
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:41,359
legitimate as I'll discuss later the

118
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,500
other authors and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have had some</font>

119
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,969
conversations about having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more</font>

120
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,139
rhythmic pace after

<font color="#CCCCCC">sites yeah and getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things done a</font>

122
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:52,370
little more smoothly so that's an

123
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:55,609
acknowledged problem we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try</font>

124
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">and do better next time next slide</font>

130
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,300
came along and pointed out the risk of

131
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,980
server-side request forgery who has

132
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,628

137
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:28,759
out was that the HTTP challenge type

138
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:31,670
causes the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the server to go make</font>

145
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,850
filed the issue pointed out that if

146
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,189
that's valid if that server is malicious

147
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,110
then he<font color="#E5E5E5"> can cause you can send a</font>

148
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:57,589
redirect response and if the CA follows

149
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,860
redirects then he'll go send an HTTP GET

150
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:04,309
query to that server and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

151
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,199
a server that's going to pass back some

little bit on the next slide so yeah we

227
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,579
took this resource field and change it

00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:06,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">into URL so now when the server gets</font>

they're semantically the same thing now

234
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,930
we had this big discussion I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

235
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,850
spent 20 or 30 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the last ietf</font>

236
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,050
meeting about how comparing your eyes is

237
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,000
non-trivial especially when you're

238
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,089
driving one of them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parameters</font>

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,310
you get an HTTP request so there's kind

240
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:31,260
of some weasel words in the current

241
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,630
specs saying that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to compare</font>

242
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,580
the URL parameter to the request-uri and

243
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,790
if they do not match then you consider

244
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,470
the request unauthorized um this like I

245
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">said just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weaselly and I would</font>

246
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:54,450
love suggestions for how to improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

247
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:56,969
Ted you're looking pensive Ted Hardy

248
00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:00,480
from the floor microphone um so I

249
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:02,490
believe that when we're when we

250
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,970
discussed this and and i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> my advice</font>

251
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:09,450
as an individual is that we treat the

252
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:12,420
fact that this says URL as if it said

253
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,970
fleeing right that the fact that it is

254
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could pass to a URL parser</font>

255
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:22,020
and dereference is unrelated to its role

256
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:25,200
here as a string match a string exact

257
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,550
match result right and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

258
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,430
what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically</font>

259
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:32,550
this is string exact match and the fact

260
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:35,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it happens to be a URL is unrelated</font>

261
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,979
to the processing you do on it to do

262
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,200
that matching so do not do any of the

263
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,540
more complex URL matching that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font>

264
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:47,430
do to say that these are semantically

265
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:50,910
equivalent like % encoding checks or any

266
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:56,430
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it is not string exact match</font>

267
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:58,439
you fail and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extent the</font>

268
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,199
fact that we we call it a URL parameter

269
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,230
is a necessary evil but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font>

270
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,850
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose we we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just pretend</font>

271
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,920
in our heads we called it's lean yeah

272
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I tried to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

273
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,699
second paragraph I've quoted here which

274
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,810
says if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got this in an ACME</font>

275
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,370
message if you got this out of the

276
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,819
directory or out of a location header

277
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:21,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> must use that string to facilitate</font>

278
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,930
the string matching although it sounds

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,089
kind of trying

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:46,870
because that's how HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests routing</font>

288
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,310
works but it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a label</font>

289
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,410
that the thing knows and is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

290
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:55,260
compare to this URL parameter right but

291
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:58,660
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the URI matching</font>

292
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:01,839
algorithms that are listed in 3986 it

293
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,350
basically says there's a hierarchy and

294
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,820
one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the hierarchy is to say</font>

295
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,459
whether or not it's an exact match that

296
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,459
that's doing here don't don't look at

297
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:14,410
any of that for this purpose right what

298
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:16,660
you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say is that for the</font>

299
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,920
purposes of gauging whether or not they

300
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,779
match we're going to say it's string

301
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,449
exact match otherwise we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

302
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:25,360
fail and there might be cases can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

303
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:29,110
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so there there might be</font>

304
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,459
cases where if the server compares it

305
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,440
and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> match they would have</font>

306
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:36,520
been semantically equivalent but that's

307
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:40,360
okay it's better much better in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

308
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,279
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a false negative things</font>

309
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would have been semantically equal</font>

310
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,750
than to permit cases where a those

311
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,730
positive could creep in so I I really

312
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,709
think just treated as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pake</font>

313
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,089
label for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> matching purposes the</font>

314
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,430
right whiticus let me throw one more

315
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:58,990
nuance in here so to do a string compare

316
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:00,489
you need two strings um one string is

317
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the thing that's in the URL header of</font>

318
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:07,020
the JRA jws what would you specify to be

319
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,020
the other one

320
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:19,299
it's isn't it the URL parameter right oh

321
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:22,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one of them but as you know</font>

322
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:25,270
an HTTP request doesn't come with a full

323
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,099
URL typically it comes with a hug host

324
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,929
header which may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a port attached</font>

325
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,908
and the path it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to request</font>

326
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,039
your aye and a scheme the mayor may not

327
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:35,470
be live from the transport so you're

328
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,210
suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if it's canonicalize din</font>

329
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,789
one particular server in a way that's

330
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,929
different from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way the parameter is</font>

331
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:49,629
is written that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the canonicalization</font>

332
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:51,039
might be might be generating something

333
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,289
that causes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the string exact match to</font>

334
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,750
fail because let's say the host header

335
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:57,789
emitted by one particular user agent

336
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,899
it's always uppercase because they like

337
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:04,299
that or you know decline the server

338
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:07,389
disagree on whether or not port 80 or

339
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:15,070
port 443 is included in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the URL</font>

341
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:21,789
where you say request URI in hi Jeff

<font color="#CCCCCC">Hodges where you say request URI in the</font>

00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:28,629
first paragraph do you not mean

344
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:32,709
effective request URI from the RFC 73 x

345
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:35,559
series yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that was not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the phrase</font>

346
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:38,679
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with so right it got</font>

347
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:41,320
introduced in in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> series of specs</font>

348
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great but but your question about</font>

349
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,178
is the genie can you can you just

350
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,340
offhand do an exact match between those

351
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:50,169
two things because there might be case

352
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:55,500
differences and such i think that's

353
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:55,500
still relevant yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so um so</font>

354
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so Martin Thomson I've looked at</font>

355
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular problem very very</font>

356
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:13,070
recently and it's nasty so r SE third

357
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:16,370
7230 as a section on urine normalization

358
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,830
and that talks about it makes some

359
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:21,979
recommendations about what you can do

360
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:23,809
regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent encoding case whether</font>

361
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,299
you did you realize that you can put a

362
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:30,168
hostname than a colon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a slash</font>

363
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:33,889
and leave nothing there the colon is can

364
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:37,370
be stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's how they that's how</font>

365
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,750
they work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it makes a number of</font>

366
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,928
recommendations but it doesn't go all

367
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:45,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to recommending anything that's</font>

368
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:47,480
even close to interoperable in this

369
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,570
context however you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> find that in</font>

370
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,340
most cases here you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a problem</font>

371
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,059
because the URLs are generated by the

372
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:58,340
servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right and I think what you</font>

373
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:02,149
probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say is perform some</font>

374
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,549
simple transformations and as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

375
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:06,500
possible keep the the octet that the

376
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:08,600
server sent you and then it'll probably

377
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,440
work and in situations where it doesn't

378
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:15,080
well you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to debugging I guess</font>

379
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,070
uh and there'll be a lot of well don't

380
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:22,070
do that then I involved in this which is

381
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,539
I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds terrible but I don't</font>

382
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,879
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's any better advice that</font>

383
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:29,419
I can give at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so so let me</font>

384
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,279
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I I can translate that and make</font>

385
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:35,450
sure that what I heard and what you said

386
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:38,000
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> um because your the the server</font>

387
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,360
generates the euro that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

388
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">used by the client to generate the</font>

389
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:49,459
request yes the client should use the

390
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:52,520
generated URL in as exact form as it is

391
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:56,330
possible for the clients do in emitting

392
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,668
the request back to the server if there

393
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:02,029
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> composition required because of the</font>

394
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:04,669
host header to do that it may chunk it

395
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:08,029
but it should make no other change so

396
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:11,630
that when the server gets it reassembles

397
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:12,470
it the string exact match works yeah I

398
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,419
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Soviet</font>

399

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:21,408
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that process because what's going</font>

402
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,350
to be happening here is these URLs I

403
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:26,450
believe appear in JSON that the server

404
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:30,350
generates and sends down so they there

405
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,700
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a utf-8</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding of these things</font>

406
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are present on the wire as the</font>

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:38,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">server will of us originally conceived</font>

408
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:39,830
of them so there are there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

409
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:41,149
techniques that we can use to sort of

410
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,939
minimize the chance that this is going

411
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:46,850
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get screwed up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend that</font>

412
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">you the clients use the absolute form</font>

413
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,449
but I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guarantee that</font>

414
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,970
because the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people use HTTP</font>

415
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:56,720
clients stuff gets lost in translation

416
00:21:52,970 --> 00:22:00,350
but well remember the handling of this

417
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,659
URL in the sense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> matters here is at</font>

418
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:07,428
the jws there before it gets anywhere

419
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:09,320
close to the HTTP layer right so if you

420
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:11,960
recommend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client uses the URL</font>

421
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,408
that it got from the server in<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON as</font>

422
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,590
as it as it appeared in the Jason that

423
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:22,010
it was provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that you don't use</font>

424
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:24,649
the effective request URL in any of the

425
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:27,860
jws processing I think you were sort of

426
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:30,470
sidestep the the splitting up into the

427
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,418
host header and the the the path

428
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,860
component and all those other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so</font>

429
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:35,480
essentially we're saying this is

430
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,760
supposed to be a round trip round trip

431
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,679
the bites you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the server into</font>

432
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,440
this yes this will work if you do

433
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,909
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> else Lord helping yeah I think</font>

434
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,409
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i think</font>

435
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:50,510
we figure we can say here is every

436
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:52,880
resource you might possibly send a post

437
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:56,690
to is addressed with the URL that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

438
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:00,530
got from the server right and you have

439
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:03,559
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that exact string or all bets are</font>

440
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:07,850
off yeah or you must use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight</font>

441
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:11,570
so basically take this latter paragraph

442
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:13,399
and I think what we should do is

443
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:16,668
elaborate the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of that and</font>

444
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,169
say the server must do the same that

445
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:20,809
must do the other side of that and the

446
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:23,480
server must require that clients do this

447
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:25,639
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if you want to belton</font>

448
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bryce's on this one and go any further</font>

449
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,119
about Mike

450
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:31,639
recommendations but how to construct

451
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,738
that string but I think I think what you

452
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:36,830
want to do is there's there's going to

453
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:38,570
be some information embedded in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL</font>

454
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,609
that the server will have to recover and

455
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could possibly recommend that the so</font>

456
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:44,769
but recover that information using

457
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,029
whatever method it can and then

458
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:48,679
reconstruct the string as it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

459
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:51,379
done when it sent it to the client and

460
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:55,700
hopefully that would produce the same as

461
00:23:51,379 --> 00:24:01,070
an example as an accessory yep it all

462
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:03,799
right good it's good job ITF solving

463
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:07,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutiae this is an important one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

464
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:09,168
so the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> major thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I regret</font>

465
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:10,009
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last minute here and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

466
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:12,079
have gone out for a little more

467
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:13,759
discussion but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put it out in</font>

468
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,279
a relatively concrete form for folks to

469
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,009
look at is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea of applications um</font>

470
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:21,079
so this application is the current word

471
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:22,190
I'm not super satisfied with it it was

472
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:25,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">also discussed under the name</font>

473
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,099
preconditions and I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last IETF</font>

474
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,749
and in some of the threads on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists</font>

475
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:32,359
but the idea here is to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

476
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:35,450
issuance process we have in acne a

477
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:37,820
little more flexible so we wanted to

478
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,190
support a little more variety in CA

479
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,349
issuance<font color="#E5E5E5"> flows so there's some CA</font>

480
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:44,329
issuance flows right now where your own

481
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:46,879
the client is only told what it needs to

482
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:48,889
do to get the certificate after it has

483
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:52,099
already sent in its csr to describe the

484
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:54,649
certificate at once which is not true in

485
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:56,418
the current in draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> 02 acne in draft Oh</font>

486
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:57,829
to acme there's an assumption that the

487
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,419
client if the client fills out the right

488
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,859
authorizations then he can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

489
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:03,769
the certificate without any further

490
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:04,908
question and answer so this first case

491
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,969
wouldn't be supported in the original

492
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:10,669
acne flow some cas right now also

493
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:13,039
require a reauthorization / issuance so

494
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:14,479
if you prove that you own example calm

495
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,009
when you issue one certificate you want

496
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:18,349
a second certificate with example.com

497
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:20,629
they will require you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove again</font>

498
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:22,279
that you own an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example calm and so</font>

499
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:27,199
there is a desire for some scoping to

500
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:29,239
authorizations here so there was also a

501
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,309
desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we discussed some last time</font>

502
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:33,469
Phil<font color="#E5E5E5"> raised the need for a cash box out</font>

503
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:35,479
of acne um and so there was a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

504
00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:38,359
have some requirements for issuance

505
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:39,360
other than authorization right now in

506
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:41,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> doc you</font>

507
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,409
we have a requirements framework and it

508
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:47,570
has two requirements authorization and

509
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:50,309
out of and star do do whatever else here

510
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,830
but the idea is you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original</font>

511
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:54,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">flavor of acne draft hour to flavor the</font>

512
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,129
only thing that you could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to satisfy</font>

513
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,770
the server that it should give you a

514
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,940
certificate was proved that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

515
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,889
relevant domains there were no other

516
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,890
conditions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server could impose</font>

517
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:07,320
and so yeah like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said there's a lot of</font>

518
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:10,710
assumptions that draft there to acne

519
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:13,230
made that were not or restricted from

520
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,250
addressing these use cases and i should

521
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,770
say this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the source for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

522
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,450
these use cases is kind of a loser rated

523
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,100
starting from ssl mate and looking at a

524
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,919
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other CA issuance api's but i</font>

525
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,049
think this there's a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay survey</font>

526
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,220
that covers a broad<font color="#E5E5E5"> swath of current</font>

527
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,629
practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i'll be glad if there's</font>

528
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,059
other ca's and room to tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

529
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,370
foolish full of it and these are not

530
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,320
actual requirements and we should just

531
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,899
revert everything make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot simpler</font>

532
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,730
but I get the sense that this is at

533
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,910
least the cash box one it is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

534
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:46,679
a hard requirement here so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

535
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:49,410
um let's see next slide I think yeah so

536
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:52,380
as we discussed them on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> um the</font>

537
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:55,020
big change here is in the in draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> 02</font>

538
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,910
what the client does is it shows up it

539
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,260
registers it does a bunch of

540
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,150
authorizations proves that owns a bunch

541
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,950
of domains and then it sends in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSR</font>

542
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,570
and gets a certificate and what we've

543
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:07,500
done in this is we just swap those

544
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:09,450
latter two steps so first the client

545
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,640
sends in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSR and says here's the</font>

546
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,559
certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get and then</font>

547
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,790
the server responds that and says here's

548
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,309
what you have to do to get that

549
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,570
certificate and that's like I said

550
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:20,370
there's two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can require</font>

551
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,780
inspect right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can say you have to</font>

552
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:24,330
fulfill these authorizations you have to

553
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:26,490
prove<font color="#E5E5E5"> you own these domains and there's</font>

554
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,629
an out-of-band requirement it can say

555
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go to this website and</font>

556
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow whatever the instructions aren't</font>

557
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:37,440
there um so and then once you've done

558
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,120
this um you know once you've satisfied

559
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,160
this the ca goes ahead and issues of

560
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,649
certificate um next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide I've got some</font>

561
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,440
pretty pictures so yeah this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

562
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:49,230
the old flow so client shows up makes a

563
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,050
registration does another<font color="#E5E5E5"> post is to</font>

564
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,720
create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new authorization for whatever</font>

565
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,470
the domain

566
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,030
he wants to are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looking at</font>

567
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,320
these are also on the materials page if

568
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:02,710
you want to have them close up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font>

569
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:05,379
laptop this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my kind of cartoon</font>

570
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,789
of how the process works so the client

571
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,950
says I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like authorization for</font>

572
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:10,629
example.com server creates a challenge

573
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:13,360
to say here's how you can prove

574
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:16,210
example.com the client sets everything

575
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,340
up and says okay I'm ready um green I'm

576
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,990
representing<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray on the left I mean</font>

577
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,428
representing these pending States says

578
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,130
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server's issued it but it doesn't</font>

579
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:26,110
know if it's valid or not once the

580
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,880
client responds to the challenge the

581
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,740
cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server goes often validates it</font>

582
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,600
which is not shown here but once it's

583
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,450
validated it turns the the challenge

584
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">green says the challenge is good notify</font>

585
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:39,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">at that point once the the the challenge</font>

586
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,530
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been completed the authorization is</font>

587
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:43,149
good the client pulls the co that

588
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,289
happens and once the authorization is

589
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,630
good the client can send a new

590
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,340
certificate request this should<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

591
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,500
pretty familiar if you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the old</font>

592
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,270
spec this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of a graph so we</font>

593
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:57,400
can compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the new stuff any</font>

594
00:28:52,270 --> 00:29:00,190
questions about this clarifications well

595
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,020
yeah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's intended to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> illustrate</font>

596
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:07,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">information flow as opposed to request</font>

597
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:09,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">response flow yeah next slide please so</font>

598
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,740
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the flow we have in the current</font>

599
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,980
draft on so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see there is another</font>

600
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:17,620
layer compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the last one um that's</font>

601
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,409
just less slide layout but the idea here

602
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,639
is you show up you register and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

603
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:24,250
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending a new authorization</font>

604
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,260
request you send in an application for a

605
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,059
certificate that was the the word I

606
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,549
picked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ether not totally</font>

607
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:32,620
satisfied if if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better word</font>

608
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:34,840
I'd love to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but the app what the</font>

609
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,010
application says is it's basically the

610
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,470
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was in the new</font>

611
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,450
certificate message before it's a CSR

612
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:45,190
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> before not after dates i would</font>

613
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:52,750
like it's an application for a search it

614
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:57,280
go ahead so say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a system where I</font>

615
00:29:52,750 --> 00:30:02,350
have a separation<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the origin</font>

616
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:05,610
servers which are on Gator certificates

617
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:10,980
and the authorization system which is

618
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:12,360
proving them and now in the current

619
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,429
design as I understand it that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

620
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to make a dummy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CSR which I</font>

621
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:20,429
actually wish not to be fulfilled<font color="#E5E5E5"> in or</font>

622
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:23,220
determine the conditions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal</font>

623
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:24,660
conditions so I can't stand up purely my

624
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,040
authority my authorization system

625
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,420
without standing up one of the instances

626
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,500
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> which actually will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

627
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:33,299
will be that will be the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

628
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:35,370
identities correct that is correct in

629
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,260
this system you cannot obtain

630
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:49,590
authorization without also obtaining

631
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:51,870
certificate yeah yes it's lame I think I

632
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,250
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said so which is that it means I</font>

633
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,949
cannot build a separated system without

634
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:59,970
having a dummy<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSR that I wish not to be</font>

635
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:02,220
authorized so I know I know I've got a

636
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:04,620
thousand a thousand minions<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want i had</font>

637
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,910
a thousand domain names that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wish to</font>

638
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,678
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to issue certificates for and</font>

639
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,960
then i'm going to spin up a variety web

640
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,000
servers which will then go progressive

641
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,400
certificates or not and i'm going to

642
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:22,830
authorize them now<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all to be spun</font>

643
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:25,320
up before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can do anything Thompson so</font>

644
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,590
I'm wondering does is the is the

645
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:31,740
authorization strictly subject to the

646
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:34,590
application is it is it in time entirely

647
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:38,280
owned by or will they exist independent

648
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:40,590
of so in the currents back it's there is

649
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,360
an option for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ca to scope the</font>

650
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,260
authorization to the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

651
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,540
registrations it's goat the

652
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,700
authorization to the application right

653
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,500
because i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Eckerd's concern</font>

654
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,750
might be addressed by using the dummy

655
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,340
csr in that case and you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

656
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,750
throw away the private care no I want it

657
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,250
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's just stupid I don't want</font>

658
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,290
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be I don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see us are all</font>

659
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,910
right so like you could monkey patch

660
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:01,860
this by just having a flag in the

661
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,540
request that says I'm just doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this to</font>

662
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,479
see the requirements don't actually

663
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,428
issue the certificate now he won that he

664
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,740
wants the authorization authorization to

665
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:14,160
be fulfilled<font color="#CCCCCC"> and oh yeah usable for the</font>

666
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,720
later thing the question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

667
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,640
reuse the authorization for something

668
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,170
else I mean yeah I mean yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

669
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,930
so they gave me up to see his policy of

670
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:24,310
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course again I question either</font>

671
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,690
to the point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this I point my</font>

672
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,220
party authorization I put is the only

673
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,690
the useless in my desk where the

674
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,460
authorizations are only good finest in

675
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,350
but my point is the only actual working

676
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,570
at BCA does not have the policy you're

677
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:38,320
suggesting and so it is extraordinarily

678
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:39,399
silly to design the system I understand

679
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,679
understand what you're saying is let's

680
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,060
design<font color="#CCCCCC"> from Egyptian policy but that</font>

681
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,370
restrictive policy imposes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mullane</font>

682
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:51,669
conditions on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the on the customer</font>

683
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:53,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">um so so we there was a brief exchange</font>

684
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,450
on the list about should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we keep around</font>

685
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,010
new authorization because you could

686
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:59,320
design<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can sign a flow we're like</font>

687
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,820
in if you author if you offer a new

688
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,399
authorization<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint in the directory</font>

689
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,020
that's a ca's way of saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> i support</font>

690
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,060
generic authorizations you can come here

691
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,610
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre-authorized and we can do the</font>

692
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,320
tradition of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> acme dance you know and</font>

693
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">love and then you can come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> along to this</font>

694
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,540
application thing and all the things

695
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">will just pop in there you'll be good to</font>

696
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,430
go you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

697
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,020
authorizations um feedback on the list

698
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,100
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point was if we're going to do</font>

699
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,379
this let's go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kill a new</font>

700
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,510
authorization but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's</font>

701
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,430
an important use case<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

702
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:30,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunate on it seems to me is it like</font>

703
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,990
on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the operating</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">conditions that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought that i use for</font>

705
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,890
my the operating conditions that i use

706
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,560
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys that i actually do</font>

707
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,360
terminate but actually actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you</font>

708
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,649
know wish to certify for may be totally

709
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,120
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that key for the keys</font>

710

that i wish that i wish to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

711
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,050
authorizing let me give you a concrete

712
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:50,920
example say<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that what I wish to do</font>

713
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:53,409
is I wish to issue on Ed 2551

714
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:56,140
certificates of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> edu 5519</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

716
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,830
aggressively say I wish to issue a

difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> and certificate with x2 5519</font>

718
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,510
in the terminal identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so now</font>

719
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,370
what I'm going to do is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

720
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:09,040
NASA and but on their hand that's like

721
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:10,630
in my web server somewhere and my box my

722
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,940
pocket is a registration has it never

723
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:15,159
heard of actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5509</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's doing PG</font>

724
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,418
sex so now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do is I'm</font>

725
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,040
gonna make a fake certificate which

726
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:19,810
contains some sort of some sort of

727
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,630
laying key which can no use to anybody

728
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:24,100
which I wish not to be at valid so this

729
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,620
probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually all</font>

730
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,049
that meaningful because either way like

731
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:32,319
whichever order you wish send the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSR n</font>

732
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,620
like the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cert</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> management box has to</font>

733
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,270
get us

734
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,040
csr from the box that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the real key</font>

735
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:39,659
at some point you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's do it</font>

736
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:42,759
up front instead of when you yeah but I

737
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,739
see my point is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we might but</font>

738
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,360
my point is you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh it doesn't matter</font>

739
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:47,889
why not you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a dummy certificate and</font>

740
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,170
not worry about it and what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font>

741
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:51,100
is what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is that there may be</font>

742
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,030
conditions where the stories have

743
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,529
complete different character isn't

744
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:56,110
eventually which the issue because my

745
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:57,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">sis are not compatible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um so yeah I do</font>

746
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,260
that you think is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think that</font>

747
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,640
like that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like not an opportune</font>

748
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:07,030
time to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> take out something which is</font>

749
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:09,490
like a basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> use case um um perforations</font>

750
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:11,440
busy basically an aesthetic argument

751
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:15,609
about about about keeping everything in

752
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,320
one flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't that much let me ask the</font>

753
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,570
question that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was asked before which I</font>

754
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,090
didn't hear you answer which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if the</font>

755
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,400
new applications flow is restored so

756
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:27,280
that both this new flow and the original

757
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">flow are supported do you have a problem</font>

758
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,830
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what is that problem I think</font>

759
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,060
that'd be fine mark I did it wouldn't be

760
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,500
the original flower we would still have

761
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,690
an application<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to get it to a</font>

762
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,950
certificate is yes all transactions

763
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,300
would but it would restore new

764
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,640
applications in order to get the

765
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:49,300
ordering a tea you either<font color="#E5E5E5"> I store a new</font>

766
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:50,740
authorization yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so in in the</font>

767
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:56,290
room will clearly have to take this to

768
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:57,790
the list for for confirmation but in the

769
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:02,050
room is there anybody who objects to

770
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:03,190
having both flows supported and if so

771
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:08,770
could you come to the microphone and

772
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:10,420
tell us why<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we'll take</font>

773
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,240
question to the list to confirm that

774
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,280
restoring the were having both flows

775
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,770
supported isn't an issue for anybody

776
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,620
else but for the moment let's write that

777
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,780
down is the tentative resolution and

778
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:26,560
move on yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that that makes</font>

779
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:28,150
sense um I think I would probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font>

780
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,549
that since we have the scoping

781
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,170
requirement around now I would probably

782
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:34,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">require that authorizations created</font>

783
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:37,840
through that magazine be unscathed what

784
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,280
would you scope them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font>

785
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,810
sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so that's that's the</font>

786
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,290
overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the applications mechanism</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

787
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:47,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">think next slide just has a couple of</font>

788
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:51,610
little considerations um smaller than

789
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:53,020
one ever raised yeah this looks mostly

790
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,000
the same from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

791
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,700
point of view server s do a little bit

792
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,210
more state tracking but it's a pretty

793
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:04,660
minor but like I class bullet says this

794
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:09,340
is very much a first cut very<font color="#E5E5E5"> open to</font>

795
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:10,899
suggestions comments yeah there's and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

796
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,520
highlighted some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this back or some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

797
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,660
the next section<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I think</font>

798
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:18,190
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for current spec any other</font>

799
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:21,759
notes people have thoughts and what's

800
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:25,300
what went in and 03 again apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

801
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,860
the late rush at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> deadline I hope the</font>

802
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,080
two weeks between then and now have been

803
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,570
useful effects to catch up on what's

804
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,630
inspect all right so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some issues</font>

805
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:37,000
in the issue tracker and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc once</font>

806
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:39,130
you call these out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if folks have</font>

807
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,100
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts so one thing someone had</font>

808
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:44,020
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for is some explicit indication of</font>

809
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,240
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Acme version in the protocol so</font>

810
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,890
right now we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that there's no</font>

811
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,450
place in the protocol where the server

812
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,830
says this is the acne version<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

813
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:55,899
supported the client says this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

814
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:57,640
version I support um the issue other guy

815
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,530
filed the issue said that you could put

816
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,270
this in directory in a metal container

817
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:05,650
we have or the server can<font color="#E5E5E5"> state meta</font>

818
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:07,690
data about its acne service in thinking

819
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though occurs to</font>

820
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,260
me there might be some subtleties here

821
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,610
given the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of decoupled way this</font>

822
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,710
thing is designed so you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

823
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:17,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">registration an account you created with</font>

824
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:19,450
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> v1 with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see a high of the v1</font>

825
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,920
protocol and maybe the server is

826
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,720
upgraded to v2 and

827
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,940
has is willing to persist those

828
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,330
registrations and so there's some v1

829
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,770
stuff that persists into v2 maybe this

830
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,380
isn't an issue it just sort of seemed

831
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:33,670
like there might be some<font color="#CCCCCC"> subtlety here</font>

832
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,240
anyone have preferences on stating

833
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,860
versions right now you can state it by

834
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,890
using different<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs perversion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as is</font>

835
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,300
commonly done with web api is so maybe

836
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,080
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a neat here at all Phil I</font>

837
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:48,310
totally want the version to be in band

838
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,759
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway can be</font>

839
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:53,799
authenticated since we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

840
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,320
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff yes you're doing it</font>

841
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,150
over HTTP today but you know we might

842
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do it over different protocols</font>

843
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:03,370
HTTP is probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

844
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:07,029
forever I<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly don't want to have</font>

845
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:10,240
the fewer connections that there are two

846
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:13,090
the acne stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what it's riding on</font>

847
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,669
the better so yes always<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the version</font>

848
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,770
number in band it's just not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a close</font>

849
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:20,200
call so Phil do you think that we should

850
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,880
then put the Creator version number and

851
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:26,640
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it inside of the authenticated</font>

852
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:29,410
envelope interesting proposal yeah

853
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">martin thomson d the thing that worries</font>

854
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">me in that regard and I think Phil's</font>

855
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,080
comment sort of highlights that is if we

856
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,720
make changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol that have</font>

857
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:44,580
subtle implications on the semantics of

858
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,740
various fields that are under protection

859
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:50,740
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this problem where things that</font>

860
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">were signed in one context can be used</font>

861
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,100
in another context and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

862
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:56,080
about the way that they interact with

863
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">each other in nasty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways and if there's</font>

864
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:02,250
an explicit version it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be a</font>

865
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:05,950
string saying this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Acme right um then</font>

866
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:09,190
we're done<font color="#CCCCCC"> right you just check that</font>

867
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:12,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's the same it's not the same buff</font>

868
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:14,650
very simple thing and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is a</font>

869
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:18,370
reasonable is rid of it and the key here

870
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:20,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">is we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it I much</font>

871
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:22,660
prefer things that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

872
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,400
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and we put this thing in now</font>

873
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:31,410
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't end up having a three-year</font>

874
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,410
truck how do we do move to version next

875
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,780
so Martin Thompson again that the the

876
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,550
thing that we're doing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest 13</font>

877
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:43,240
years where prefix prefixing everything

878
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:45,940
that we sign with TLS 13 and some other

879
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,879
information typically this basically

880
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:51,280
does the same thing because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

881
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:56,700
JW WS and you just have to include it

882
00:40:51,280 --> 00:41:02,109
somewhere so that would address the

883
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:05,410
posts bodies sent by the client but not

884
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:06,880
anything sent by the server unless we

885
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:08,940
were to add a field to all the server

886
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,170
responses and says this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the version</font>

887
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:14,589
and then it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be authenticated by</font>

888
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:16,750
HTTPS yeah suspect that is probably okay

889
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:18,040
because the the general model that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

890
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">operating on is that the client</font>

891
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,930
authenticates<font color="#E5E5E5"> its its information by</font>

892
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:25,330
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Java WS and signing things and</font>

893
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:29,410
the server authenticates<font color="#E5E5E5"> its its</font>

894
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:30,848
responses by putting them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in HTTPS so do</font>

895
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:34,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think we should also have a certain</font>

896
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:36,520
server sent version number why not where

897
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,230
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> together sighs you just make it</font>

898
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it completely symmetric to say</font>

899
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:43,690
every single every single object that we

900
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,390
generate used to have a type on

901
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:50,349
everything right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was on</font>

902
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:51,910
everything but I'm sure you know wasn't

903
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:53,740
that there was a challenge as I'll have

904
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:56,109
a tight requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it tight</font>

905
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:58,200
yeah but then we was mainly focused

906
00:41:56,109 --> 00:42:02,259
including the URI because that was

907
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:05,470
considered more precise but now there's

908
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:07,119
this idea that well it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a UI what</font>

909
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:10,930
does it actually mean it doesn't carry

910
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:13,450
any I can't check that now so I think

911
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that yeah you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might as well as that's</font>

912
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:19,480
still focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or server</font>

913
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and yeah um all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right we can take this</font>

914
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,690
to figure out exactly what the semantics

915
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,130
are you can around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit but I</font>

916
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,839
think there's something that yeah so it

917
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,930
sounds like clients a server the thing

918
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:31,089
to have is a new thing in the jws

919
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,129
protected header is it that's your

920
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:36,009
version and then maybe something in the

921
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:38,200
server side<font color="#CCCCCC"> dan Daniel can't go more so</font>

922
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:39,550
um I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to point out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

923
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,129
doesn't mean we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

924
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:44,500
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at all right we and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

925
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,490
get upgrades for free just by having the

926
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,690
version number indicated

927
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:48,790
right if we have the version number what

928
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,680
we're doing basically is saying as soon

929
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:53,100
as we change the version number all of

930
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:58,270
the old clients are going to fail

931
00:42:53,100 --> 00:43:00,790
explicitly yes so just this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

932
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:05,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">why is concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about wanting to bring</font>

933
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:09,060
some old clients along but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately I</font>

934
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:11,650
think maybe fast failure might be better

935
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">something's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about some on Thompson we</font>

936
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:15,790
can decide not to change the version

937
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:18,009
number and add things oh yeah sure right

938
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:22,090
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that option but then we</font>

939
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:24,220
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about it yeah there</font>

940
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">is no escaping thinking about it let's</font>

941
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:30,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">just I think we all agree there's no</font>

942
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:35,980
escaping thinking really I guess that's

943
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're paid to do remind me to stop</font>

944
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:42,910
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS all right I think think we're</font>

945
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,580
good on that um so right now this one is

946
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,170
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty simple um if you create a</font>

947
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:49,330
registration with one account key and

948
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you try and create you send another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

949
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,779
registration account the same account

950
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:55,990
key there's a requirement the server

951
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:58,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">return of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 409 conflict response along</font>

952
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:01,750
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pointer to the existing one so</font>

953
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:03,280
the the file<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the issue pointed out</font>

954
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,780
that this is way too harsh it's not

955
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,970
doesn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an error you should</font>

956
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:10,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">just return success and say you you</font>

957
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:13,810
found the one that is is the real thing

958
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:15,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and provide the URL there Martin it</font>

959
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:18,730
looks like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having some feeling</font>

960
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:26,260
here maybe a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 response would be more</font>

961
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:29,650
semantically clear yeah that oh well

962
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:35,560
Thompson<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggests 302 found which seems</font>

963
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:37,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um it might be slightly</font>

964
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,369
non-trivial for clients that are just

965
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,560
transparently handle you know where the

966
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:46,740
HTTP layer transparently handles

967
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:49,330
redirects you might not get the URL out

968
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:53,470
easily but I think we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some ways</font>

969
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:58,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack around them so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come on Tom</font>

970
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:59,379
sedate you are returning a 201 in the

971
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,029
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you've created</font>

972
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:04,059
new resource right right so the two it

973
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:06,940
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a location header exactly and the</font>

974
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:08,319
302 will have a location header with the

975
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,930
same information in it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

976
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:13,509
ignore what the status code is you get

977
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:15,940
the same result in principle but I think

978
00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:18,819
in practice some HTTP libraries treats

979
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:25,440
300 series from differently from 200

980
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">right I not usually automatically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

981
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:31,359
mmm yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's right XH on Mike</font>

982
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">too but yeah well I think you could</font>

983
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,538
solve it anyway by having whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

984
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:40,599
final responses also include the

985
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:45,190
location header is that two suspects mr.

986
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:49,500
HTTP ok alright we can hack around the

987
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:52,029
Sun ok so what the minutes reflect 302

988
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:57,549
maybe we can crash the note server by

989
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:59,650
sending it into some redirect loop all

990
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:01,869
right um<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is another kind of</font>

991
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:03,339
simple to conceptualize one right now we

992
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:05,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">have two out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of band things and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

993
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:07,240
question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> should we have one we have</font>

994
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:09,339
an out-of-band requirement in the

995
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,959
application flow where the server can

996
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:12,819
say it before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will issue a certificate</font>

997
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,490
at all you have to go do this thing like

998
00:46:12,819 --> 00:46:16,569
the payment thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just a URL you go</font>

999
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,640
to a website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do whatever it says</font>

1000
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:20,019
there we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a similar thing at</font>

1001
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,839
the challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> level which was added I</font>

1002
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:24,519
think in the last IETF cycle which says

1003
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:26,589
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of doing one of the</font>

1004
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:28,450
predefined challenges like HTTP or DNS

1005
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:29,799
or TLS<font color="#E5E5E5"> S&I you have to do this other</font>

1006
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:32,288
thing before I will consider you

1007
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:34,329
authorized for this identifier so the

1008
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:36,190
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just in what the</font>

1009
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:37,990
out-of-band thing is gating whether it's

1010
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:39,130
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorization or whether it's</font>

1011
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:43,479
getting issuance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the certificate</font>

1012
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:44,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">overall um question is should we kill</font>

1013
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,730
one of these and just have one out of

1014
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:50,380
band thing I the argument for dropping

1015
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,779
one is sort of why I have two out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1016
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,250
band we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need them both the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> argument for</font>

1017
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:56,589
keeping them<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

1018
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:59,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">could imagine a CA that um you know</font>

1019
00:46:56,589 --> 00:47:01,720
migrated most of its flow over to acme

1020
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:04,359
and just couldn't migrate its validation

1021
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:07,419
system I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it would like to use</font>

1022
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:09,788
all of acne state tracking and issuance

1023
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,799
flow on that but it can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it</font>

1024
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:13,400
needs some you know specially crafted

1025
00:47:11,799 --> 00:47:15,470
email base

1026
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:18,170
you know phase of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moon based domain</font>

1027
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:22,100
validation and it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the</font>

1028
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:27,230
out-of-bounds stuff for that anyone has

1029
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:30,740
strong preferences here not seeing a lot

1030
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:33,680
of action here so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my suggestion</font>

1031
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:35,390
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> i kind of have sympathy with</font>

1032
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,250
the only do one<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of band thing here</font>

1033
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,990
so unless there's objections<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1034
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:40,520
don't think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of the</font>

1035
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:42,770
requirement one because that stills cash

1036
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:45,170
box but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get rid of the</font>

1037
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:47,920
challenge one um<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's at a</font>

1038
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,910
finer level of granularity so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1039
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,920
unless there's objections i think i'll

1040
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:55,069
go ahead with taking out the out-of-band

1041
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,630
challenge are their objections please

1042
00:47:55,070 --> 00:48:00,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">come to the mic now if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1043
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:01,790
room right<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll confirm on the list</font>

1044
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:05,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like there are no objections</font>

1045
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:07,940
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mountain tops are just on</font>

1046
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:11,210
on the last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did some checking it</font>

1047
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:14,630
is possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to suppress the following of</font>

1048
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:17,510
redirects on fetch<font color="#CCCCCC"> info chicken yeah i</font>

1049
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:21,560
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about xhr because i work off</font>

1050
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:23,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">on that one now yeah the other thing I</font>

1051
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,160
would observe<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is that if it turns</font>

1052
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,330
out in some future scenario we need the

1053
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,560
out-of-band challenge thing the

1054
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,299
challenge space is designed to be

1055
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,680
extensible so it's trivial to add it

1056
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,890
back we don't need to bump the version

1057
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,589
number we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just add that again</font>

1058
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:39,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so resolved pending list</font>

1059
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:41,060
confirmation<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was is</font>

1060
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:42,259
slightly more<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical and it goes back</font>

1061
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question we were discussing</font>

1062
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:46,820
earlier about how do you roll from one

1063
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:49,190
account key to another we this is like

1064
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,900
iteration number three or four of the

1065
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:53,450
signing<font color="#E5E5E5"> structures so we did one that</font>

1066
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:56,530
Karthik didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we swapped the</font>

1067
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:59,299
order of signatures and that and then

1068
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:01,250
Jacob came along and came along came up

1069
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,470
with this parallel signature thing we we

1070
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:06,710
fixed with having both the new key and

1071
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:08,209
the old key so right now on the

1072
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:10,640
structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you signs it's a change from</font>

1073
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:12,320
an old key to a new key is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

1074
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,620
this message that has both keys in it

1075
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:18,790
both public keys and then you sign with

1076
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:21,529
both private keys on so that both keys

1077
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,940
agree to the changeover that would that

1078
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,770
was sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the critical property that</font>

1079
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:27,109
that we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get out of this this</font>

1080
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:33,049
message is the son of both keys

1081
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:34,759
the hand over the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> in practice with</font>

1082
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:37,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">this parallel signature thing is that it</font>

1083
00:49:34,759 --> 00:49:39,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">requires a multi signature jws which a</font>

1084
00:49:37,549 --> 00:49:41,509
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> libraries</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jws libraries that are</font>

1085
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:44,660
out there don't support and if you're

1086
00:49:41,509 --> 00:49:47,989
doing a I was doing some implementation

1087
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:49,759
works after publishing drafts if you you

1088
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:51,079
can imagine building a nice transport

1089
00:49:49,759 --> 00:49:53,869
layer for your acne server where it

1090
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:55,549
validates one signature for post and

1091
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:57,950
reports up what<font color="#E5E5E5"> key it did that</font>

1092
00:49:55,549 --> 00:49:59,900
validation with to the acne layer this

1093
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:02,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">breaks that pattern of every post being</font>

1094
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,920
signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a single key and has multiple</font>

1095
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:06,559
keys and so it's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> awkward</font>

1096
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,660
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that design architecture aesthetic</font>

1097
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,299
point of view so the proposal here is

1098
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,399
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to serialize the signatures to make</font>

1099
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:19,670
the signatures go in sequence instead of

1100
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:20,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">in parallel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm having a flashback to</font>

1101
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:22,249
the last time we tried to count on a

1102
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,630
signature having a certain technical

1103
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:27,738
property um have you had somebody verify

1104
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:29,809
that this is not depending on

1105
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:32,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">unauthorized properties it's a cold uh</font>

1106
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:34,970
yeah this so I think this was actually

1107
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:39,828
where we ended up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Karthik on the</font>

1108
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:41,480
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> go-around um and then we uh we went</font>

1109
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:45,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the parallelized thing after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> karthik</font>

1110
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:48,230
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would sort of be okay okay I</font>

1111
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:50,089
mean it's clear I mean I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> my point</font>

1112
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:58,609
is is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to meet the sig nu is a</font>

1113
00:50:50,089 --> 00:51:00,920
signature on am oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah this that</font>

1114
00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:04,759
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I wrote that in clearly so what I</font>

1115
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:09,170
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> is um that that should read sing</font>

1116
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:10,400
that you would send uh with<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1117
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:13,160
inner is the integrate is that the

1118
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:18,259
energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and promising on Thomas ago okay</font>

1119
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:20,509
yeah yeah sorry about that yeah so the

1120
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:22,069
the proposed version is written wrong

1121
00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:24,950
because I did it while jet lag this

1122
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:26,690
morning on the the inner the inner

1123
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:32,480
signed content that is signed by the new

1124
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:34,430
key is M comma<font color="#E5E5E5"> sig old em right so the</font>

1125
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,340
both keys end up signing over the

1126
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:41,680
content just make sure

1127
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:41,680
yeah but what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by unambiguous</font>

1128
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:52,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">why what what I mean is that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1129
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,450
want to be confusion about which part of

1130
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the message you're signing is the</font>

1131
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:59,060
signature in which part is the message

1132
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:00,740
oh sure ok so I think though if they're

1133
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:02,270
merely concatenated we're back to like

1134
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,669
oh is that what the length of these

1135
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:06,740
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other way the way we did</font>

1136
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:09,730
this in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lot and a couple iterations</font>

1137
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:12,200
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just create a whole jws object</font>

1138
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:14,660
that you know has the the payload all

1139
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,830
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you wrap it in another jws</font>

1140
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,720
object so like it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> blow d</font>

1141
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:19,549
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of what Jacob didn't like</font>

1142
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:23,529
when you did the parallelization but

1143
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,530
it's in some ways conceptually simpler

1144
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:30,410
Ted<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardy and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having a moment here</font>

1145
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:32,089
that it's making<font color="#E5E5E5"> me feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1146
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,730
missing something and it may be just

1147
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:37,880
because I'm missing the M comma say gold

1148
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:39,830
m here but I would have thought that it

1149
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:50,450
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have worked better to have cig old</font>

1150
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:53,420
sign em comma a sig nu m but the

1151
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:57,259
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that somebody who could extract</font>

1152
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:59,060
the part of the object that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> M & sig</font>

1153
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:05,140
old em but then sign it with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1154
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:09,740
sig nu and and therefore be asserting it

1155
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:11,900
based on an extracted signature of sick

1156
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:14,299
old over and yet recall however that M

1157
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,930
includes both outright hidden yeah so

1158
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,330
yeah things are signing over both keys

1159
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:22,220
can can I ask us to break away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this</font>

1160
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,690
and look at the real struct can you do

1161
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:26,930
you have the real struck somewhere the

1162
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:29,380
current struct yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1163
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:33,350
parallel on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the upper plot this better</font>

1164
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:35,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay actually just sent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the list the</font>

1165
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:37,970
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> struct when young</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1166
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:40,270
when we take this and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

1167
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:43,520
will help yep will do all this visual

1168
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:46,490
yeah Phil Han Becca<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey yeah I'm kind of</font>

1169
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:49,009
confused there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only gonna be one copy</font>

1170
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:52,350
of the blob that is signed I hope

1171
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:54,480
because that yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's correct ok</font>

1172
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:59,400
just ya cuz that's not what you said

1173
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:01,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah there is only the thing about the</font>

1174
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,860
wrapping I mean like I I think the

1175
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:08,339
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have here is we have a</font>

1176
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:10,350
notation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that isn't Jason yeah and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1177
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,030
discuss this particular point we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

1178
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:14,040
see the Jason to understand what the

1179
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:18,240
hell's going on totally agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I</font>

1180
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:22,440
apologize jet lag um no the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

1181
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:25,979
you will have a jws whose payload is the

1182
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:30,870
message the signing<font color="#CCCCCC"> key for that jws</font>

1183
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:34,200
will be the old key and then that whole

1184
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:36,509
jws will be serialized base64 encoded

1185
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:40,589
and become the payload of another jws

1186
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:42,150
who's signing key is the new key so

1187
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:44,400
there's one copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message being</font>

1188
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:46,160
sign which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is inside all of that layer</font>

1189
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,390
of wrapping inside the pale at the

1190
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,330
inside the inner<font color="#CCCCCC"> jade of us which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1191
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:52,859
payload<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the outer jws like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said it</font>

1192
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:59,100
is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lodi there's a bunch of day</font>

1193
00:54:52,860 --> 00:55:02,850
64 encoding here but let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> let me send</font>

1194
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:05,460
the concrete stuff Celeste yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1195
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:09,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">just wanted to give a it's a sort of a</font>

1196
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:11,100
data point Brian Campbell on you

1197
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:14,070
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Jose libraries only</font>

1198
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:15,600
support a single signature model of jws

1199
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:18,210
which is true<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to have one of</font>

1200
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:21,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">those libraries but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I got an issue filed</font>

1201
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,830
on the asking about how to do exactly

1202
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,229
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were proposing the most recent</font>

1203
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:27,509
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is almost</font>

1204
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:30,480
trivial to support the multiple

1205
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:32,490
signature model as long as the you don't

1206
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,110
make use of like the unprotected headers

1207
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:35,279
to hold the algorithm or anything kind

1208
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:38,280
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny like that the way you've done</font>

1209
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,860
it now I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the limitation on</font>

1210
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,240
library support for is particularly a

1211
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,680
big concern because you can take

1212
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,370
libraries like mine that don't support

1213
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,779
the and it's like a few lines to just

1214
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:51,930
kind of mix and match and put it in

1215
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:53,760
there so for whatever it's worth I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1216
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:56,040
have a sort of dog in the fight but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1217
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,310
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a major like stumbling</font>

1218
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,750
block yeah okay fair point yeah i still

1219
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,680
like kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the architectural point a</font>

1220
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,460
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it sounds like</font>

1221
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,009
there's no

1222
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,810
huge concerns raised here or so we'll

1223
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:08,970
probably end up being<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion between</font>

1224
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:10,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">jacob and myself because we're kind of</font>

1225
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:14,368
on opposite sides of this so we'll hash

1226
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:16,109
it out and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposals to list for</font>

1227
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:17,820
more concrete feedback and again

1228
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:24,029
apologies for the really<font color="#E5E5E5"> confusing</font>

1229
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:26,670
notation here next is anyone care about

1230
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:31,170
nonces anyone feeling overwhelmed with

1255
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:27,450
knots so they suggested that to restrict

00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:29,189
the requirement to<font color="#E5E5E5"> only requiring the</font>

00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:38,910

other than opposed to that will give you

1276
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,400
proportionally in proportion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,520
knotts number of nonsense

1279
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:22,450
issued so I'm inclined to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let this one</font>

1280
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:24,970
drop unless um someone feels strongly

1281
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:26,560
about this there might be more

1282
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:28,149
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list but I'm not</font>

1284
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:32,079
mic on this by dropped you can just

1285
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:35,849
close the issue just closed the issue

1286
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">and leave the requirement as it is yeah</font>

1287
00:58:36,329 --> 00:58:42,250
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mountain Thompson I know that I've</font>

1288
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:46,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">just been discussing replay of post</font>

1289
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:48,579
requests in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last session I wonder if</font>

1290
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:50,740
we could send<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same notes on every</font>

1291
00:58:48,579 --> 00:58:55,720
request and not actually check them and

1292
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:58,450
it would still work you will end up with

1293
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:02,970
engine or authorization did see a server

1294
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:07,029
concerns the same Lance yeah I mean to

1295
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:09,339
sort of comply with the spec and allow

1296
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:11,560
clients to do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want but but</font>

1297
00:59:09,339 --> 00:59:13,359
ultimately not actually worried about

1298
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,980
this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this become what are the</font>

1299
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">consequences of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> replaying the situation</font>

1300
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,220
that's almost as bad as the other

1301
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:19,540
suggestion is mailing list which was

1302
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">just dropping the replay knots all</font>

1303
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:26,130
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's effectively what I'm</font>

1304
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:28,630
suggesting yeah um why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that bad um</font>

1305
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:31,359
sort of for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same reason we have the</font>

1306
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:34,839
URL thing to protect from<font color="#CCCCCC"> CD ends</font>

1307
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:37,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">replaying requests for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font>

1308
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:39,069
cert request you could replay and you

1309
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,040
know get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new cert with the same</font>

1310
00:59:39,069 --> 00:59:45,130
parameters because there's no time in

00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:48,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not currently initiative</font>

1312
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:52,810
time it's all non spaced right and so

1313
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:55,598
this user request could<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen at any</font>

00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:57,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">time yeah you can you know waiting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

1315
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:01,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">anytime throughout the length of the</font>

1316
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:02,980
authorization<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I mean that may not</font>

1317
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,480
be a big deal because you know the

1318
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:07,390
attacker in this case might not have the

1319
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,150
private key but maybe he does so I'm

1320
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:19,290
inclined to keep I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm disinclined to</font>

1321
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:19,290
drop the replay protection yeah

1322
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:27,300
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all wait for wrecker yeah I</font>

1323
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:30,080
wouldn't got the repo protection but

1324
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:33,750
this strikes me as a false economy

1325
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting the proposal yes I mean like any</font>

1326
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:38,610
operational server is like probably

1327
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:39,750
records about<font color="#E5E5E5"> four kilobytes of data for</font>

1328
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:42,960
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP requests it receives</font>

1329
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:45,510
so like the have you have any having do

1330
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to also store 128 bits or so of</font>

1331
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:49,530
nods for some short period of time does

1332
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:53,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">not strike me as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> particularly onerous</font>

1333
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:54,840
obligation yeah okay sounding<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1334
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:56,280
there's some agreement with the the

1335
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:00,180
proposal to leave the requirement as it

1336
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:02,760
is um next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide yeah okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so after</font>

1337
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:04,770
having drafted this the applications

1338
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,830
flow which we will re add the new

1339
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:10,710
authorization flow to as anchor pointed

1340
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:13,500
out the need um there were some

1341
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:15,600
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that arise and some things you</font>

1342
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,810
could do with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> new application flow</font>

1343
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:20,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are not inspect right now so if you</font>

1344
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:22,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the ssl made api which has a</font>

1345
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:24,330
similar sort of request a certificate

1346
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:27,690
you apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a certificate get</font>

1347
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:30,740
requirements flow um that<font color="#CCCCCC"> api requires</font>

1348
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:33,030
the client to send another request to

1349
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:34,859
actually issue the certificate so once

1350
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:37,440
all the requirements have been met the

1351
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:41,640
client has to say yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want the</font>

1352
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:44,460
certificate go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and issue it so I</font>

1353
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:46,230
dropped an open issue in the in dark as

1354
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,580
to whether we should have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra</font>

1355
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:49,560
step<font color="#E5E5E5"> their requirement basically</font>

1356
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,730
confirmation from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client that you</font>

1357
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,460
should go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead that the server should</font>

1358
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:56,400
issue the certificate I<font color="#E5E5E5"> note that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1359
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:58,950
morning Andrew air the ssl made<font color="#CCCCCC"> altar</font>

1360
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,359
said no we should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him given</font>

1361
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:04,859
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> operational experiences it's not</font>

1362
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:07,259
worth the<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra step any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them have</font>

1363
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:10,560
feedback on that question seems simpler

1364
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:12,300
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it as it is guess I'll leave</font>

1365
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:16,109
it that way until someone complains um

1366
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:18,590
the other thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is consider</font>

1367
01:02:16,109 --> 01:02:21,840
making these requests modifiable or

1368
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:24,450
supporting multiple CSRs so maybe a CA

1369
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:27,810
will you know allow a single order to

1370
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:30,629
issue both are<font color="#CCCCCC"> sao issue certificates</font>

1371
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:31,869
for both our essay and ecdsa keys for

1372
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:34,809
the same subject

1373
01:02:31,869 --> 01:02:39,670
and so you could send in two CSRs at

1374
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:42,279
once and have the request end up issuing

1375
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:49,089
multiple certificates Ted<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1376
01:02:42,279 --> 01:02:50,440
furrowing your brow here while he's

1377
01:02:49,089 --> 01:02:52,538
blocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll say the other use case for</font>

1378
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:55,390
this is renewal so you might want to

1379
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:58,660
enable a client to say change the dates

1380
01:02:55,390 --> 01:03:01,390
on this on the on the application change

1381
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:03,160
not before not after and caused that to

1382
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:04,690
reissue a certificate with new dates

1383
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:08,348
assuming all the requirements was still

1384
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:13,210
satisfied Ted Ted Hardy from the floor

1385
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:15,730
microphone for those in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ether I was</font>

1386
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:17,529
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to imagine how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much savings</font>

1387
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:21,309
there was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be in not</font>

1388
01:03:17,529 --> 01:03:24,609
having each of the multiple CSRs be in

1389
01:03:21,309 --> 01:03:26,619
in a separate application because that

1390
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:29,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to be the obvious option here</font>

1391
01:03:26,619 --> 01:03:31,569
and I was wondering if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had any mean</font>

1392
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,399
what are we actually saving by not

1393
01:03:31,569 --> 01:03:35,109
having them be in their independent

1394
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,239
applications yes so from chatting with

1395
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:41,170
Andrew I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understand that there are</font>

1396
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:44,140
some CA cases right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now where where</font>

1397
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:46,269
you're paying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the order and if you</font>

1398
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:47,739
get them both together you they're

1399
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:50,140
considered as one order in one

1400
01:03:47,739 --> 01:03:53,289
transaction and you pay once for both of

1401
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:54,640
those certificates<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

1402
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:56,230
that's something we need to reflect at

1403
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,049
this layer of the protocol I don't think

1404
01:03:56,230 --> 01:04:01,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I so personally speaking I would say</font>

1405
01:03:59,049 --> 01:04:04,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that into this state</font>

1406
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,910
mechanics doesn't seem sensible if they

1407
01:04:04,779 --> 01:04:10,359
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that they can have an order</font>

1408
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:12,940
ID where if you're all associated with

1409
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:14,890
the same order ID the order ID means

1410
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:18,359
that you pay your transaction fee just

1411
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:20,499
once if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this this handy code</font>

1412
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:24,549
maybe they could reuse the nonce for

1413
01:04:20,499 --> 01:04:28,359
that no I didn't mean that um but uh

1414
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:29,920
yeah I'm not a huge fan um how about

1415
01:04:28,359 --> 01:04:35,859
renewal while you're up then he thought

1416
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:39,609

1421
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:51,640
excellent nice clear answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font>

1422
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:54,220
all I'll delete that open issue from the

some feedbacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list this morning and</font>

1428
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:08,410
I haven't had<font color="#E5E5E5"> any time to look at that</font>

1429
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,970

1433
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:24,730

of acne all the way back the individual

1435
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:30,460
submission stage had not one but two

1436
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:32,410
mechanisms by which an account holder

1437
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:34,900
who has lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> his account key could</font>

1438
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:38,049
recover his account and gain control of

1439
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:40,210
it again contact face recovery you know

1440
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:42,520
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> me an email sort of recovery in a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Mac based recovery scheme where you use</font>

1442
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,350
a short code that you've been provided

1443
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:52,150
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA um both of those have since</font>

1445
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:58,000
I've still got some notes in my to-do

1446
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:59,710
lists to think about doing this there

1447
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,270
was some<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Karthik's</font>

1448
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:03,190
analysis pointed to some recovery

1449
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:04,750
mechanisms that would be that would be

1450
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:06,340
workable that would be good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and</font>

1451
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:08,890
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some thought about you know</font>

1452
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:10,630
outlining a recovery mechanism in here

1453
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:12,520
that you can instantiate in a few ways

1454
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:15,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">but not actually providing a concrete</font>

1455
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:17,980
instantiation benefit would be that you

1456
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:19,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we would capture the for posterity</font>

1457
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:22,120
this framework that we'd agreed was

1458
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,940
cryptographically sound if only you had

1459
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:27,250
a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provision the right bits and so</font>

1460
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:29,260
save the risk of getting it wrong in

1461
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:31,480
principle reduce the risk of getting it

1462
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,860
wrong later but I wouldn't really

1463
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,990
provide much utility in the short term

1464
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:38,110
so i guess the proposal here has to kind

1465
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:41,140
of declare recovery well and truly dead

1466
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:43,510
um does anyone think that losing your

1467
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:47,220
account key is something we really need

1468
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about I guess is this yeah um</font>

1469
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if recovery mechanism</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in Acme I</font>

1470
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:56,749
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly the case</font>

1471
01:06:55,369 --> 01:06:59,779
actual operational see any somebody to

1472
01:06:56,749 --> 01:07:02,749
deal with this well yes um well not

1473
01:06:59,779 --> 01:07:04,190
necessarily I mean like if you're if the

1474
01:07:02,749 --> 01:07:05,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">only requirement is that you show up you</font>

1475
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:07,309
validate your domains like you can

1476
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">principal you can generate a new key</font>

1477
01:07:07,309 --> 01:07:10,759
pair validate all your domains and yeah

1478
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:14,180
it's a bit of a headache but you haven't

1479
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:16,039
lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything really huge um I mean I</font>

1480
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:18,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we discussed this when you first</font>

1481
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:20,150
when let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> first started right and one</font>

1482
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these people sick concerns was that</font>

1483
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:27,380
um was that we not be possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1484
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,970
reissue<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domains which are already</font>

1485
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:32,240
been issued for without<font color="#E5E5E5"> extreme measures</font>

1486
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:34,399
and so merely showing up with a new

1487
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,288
account key and validating your demands

1488
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,029
makes it hard to discriminate<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

1489
01:07:36,289 --> 01:07:40,160
situation where I've decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

1490
01:07:38,029 --> 01:07:41,329
over all<font color="#E5E5E5"> your accounts and situation</font>

1491
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,480
where you actually lost your account key

1492
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:45,829
so now maybe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you need maybe</font>

1493
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,690
neither scope mechanism is sufficient

1494
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:50,269
for setting that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> resetting that you</font>

1495
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:51,619
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recover</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the key um but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1496
01:07:50,269 --> 01:07:53,269
do not think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the case that you do</font>

1497
01:07:51,619 --> 01:07:55,009
not need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a hen situation which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1498
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,328
lose their keys and discriminative in

1499
01:07:55,009 --> 01:07:58,549
that situation which I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to take</font>

1500
01:07:56,329 --> 01:07:59,749
over your accounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so do i mean but</font>

1501
01:07:58,549 --> 01:08:01,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd be fine i think the</font>

1502
01:07:59,749 --> 01:08:02,629
one way to handle out would be to say

1503
01:08:01,099 --> 01:08:04,519
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recovery mechanisms were</font>

1504
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:08,150
inherently basically manual and that the

1505
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:10,399
way of CA handles this is by um is is by

1506
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:12,470
basically having a manual process which

1507
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,910
are sets you back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state as if the</font>

1508
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:17,420
is if these<font color="#CCCCCC"> demain center from register</font>

1509
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:18,948
and then allows you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and that</font>

1510
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:21,830
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage that would be that</font>

1511
01:08:18,948 --> 01:08:24,678
that does not introduced new new<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you</font>

1512
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:25,908
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> come sec</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um logic errors in the the</font>

1513
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:28,699
system otherwise we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a worst-case</font>

1514
01:08:25,908 --> 01:08:31,009
scenario is that your back to ground

1515
01:08:28,698 --> 01:08:33,318
zero as opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you recovered</font>

1516
01:08:31,009 --> 01:08:34,609
decal key so I can that be fun but I

1517
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:40,969
think the I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> think something should</font>

1518
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">be said here okay um I'm a good way to</font>

1519
01:08:40,969 --> 01:08:44,779
spend like<font color="#E5E5E5"> may I guess my point is is</font>

1520
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:46,420
the first question<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to ask is</font>

1521
01:08:44,779 --> 01:08:48,469
what if I lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> the account key and so</font>

1522
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:51,109
your answer is going to be this is out

1523
01:08:48,469 --> 01:08:53,509
of scope for the protocol that's the

1524
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:55,400
question on the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think exactly</font>

1525
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:56,630
we say it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ea's have to solve on their</font>

1526
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:57,948
own however they do it i guess i would

1527
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,690
say i was just as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guidance of you</font>

1528
01:08:57,948 --> 01:09:01,658
ever read about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the guy didn't the</font>

1529
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:04,698
guidance guidance will be fine to say

1530
01:09:01,658 --> 01:09:08,179
that in wit CA should probably have some

1531
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:09,919
manual process<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind for</font>

1532
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:11,750
dealing the calc you recover<font color="#CCCCCC"> E and we</font>

1533
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">recommend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they basically just the</font>

1534
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:18,050
account rather than<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recover the</font>

1535
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:21,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">key so Martin times and I mean part of</font>

1536
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the additional extra steps that you</font>

1537
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:25,610
might do is have different challenges in

1538
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:28,610
response two or more challenges in

1539
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:30,859
response to that the request to create

1540
01:09:28,609 --> 01:09:32,779
authorizations for which an existing

1541
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:34,910
account already has an existing

1542
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:36,859
registration already has authorization I

1543
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:39,649
mean that could be a policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice that</font>

1544
01:09:36,859 --> 01:09:45,170
the CIA could make let's definitely see

1545
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:47,809
a policy notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> rushed honestly so what</font>

1546
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:51,050
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're saying is that the ca</font>

1547
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:53,030
still remembers the public key but for

1548
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:55,610
whatever reason the client can't

1549
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:58,730
remember or is it doesn't i forgot that

1550
01:09:55,610 --> 01:10:01,490
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot my pastor private key or the</font>

1551
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:05,120
key to recover it from whatever file he

1552
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:07,160
is right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a section on</font>

1553
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:10,809
operational considerations that says you

1554
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:14,930
need a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a replacement</font>

1555
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:20,000
account key as opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing any kind</font>

1556
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:22,160
of recovery because that encourages one

1557
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,040
to store it in some other place like it

1558
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:29,510
in the cloud or whatever well so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1559
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:31,040
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask russ at the</font>

1560
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:35,330
mic whether he would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be willing to draft</font>

1561
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:39,200
some text as a initial take on this to

1562
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:44,990
provide to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group sure so</font>

1563
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:46,429
just for context here um the recovery

1564
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:48,260
mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd sketched out with karthik</font>

1565
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:50,420
was basically the rollover mechanism

1566
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:53,540
here except if you would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sign</font>

1567
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:55,550
with the old well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over not</font>

1568
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:58,790
from the old key to the new key but you

1569
01:10:55,550 --> 01:11:00,830
can roll over from a mac key to a new

1570
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:02,360
key if you've provisioned then what if

1571
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:05,950
you don't know where that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is i read that</font>

1572
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:10,089
that leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same situation as the</font>

1573
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:12,889
revoke your certificate if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we signing a</font>

1574
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:15,980
revocation request with your revocation

1575
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:18,470
key and right right so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just what</font>

1576
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:21,489
key did I lose that I can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

1577
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:24,079
expected me to do yeah

1578
01:11:21,489 --> 01:11:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so I think Becker is probably about</font>

1579
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,369
right by providing<font color="#CCCCCC"> our and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Russ about</font>

1580
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:31,549
providing operational considerations and

1581
01:11:28,369 --> 01:11:32,989
kind of reset anything so rust was the

1582
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:37,150
answer to Ted's question you'll craft

1583
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:41,089
some text for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great fantastic</font>

1584
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:44,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right um yeah the only last question</font>

1585
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:47,510
here was we have the way we do scoping

1586
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:50,268
in graph 23 is the authorization struct

1587
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:53,300
has a scope field in it which is either

1588
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:54,889
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> present or it is the URL for an</font>

1589
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:58,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">application to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which this authorization</font>

1590
01:11:54,889 --> 01:12:00,530
belongs um pretty rudimentary scoping

1591
01:11:58,699 --> 01:12:03,138
but I think it covers at least some use

1592
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:05,329
cases and question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's a need</font>

1593
01:12:03,139 --> 01:12:07,610
for more this is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a really</font>

1594
01:12:05,329 --> 01:12:09,259
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss right now but just to</font>

1595
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:11,539
throw a flag in case people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1596
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:13,730
cases that need more different scoping

1597
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:15,909
or something else all right I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1598
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:19,218
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I've got for open issues um</font>

1599
01:12:15,909 --> 01:12:23,268
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so last call it's a thing next</font>

1600
01:12:19,219 --> 01:12:25,280
slide for those who<font color="#CCCCCC"> might not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be might</font>

1601
01:12:23,269 --> 01:12:30,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">not have the ITF process swapped in um</font>

1602
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:33,980
this is my cartoon of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process um</font>

1603
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:39,558
we're on the scale not no no not this

1604
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:44,749
good roughly scaled right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea</font>

1605
01:12:39,559 --> 01:12:47,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">is well it really it should be kind of</font>

1606
01:12:44,749 --> 01:12:50,389
kind of spiky you know we're working her

1607
01:12:47,749 --> 01:12:54,380
work occurs at IETF deadlines during the

1608
01:12:50,389 --> 01:12:55,940
actual work phase um so yeah the idea is

1609
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:57,769
you know we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of work on</font>

1610
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:59,449
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> refining it and then there's a</font>

1611
01:12:57,769 --> 01:13:01,070
bunch of last calls for comments and

1612
01:12:59,449 --> 01:13:03,799
ballots that go out before it gets to be

1613
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:05,329
entire NRC but the idea is once we send

1614
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,739
it off on that path we should feel

1615
01:13:05,329 --> 01:13:10,759
pretty comfortable that all the major

1616
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:13,280
issues have been addressed so the

1617
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:14,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is do we at least have a list</font>

1618
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:18,139
of the major<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues that we need to</font>

1619
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:21,679
address as we prepare to send this off

1620
01:13:18,139 --> 01:13:26,690
in the sometime in the fall<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the next</font>

1621
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:28,369
slide so we had a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> left over</font>

1622
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:31,728
from previous sections and action items

1623
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:34,549
for for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors to resolve um this</font>

1624
01:13:31,729 --> 01:13:36,260
is kind of a a when I was

1625
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:39,139
can group trees the second to<font color="#CCCCCC"> last call</font>

1626
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:41,739
for comments the call for issues

1627
01:13:39,139 --> 01:13:47,030
anything that you think is ambiguous or

1628
01:13:41,739 --> 01:13:48,379
not covered by the current spec so I

1629
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:50,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it would be good to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a list of</font>

1630
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:52,699
issues pretty soon now on people could

1631
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,699
flush those issues out to the lists kind

1632
01:13:52,699 --> 01:13:57,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">of as soon as possible and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

1633
01:13:55,699 --> 01:14:00,169
work on getting those addressed in the

1634
01:13:57,170 --> 01:14:01,639
next few weeks and it would also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

1635
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,900
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of implementations</font>

1636
01:14:01,639 --> 01:14:04,969
will latest like I've talked to the

1637
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:07,460
let's encrypt guys they're going to

1638
01:14:04,969 --> 01:14:09,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">start working on upgrading their server</font>

1639
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:13,040
pretty soon now<font color="#CCCCCC"> well if you go to the</font>

1640
01:14:09,739 --> 01:14:15,049
next slide the rough timeline I've got

1641
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:18,079
in my mind at least talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

1642
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:20,719
other authors is getting together with

1643
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:23,269
the feedback from this meeting and the

1644
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:25,219
issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists and kind of hammering out a</font>

1645
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:27,559
bunch of the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know is</font>

1646
01:14:25,219 --> 01:14:30,770
outstanding right now and turning that

1647
01:14:27,559 --> 01:14:32,090
into another working group draft which

1648
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:35,300
will consider sort of an implementation

1649
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:37,340
target so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lots and crypt guys</font>

1650
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:38,420
will start implementing hopefully some

1651
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,949
other folks who out there who have

1652
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:42,110
clients or servers will start

1653
01:14:39,949 --> 01:14:44,419
implementing as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get some</font>

1654
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,920
experience with whatever the light of

1655
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:51,050
this implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is like so</font>

1656
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:53,389
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be probably 04 so I think the hope</font>

1657
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:56,599
would be produced<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sometime mid next</font>

1658
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:59,210
month I have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> confidence in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1659
01:14:56,599 --> 01:15:01,460
than I did the last time that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

1660
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:03,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">gave it the last IETF meeting and then</font>

1661
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:04,760
we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at implementation through</font>

1662
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:06,079
September maybe have a virtual interim

1663
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,809
to address any issues that come up as we

1664
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:11,750
do implementation and aim for working

1665
01:15:08,809 --> 01:15:15,349
group last call in October so note that

1666
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:20,210
the next meeting for the IETF that's a

1667
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">face-to-face</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting is in November 13</font>

1668
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:25,670
through 18th and it is the intention of

1669
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:29,059
this group that this should go up to the

1670
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:35,000
iesg before that meeting and so we

1671
01:15:29,059 --> 01:15:37,190
consider that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal so this this</font>

1672
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,780
timeline is to accomplish that everybody

1673
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:42,169
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> it okay with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the timeline of</font>

1674
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,940
course we could

1675
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:46,160
faster than<font color="#CCCCCC"> this if people are</font>

1676
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:48,589
interested in being faster and trust me

1677
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:52,150
we would be very happy at that really

1678
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:52,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's all getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on Russ at this point</font>

1679
01:15:55,870 --> 01:16:03,320
it's a really important paragraph yeah

1680
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:05,660
all right so yeah well<font color="#CCCCCC"> get together with</font>

1681
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:07,540
the other authors on fs-d ittf meeting

1682
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:10,309
and see if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this hammered out um</font>

1683
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:12,199
and get some implementation going<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

1684
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:15,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think that is the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my silence oh</font>

1685
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:18,169
right I have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more thing um speaking</font>

1686
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,480
of implementation after getting dressed

1687
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh 3 out I thought gee wouldn't it be</font>

1688
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,169
great to actually have an implementation

1689
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:27,770
of the current spec going so I started

1690
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:29,750
one up next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide reviving some old code</font>

1691
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:32,780
Joe Hildebrand and I started work on a

1692
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:34,730
nodejs implementation of acne um so I've

1693
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:39,469
kind of revived that under the branding

1694
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:42,830
rocketskates<font color="#CCCCCC"> vido acne it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> designed to</font>

1695
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:45,350
be light and fast the idea here is to

1696
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:47,660
have kind of a pedagogical client and

1697
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,860
server stack so to demonstrate what the

1698
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:50,780
layer the architecture is of the

1699
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:52,759
protocol help people understand the

1700
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:55,460
protocol help people do testing of their

1701
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:58,100
other implementations and maybe provide

1702
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:59,420
some test Suites still very much a work

1703
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:00,710
in progress right now I've got a

1704
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:03,679
transport layer together which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I</font>

1705
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:06,350
got thinking about all of this parallel

1706
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,400
signature stuff um server-side logic is

1707
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:09,890
mostly complete and haven't done

1708
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:11,449
anything with the client side so anyone

1709
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:13,820
is interested in collaborating or

1710
01:17:11,449 --> 01:17:16,580
providing feedback here very interested

1711
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:21,250
in getting this hack together that is

1712
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:23,870
actually the end of my slides artists

1713
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:26,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we'll go back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the chair</font>

1714
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:29,660
slides now and I'm about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw this</font>

1715
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:34,760
up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and he's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font>

1716
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:39,620
whether he he's going to be a blank or

1717
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:42,140
have words and whoever gets the upside

1718
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:44,780
will take red and whoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets the</font>

1719
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:49,489
downside will take green so sure

1720
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:52,759
warrants words came up here Rick<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1721
01:17:49,489 --> 01:17:56,030
all right if you are

1722
01:17:52,760 --> 01:18:00,530
red-green colorblind my apologies the

1723
01:17:56,030 --> 01:18:06,940
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> side is the contrary or red side</font>

1724
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:17,420
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the green side is the proponent or</font>

1725
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:19,190
green okay so um given the the timetable

1726
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:21,710
that's been proposed and we seem to have

1727
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:25,789
agreement on the question is what do we

1728
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:29,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">do next or do we do anything if anything</font>

1729
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:32,449
next I'll point out that the next

1730
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:36,500
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is november in seoul which might</font>

1731
01:18:32,449 --> 01:18:38,299
has might have lesser attendant but are

1732
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:41,119
there any<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to</font>

1733
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:44,239
consider taking on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> new work do you</font>

1734
01:18:41,119 --> 01:18:46,480
want to just not meet and declare

1735
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:48,739
victory and wait and see what happens

1736
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:50,808
anyone prepared to make a proposal at

1737
01:18:48,739 --> 01:18:52,699
this point for what stuff to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

1738
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:54,530
you're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to argue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> read i supposed</font>

1739
01:18:52,699 --> 01:18:56,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">to argue read okay we're done right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1740
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:57,739
thinking would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great if if the</font>

1741
01:18:56,119 --> 01:18:59,420
minutes from this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> had two</font>

1742
01:18:57,739 --> 01:19:01,489
sentences which are about to go into

1743
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:03,409
last call recommend the recharter I

1744
01:19:01,489 --> 01:19:11,000
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> our ad would have any</font>

1745
01:19:03,409 --> 01:19:13,339
problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no pardon I yeah sure</font>

1746
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,539
and so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll argue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to green side and</font>

1747
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,190
it's clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are some other</font>

1748
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:18,170
potential use cases for automated

1749
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:20,030
certificate management we know those now

1750
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:22,159
recharter to handle those<font color="#E5E5E5"> and remain</font>

1751
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:24,759
available as a working group respect

1752
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:29,150
bugs and a potential abyss should

1753
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:31,340
operational experience show that so it

1754
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:33,379
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask rich</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1755
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:35,690
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> so how many drafts are there</font>

1756
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:38,750
waiting for working group adoption Ted

1757
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:41,329
uh well there are none now but we have

1758
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:43,369
discouraged anybody from trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1759
01:19:41,329 --> 01:19:45,230
ahead of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> finishing of this one so</font>

1760
01:19:43,369 --> 01:19:47,989
the I I don't know that there are none

1761
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:52,030
sitting in edit buffers waiting for when

1762
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:55,369
has discouragement ever worked right now

1763
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:57,800
yeah yeah well so we flipped a coin to

1764
01:19:55,369 --> 01:20:00,589
see who is going to take which one um as

1765
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:04,159
the green proponent I have to say there

1766
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:05,960
there clearly are cases for certificate

1767
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,620
management where there is no web server

1768
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,470
involved

1769
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:11,690
and so some of the challenges are

1770
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:13,520
inappropriate to that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of automated</font>

1771
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:15,589
certificate management people have

1772
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,470
discussed for example creating a a

1773
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:20,330
client certificate mechanism in Acme

1774
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:24,260
that would be appropriate to jabber

1775
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:25,610
clients for example that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

1776
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:28,040
thing wouldn't be covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the current</font>

1777
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:31,099
set of challenges at all and it is work

1778
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:32,810
we could consider taking on now do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font>

1779
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:36,800
not know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody has an edit buffer</font>

1780
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:38,690
full of this but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1781
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,300
we want to kick off discussion on the

1782
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:43,219
mailing list with the presumption that

1783
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:45,560
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to close down before soul or</font>

1784
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:47,300
we're going to send things off before so

1785
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:49,700
not meet in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seoul because we have no</font>

1786
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:51,770
work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our on our plate and we would</font>

1787
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:53,990
recharter a new working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group if work</font>

1788
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:55,880
came up or do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say let's be</font>

1789
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:57,200
realistic ones once somebody's built a

1790
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:00,350
building block people want to build new

1791
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:02,389
things with it will presume that those

1792
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:05,840
new things come in after this and that

1793
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:07,940
starts in so that's the argument so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1794
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,530
to provide people<font color="#E5E5E5"> some concrete use</font>

1795
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:11,900
cases other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

1796
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:13,550
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got I've had in my head and</font>

1797
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:15,320
haven't don't even have an edit buffer

1798
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:17,990
right now where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there would</font>

1799
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:21,950
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some potential uptake and</font>

1800
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:24,080
some real usage<font color="#E5E5E5"> r1 doing acne for EV</font>

1801
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:25,639
certificates you know assuming when we

1802
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,550
get the whole payment thing working and

1803
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:30,440
there's some combination to be done I've

1804
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:32,570
talked to some folks who do EV issuance

1805
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:34,099
and do automation around EV issuance and

1806
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:35,320
they'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interested I've got some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks</font>

1807
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:38,060
who would be interested in contributing

1808
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:40,759
but like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said nothing even in a buffer</font>

1809
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:42,890
right now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I think</font>

1810
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've heard the a few folks mention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1811
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:49,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of extending the CAA the ca</font>

1812
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:50,900
authorization domain dns record which

1813
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,059
currently right now can say these are

1814
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:55,849
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CAS that are authorized to issue for</font>

1815
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:57,290
me I've heard some folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask to also</font>

1816
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an extension of that where you can</font>

1817
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:02,750
specify Acme validation mechanisms to

1818
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:04,580
whitelist only HTTP validation should be

1819
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:07,970
done our only DNS validation should be

1820
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:09,230
done so just to again not in an edit

1821
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,670
buffer it but has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been proposed by</font>

1822
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:13,790
multiple people so there might be some

1823
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:15,020
interest around that so yeah just to

1824
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:19,280
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> people an idea of what some of</font>

1825
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:19,950
these extensions might be yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mountain</font>

1826
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thompson the reason I</font>

1827
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:24,389
up to us that question is oh I'm not

1828
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:26,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually seeing anything but thanks to</font>

1829
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:28,410
Richard I'm seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of those</font>

1830
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">things it is perhaps the right plan here</font>

1831
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:35,220
to use this time to solicit at least

1832
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:37,170
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> rough drafts on those ones so we</font>

1833
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:39,660
can sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get an idea of what's out</font>

1834
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:43,050
there and when we're obviously not

1835
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:44,670
closing the working group tomorrow so we

1836
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:47,670
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of time to collect</font>

1837
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:49,470
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information so once we have</font>

1838
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:50,640
well once we get to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1839
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:52,080
looking at our area director to make

1840
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure she wasn't closing the working</font>

1841
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,530
group tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever I'm running once</font>

1842
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:56,910
we get to the point lil nervous where

1843
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:58,980
we're actually done with this document

1844
01:22:56,910 --> 01:23:01,110
which yeah it should be fairly soon we

1845
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:03,150
might have a better idea yeah so

1846
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:05,519
Kathleen Moriarty and thank you martin<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1847
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:08,460
think having some drafts would be good

1848
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,810
before we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually changing a charter</font>

1849
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:14,490
right because then you could sit forever

1850
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:16,380
and do nothing Phil home baker yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

1851
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they're a bunch of application</font>

1852
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:21,540
areas as well we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1853
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:23,940
because acne was really targeted at TLS

1854
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:25,290
and there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other stuff I'd</font>

1855
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:30,299
like to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

1856
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:33,200
to use acne with DNS SEC I would like to

1857
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able to use acne with s mine and</font>

1858
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:38,580
there are different authentication

1859
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:41,130
challenges are going to be required and

1860
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:43,380
in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of s mine you want to be</font>

1861
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:48,030
able to send and receive the messages

1862
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:51,180
over smtp because you know having a mail

1863
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:55,410
client trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get certificates having</font>

1864
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:57,690
to do web transactions doesn't work so

1865
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:59,099
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ted Hardy with a chair hat on</font>

1866
01:23:57,690 --> 01:24:02,070
even though I'm standing in the pink box

1867
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:04,230
Mike I have a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our area</font>

1868
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:05,969
director of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether in the cases like</font>

1869
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:08,250
that where it's a significantly

1870
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:11,250
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> application whether we would</font>

1871
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:14,580
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it in a working group focused</font>

1872
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:16,260
on the ca management or focused on the

1873
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:19,200
application that is would it go to

1874
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:24,110
something like lamps to do to do this

1875
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:24,110
work or would it stay here

1876
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:33,019
so Kathleen<font color="#CCCCCC"> Moriarty um I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1877
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:35,510
depends if in a working group exists

1878
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:37,700
right and if that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right choice or</font>

1879
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:39,250
not and what this group wants to do

1880
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:42,800
right because you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a clean slate</font>

1881
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:47,090
when this work is done so lamps would be

1882
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:49,040
a clear case for s lime and<font color="#CCCCCC"> peach p</font>

1883
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:54,260
stuff but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Phillip also said</font>

1884
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:57,410
ipsec right so no dns sexo with<font color="#CCCCCC"> gina dns</font>

1885
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:59,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">up or somebody in the same community</font>

1886
01:24:57,410 --> 01:25:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">right right so it might go over right so</font>

1887
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:03,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just take it case by case</font>

1888
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:06,820
and see what comes in if there's an

1889
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:09,080
existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group or not um</font>

1890
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:10,610
sometimes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right place to do</font>

1891
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,230
that right so i have another working

1892
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:15,230
group right now that one draft isn't

1893
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:16,759
getting enough review and I think it

1894
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:21,919
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone over to a different</font>

1895
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:25,550
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that might happen relaying fro</font>

1896
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:27,620
eric berger um other enough drafts or

1897
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:33,380
ideas of drafts that they need more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

1898
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:36,620
ad sponsored so I think what I've heard

1899
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:38,000
so far is that there's some ideas and we

1900
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:40,400
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see some drafts and then</font>

1901
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,219
decisions can be made so I don't think

1902
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:45,080
word to the point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric is that</font>

1903
01:25:43,219 --> 01:25:48,020
because no there there aren't drafts yet

1904
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:50,030
there's ideas and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if</font>

1905
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:51,620
those drafts come to fruition and we

1906
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:57,170
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if we like them and think</font>

1907
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:58,340
they should be adopted Matt Miller I was

1908
01:25:57,170 --> 01:26:00,469
just coming up to say yes I think

1909
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:03,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting out the word on the list would</font>

1910
01:26:00,469 --> 01:26:05,719
help the discouragement was very

1911
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:07,460
effective and the other Thor I know that

1912
01:26:05,719 --> 01:26:09,830
there were ideas I do not recall what

1913
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:11,840
they were but even myself and many

1914
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:13,190
others said let's wait until we finish

1915
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,790
the main work before trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1916
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:19,219
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> here okay so it sounds like the</font>

1917
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:24,290
resolution of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red green is going to</font>

1918
01:26:19,219 --> 01:26:27,140

1919
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:29,510
we blend them into the requests the
