45
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,840
today's session I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it oh</font>

46
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:03,060
yeah we'll also be talking about the

privacy document as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so we have a</font>

48
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,810
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of major topics to talk about</font>

49
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,919
today at the last meeting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was last</font>

50
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,690
meeting we talked about splitting them

51
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,448
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah at the last meeting we came</font>

52
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,910
to the conclusion that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS the DNS</font>

53
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,250
push document<font color="#E5E5E5"> really needed to be split</font>

54
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,650
into two parts one of which is a more

55
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,020
general session maintenance document to

56
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,659
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns up and one is a specifics</font>

57
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,030
for managing dns SD push which will go

58
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,740
through this working group so we want to

59
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that we've got we understand</font>

60
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,740
the split of that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we get an</font>

61
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:42,090
update on where that work is

62
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:45,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">ah Ted lemon has been working on a</font>

63
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:50,159
document that<font color="#E5E5E5"> describes how unicast</font>

64
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,870
unicast DNS as the DNS update and hybrid

65
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,849
proxy approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> can all be integrated</font>

66
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,240
into a specific naming architecture for

67
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:58,680
home net we want to review that

68
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:04,470
architecture in this working group as

69
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:10,490
well Tom and I are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk briefly</font>

70
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:13,139
about hybrid proxy deployment and

71
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,680
configuration you know in a larger scale

72
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">network context this is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

73
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,669
also talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Stuart the idea</font>

74
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:22,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of components</font>

75
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:28,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all go together into a into a</font>

76
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:31,949
unicast DSS the deployment and we think

77
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's room for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp document</font>

78
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:36,810
that explains all of those pieces in

79
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,520
detail although they all are documented

80
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,680
various places it<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems good to bring</font>

81
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,109
them all together in one place and then

82
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,919
give some concrete examples of how you

83
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:49,740
can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization dns server</font>

84
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,870
hybrid proxy servers and the

85
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:57,719
characteristics<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the dns SD clients</font>

86
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:58,860
themselves to stitch together stitched

87
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:00,479
together clever deployments that

88
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,940
accomplish certain requirements over and

89
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">above simply giving a client a view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

90
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,520
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the dns st services across an</font>

91
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:12,650
entire organization and then we're going

92
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about the dns SD privacy work</font>

93
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:27,240
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the agenda nope no bashing needed</font>

94
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:31,500
huh<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned the hybrid proxy</font>

95
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:36,029
draft the plan is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart to apply</font>

96
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,659
some final updates will confirm that the

97
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:41,250
working group agrees that the updates

98
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,529
address the points raised at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

99
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:47,100
IETF meeting and then that document will

100
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,830
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to go to the iesg Kerry Kerry</font>

101
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">linen</font>

102
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:53,230
I've been away for a while question to

103
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:57,790
the chairs welcome back yes thanks maybe

104
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:59,350
it's a trend last time there was some

105
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,670
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time I attended there</font>

106
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,460
was some discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reach our during</font>

107
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,880
just wondering where that stands there

108
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,100
have been any more discussion other yeah

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think we're at the point where the</font>

110
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,080
hybrid proxy is a going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through in</font>

111
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,900
the next month or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two the DNS bush is</font>

112
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,460
now making it a way forward so we've got

113
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,670
some time at the end just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss</font>

114
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,280
next steps and that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> include what we</font>

115
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,349
might do to recharter I think Terry

116
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,459
Terry's in the room whether he left he

117
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:32,080
was as hiding<font color="#E5E5E5"> here behind somebody yeah</font>

118
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,390
so we can have that discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

119
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,000
ad but I think we want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear</font>

120
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,890
that we're in a good position with the

121
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">basic stuff we promised before we</font>

122
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:46,750
charter but we're probably quite close

123
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:48,520
to that now I think so yeah go ahead

124
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,680
sorry so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question here</font>

125
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,920
is see<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart josh is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and</font>

126
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">make these updates is there anyone that</font>

127
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,490
has any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other comments to make beyond</font>

128
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,620
those that were raised at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

129
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,470
meeting I think we're a fairly clear

130
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,520
with in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of what Stewart needed to</font>

131
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:11,770
do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think he's fairly clear it now be a</font>

132
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:14,410
good time to mention it Ted um so I was

133
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I didn't actually hear any feedback</font>

134
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,630
about whether the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question of</font>

135
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,990
whether human readable names could be

136
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:25,300
put into the into into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main forward</font>

137
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,480
zone using txt records or whether we

138
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:33,910
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to have three zones I just</font>

139
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:38,800
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that get addressed like no we should</font>

140
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:40,870
talk yep and is the mtns hybrid

141
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,760
presentation that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have on the list</font>

142
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:48,130
this or well so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no presentation</font>

143
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,560
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide just a state where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

144
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,560
are and that we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an update soon</font>

145
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:59,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's where we are with hybrid</font>

146
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,600
proxy next we've got a short

147
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
presentation from taiwan<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns push</font>

148
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,560
hopefully clarify where we are in terms

149
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,560
of things being split out a bit there

150
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got to</font>

151
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,680
stand in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the square hello I don't think</font>

152
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,630
the clicker will work because it's um

153
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:39,859
auf meiner les jeux it happens to have

154
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:41,750
his magic thing with him here yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

155
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:50,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it was stuck in the end here I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

156
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:52,430
fell sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks Jax on well</font>

157
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,600
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will work but after look</font>

158
00:11:52,430 --> 00:12:02,510
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go I could you just bottom</font>

159
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:08,330
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> close it okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

160
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:12,200
ITF ray and Sarah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alison and John</font>

161
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:14,450
kind of approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I about some</font>

162
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,280
of the work we're doing with put looked

163
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,210
a lot like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they needed for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

164
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,370
things and so they asked if we wanted to

165
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,110
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get together and see if we could</font>

166
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:29,960
come out something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would work for</font>

167
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:33,620
both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us there's an initial draft it's</font>

168
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:37,090
out there and we've had a good design

169
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,770
meeting this time we kind of defined

170
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:43,610
that or you know what a session is we

171
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:47,540
consider to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a long-lived series of</font>

172
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:52,130
DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries either side can initiate it</font>

173
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:54,560
doesn't and get a response and the

174
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:58,180
messages are should be arriving in the

175
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:03,380
same order they were sent so if you can

176
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:07,459
if that seems to apply in our case we're

177
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,860
using TCP over TLS and there may be

178
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,780
other transports that apply that as well

179
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,870
but we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dictate what</font>

180
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:18,560
transports you use it's just that those

181
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:21,590
are properties are well you know kind of

182
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,390
match our use case if anyone has<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

183
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:26,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions do come up at any time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

184
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:32,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">eat white sedan so we're clever in with</font>

185
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:35,990
them on this this allows us instead of

186
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:42,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">having per packet signaling messages</font>

187
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:45,440
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EDS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 keep-alive options we can</font>

188
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,670
do it for the whole session set it up

189
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:56,900
and then we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do the extra</font>

190
00:13:49,670 --> 00:14:01,969
options in every packet so that work is

191
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:04,699
progressing and we should have a new new

192
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,390
draft out soon based on the discussions

193
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,520
that we had there's our there's a

194
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:15,620
terminate message already<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there and</font>

195
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:20,510
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use that directly we may end up</font>

196
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:22,430
with our own keep our own formats for

197
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,170
subscribe<font color="#CCCCCC"> unsubscribe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we confirm</font>

198
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,329
or we may be able to incorporate those

199
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,680
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> session signaling as well</font>

200
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:34,040
that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart and I are gonna</font>

201
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:35,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at sea one advantage is that</font>

202
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,199
session signaling is going to have its

203
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:42,770
own opcode and can define its own packet

204
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,860
types and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring you back on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

205
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:49,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that reduces the number of op codes</font>

206
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,900
that we use but that's just bits on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

207
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:59,450
wire and we're more concerned about

208
00:14:50,900 --> 00:15:01,280
whether it fits in right there's with

209
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,580
the new opcode there's the ability to

210
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:08,480
define entirely new packet format that's

211
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,660
optimal for the TL vs that that we would

212
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,680
like in session signaling

213
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,870
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> session</font>

214
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">singling group is we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to figure</font>

215
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:21,430
out what the optimal case there isn't

216
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,430
the next draft will have that work out

217
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,570
so we hope to have a new draft out soon

218
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,970
of the session<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling then we'll</font>

219
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,070
update the push draft to reflect all

220
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,560
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes that the general</font>

221
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:38,000
architecture push isn't changing this is

222
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:41,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to encode the messages</font>

223
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,560
and so I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've done a</font>

224
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:48,070
implementation but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it's</font>

225
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,359
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really change much for you so</font>

226
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:53,839
but there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a different way to</font>

227
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:57,350
encode these messages on the wire so

228
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:01,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">question send them the Stewart and I do</font>

229
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:04,730
we have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions on the approaching</font>

230
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:08,180
so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current dns push</font>

231
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:10,310
draft I think version 8 that as tom says

232
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,370
is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> significantly reworked</font>

233
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,540
once these signaling stuff stabilizes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

234
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:19,990
think there's still some discussion

235
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:23,390
happening there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stewart has a comment</font>

236
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:25,220
mr. Churchill yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to clarify we're</font>

237
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,770
not expecting the semantics to change

238
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,510
the syntax will be modified<font color="#CCCCCC"> to comply</font>

239
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,819
with the new session signaling draft but

240
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:38,029
the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is trying to achieve is</font>

241
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:40,370
not going to change the question was

242
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:43,070
when will the new draft come out are we

243
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:46,370
we had a long meeting discussed<font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss</font>

244
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:49,760
session<font color="#CCCCCC"> signaling here at the ITF my</font>

245
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:53,089
plan is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to update that documents on my</font>

246
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">flight back on Saturday and then if my</font>

247
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:58,520
co-authors approve it will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

248
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,260
session signaling draft done and give

249
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,520
that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of weeks for people to</font>

250
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,829
look at it and if people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are comfortable</font>

251
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,439
that direction will then update the push

252
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:09,819
draft to adopt the new syntax of the

253
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,819
session signaling mechanism

254
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:19,388
ah yes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it</font>

255
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:20,859
done on the flight back because I do

256
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:24,938
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to have the discussion fairly</font>

257
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:26,859
quickly but not before sunday so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah</font>

258
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:33,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about adoption so</font>

259
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:33,360
that won't happen just yet right

260
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">juvenile Russia gonna talk about maybe</font>

261
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:40,809
get something out sooner than that so

262
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:43,840
it's like on some cycles we now believe

263
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:48,908
so wow ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's high priority for us</font>

264
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,889
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right thank you ok so we have</font>

265
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:52,749
forward movement and I think we have

266
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:54,879
agreement on how things are being split

267
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:57,299
so that's what we were happy to make

268
00:17:54,879 --> 00:18:12,719
sure that we had today that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news</font>

269
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:16,749
so where are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

270
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,509
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ted's you just sent the slides</font>

271
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:25,929
yeah have them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to move</font>

272
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:31,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to yours see how that goes not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

273
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:35,039
well you may I got the title on I

274
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:37,509
apologize that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok let's simple magic</font>

275
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,940
make a full screen thing maybe it's just

276
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:43,990
that why would you see if I've got the

277
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:47,940
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I got it I can and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see you'll</font>

278
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">need the dongle as well oh right</font>

279
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">side it's their party on so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

280
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:09,980
actually a somewhat miss titled slide

281
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,590
the intended use case for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right now</font>

282
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the motivating use case is home net so</font>

283
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,168
that's why the slide is or was formerly

284
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:22,249
titled<font color="#CCCCCC"> or death back when it was on the</font>

285
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:27,440
screen in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the good old days so hardware</font>

286
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:36,019
problem and I can see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you marrying</font>

287
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">properly there yes no yes this excellent</font>

288
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:45,859
rule alright so step back for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

289
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:47,359
bit yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so the the motivating</font>

290
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:50,178
use case for this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to be</font>

291
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:53,210
able to use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like mdns DNS SD</font>

292
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:56,749
hybrid on a home net but mdns<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS SD</font>

293
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,369
hybrid presumes<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially a managed</font>

294
00:19:56,749 --> 00:20:01,460
network with an understandable network

295
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:05,629
topology and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not</font>

296
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:07,369
characteristic of home that's so people

297
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:09,080
are going to plug I mean anybody who's

298
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:11,480
been to the house of somebody who is not

299
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,189
a network expert who has a home net or a

300
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,690
home network with more more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

301
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,840
router knows that they just plug them in

302
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,489
together randomly and that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

303
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sense to the end user</font>

304
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:25,039
when they see the results of that random

305
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:31,039
connecting of the network so in order to

306
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:32,749
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work we the I shouldn't say we</font>

307
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,259
essentially I've been doing all of this

308
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:38,480
work and then I encourage people to

309
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:42,830
participate and throw tomatoes and so

310
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,359
forth but anyway I have been come other

311
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:48,379
the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I that I thought made</font>

312
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:50,899
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most sense was to was to have the</font>

313
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:53,840
the home net essentially have a local

314
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:55,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS zone that has all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the names in it</font>

315
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,428
at least that's what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should look like</font>

316
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,439
to the end user that's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

317
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:04,070
different than the DNS SD hybrid model

318
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:07,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SD hybrid model has what looks</font>

319
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,428
like a zone for every link actually

320
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,049
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> zones for</font>

321
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:15,240
we need to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and uh it's a</font>

322
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:17,519
really neat solution it<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically works</font>

323
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,559
by triggering if you do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS query that</font>

324
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,470
triggers n DNS queries which answer the

325
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:25,049
questions and if you're using DNS push

326
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,659
than you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> better results very nice</font>

327
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:32,749
system which for the most part I think

328
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:36,600
we should also use on home nets and but

329
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:43,169
and it also does support I think caching

330
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:45,149
that doesn't require it so the ID on

331
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:46,320
home that's is is that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got a</font>

332
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:47,668
home that in order to make the network

333
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,918
make sense we actually need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a</font>

334
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:51,149
cache that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the information we've</font>

335
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,499
learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the network we need to be a</font>

336
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:55,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more proactive in learning</font>

337
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:56,909
information about the network which

338
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:59,189
means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sit there and</font>

339
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:00,960
listen for you know when an mdns device

340
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,879
is powered on it announces that it

341
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,009
exists that's the last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear</font>

342
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it unless you wish you a query so</font>

343
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:07,919
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to track that we want to track</font>

344
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,959
what happens when people make queries

345
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,220
and so forth we don't want to reveal a

346
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:16,710
topology in order to not reveal the

347
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,570
topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why wydn SSD hybrid</font>

348
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,460
reveals the topology is because it

349
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,869
eliminates the the conflict problem the

350
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,940
naming conflict problem if you have two

351
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:26,369
devices on two different links with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

352
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,519
same name they don't have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

353
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:32,100
because there's a there's an additional

354
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,309
name interpose that that identifies the

355
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:37,289
link and so you just have printer a on

356
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:39,178
link a and printer a on link be and

357
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:41,070
there's no naming conflict it's a little

358
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">confusing maybe but there's our naming</font>

359
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,779
conflicts so that's that's a good thing

360
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,039
but link a and Link be aren't going to

361
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:49,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">make any sense to an end use if they</font>

362
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,169
don't know what those links are in a

363
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,789
home net in a like at a college you know

364
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:55,259
the link link a might be might have a

365
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,320
name that the administrator put in it

366
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:01,320
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually makes real sense that's</font>

367
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,240
not going to be the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so to</font>

368
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,408
handle the duplicate problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

369
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,749
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this a lot and this is</font>

370
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:09,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much a work in progress and I'm</font>

371
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">open to alternative suggestions the</font>

372
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:14,820
various things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've considered have</font>

373
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:18,059
been just essentially taking the

374
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:20,668
duplicates from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mtns database or</font>

375
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:22,470
from the M DNS queries and adding a

376
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:24,929
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifier the</font>

377
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,870
that's like a number that represents the

378
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:30,110
link my current feeling about this is

379
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:33,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do is actually</font>

380
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:36,360
cross defend once so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so suppose</font>

381
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:39,780
some some device comes up on link a and

382
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,668
says hi I'm printer one and then some

383
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,129
device comes up on like B and says hi

384
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:46,500
I'm crater one<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the home that will</font>

385
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,470
defend that name against the second

386
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,380
printer and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things will</font>

387
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:56,400
happen either assuming no attackers

388
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:59,520
which it's a home net I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever so</font>

389
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,280
either both printers will change their

390
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,679
name or only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one will and the case where</font>

391
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,629
only one does it was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

392
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,929
different devices in the case where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

393
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:14,370
both do it's the same device this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my</font>

394
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">theory so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the nice thing about</font>

395
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:20,908
this as compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding on some names</font>

396
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:24,480
in the in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS view of vm dns</font>

397
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:25,950
name space is that now the names are

398
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,049
consistent when you see them in the user

399
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,850
interface so if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a user</font>

400
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:32,070
interface on your on your Apple that's

401
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,530
telling you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access file sharing</font>

402
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,850
or the web server on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your on your on</font>

403
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,070
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple computer or something like</font>

404
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:41,039
that the name that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see will actually</font>

405
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:46,908
work both for EM dns lookups and for

406
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:49,408
home net lookups at least in theory so

407
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:54,570
anyway I just thought of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem with</font>

408
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:57,919
that yeah which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dot local and</font>

409
00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:01,559
home that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not the same string but</font>

410
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,049
you know life is full of tragedies so

411
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:05,250
anyway as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see this is this is</font>

412
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:08,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much a work in progress that needs</font>

413
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:10,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">work but the idea is that we keep a real</font>

414
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:14,970
DNS zone with forward reverse lookup

415
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:19,320
information and that can be securely

416
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:22,409
updated using DNS updates or if there's

417
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,720
if the if the service doesn't support

418
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:29,039
doing secure updates or just have to be

419
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,390
signed with 60 then it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do the</font>

420
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,039
update on the local wire and we

421
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically treat it as just as</font>

422
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:35,929
trustworthy as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> mdns advertisement</font>

423
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,789
which is to say

424
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:42,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">no what are you gonna do so and then but</font>

425
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,629
we give priority to names in the DNS

426
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,159
zone so if some if we have a device

427
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:48,139
that's publishing its name in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

428
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,879
and then some other device<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes along</font>

429
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:54,769
and publishes a name using mdns then the

430
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:56,178
home<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will defend the name so that</font>

431
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:57,320
the second device that came<font color="#E5E5E5"> along</font>

432
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,549
because in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> case we know they're</font>

433
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,019
different devices because one of them

434
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:07,100
supports<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS updates and one of them</font>

435
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:08,629
does it so so in that case the the home

436
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that will defend that name using mdns</font>

437
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:11,869
and presumably the second device will

438
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:15,559
get a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and everything look</font>

439
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:16,999
good if you want to do queries if you

440
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:23,230
want to do service discovery on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the home</font>

441
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:25,340

442
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,929
so home net router is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

listening on port 53 for both tcp and

448
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:48,470
UDP whether it has a resolver in it is

449
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:50,590
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but every home that has</font>

455
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:09,230
just forward the queries to that router

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:10,549
or to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> device so if you do a DNS</font>

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the DNS zone and out of mdns I</font>

459
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,449
think that the way to make this work is

460
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:21,799
to have / link cache of em DNS data

461
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:26,029
which would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have actually three sort of</font>

462
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:27,200
pseudo zones in it um I just that

463
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:28,730
question occurred to me kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

464
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,840
order i need these slides up about two

465
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:34,549
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so a couple open questions</font>

466
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,379
you know how they're they're open issues

467
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:38,720
with the name name claiming stuff and

468
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:43,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a I'm no longer convinced that</font>

469
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:46,129
it works but but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one question to</font>

470
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,320
answer another question is do we

471
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:49,260
maintain a DNS zone that has everything

472
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,990
in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font>

473
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,060
serial number my original when I

474
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,250
originally thought this through the

475
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">design was that it would in fact have a</font>

476
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:03,570
serial number and would contain all the

477
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:06,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">mtns data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that works best but</font>

478
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,399
it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement so</font>

479
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,960
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade-off to be made there the</font>

480
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,210
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the reason why works best is</font>

481
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,030
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> now if you do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS update the</font>

482
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:17,040
data from mdns is there and can be can

483
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:21,660
be seen by the update query so updates

484
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:23,430
have predicates sand and if you if you

485
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,630
put in a predicate you'd like it if if

486
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:29,940
so if a host tries to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

487
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:32,910
but only<font color="#CCCCCC"> if something else is true we'd</font>

488
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,230
like that predicate actually work so

489
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's kind of the motivation for that</font>

objecting to ugly host names is that

what you're no no no I'm rejecting too

507

objecting to that is not because it's

510
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,200
inherently bad it's not it actually

how DNS SD works that's certainly one

564
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:51,539
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> right for those examples perhaps</font>

565
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:55,169
the the fact that the hybrid proxy

566
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:57,990
solution injects this extra revelation

567
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:59,690
of the topology is is irrelevant but I

568
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:02,429
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about I'm that's</font>

569
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,899
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I could drink a lot of beer</font>

570
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:07,080
arguing about yeah discussing this

571
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:09,209
vociferous Lee up but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's</font>

572
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,699
a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to answer yeah you</font>

573
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:15,720
know what's the answer one answer to

574
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is is a let's do plan a which is</font>

575
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">reveal the topology</font>

576
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:25,800
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can we can add</font>

577
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,800
later a way of unrevealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topology</font>

578
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:31,909
my only and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't see any</font>

579
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:37,080
particular downside to that um and maybe

580
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:39,960
it's not worth so there's someone behind

581
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,000
you who just just went like this when I

582
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,860
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so maybe he has a strong but</font>

583
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,390
he doesn't he cares about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full</font>

584
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,919
domain names that are revealed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

585
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:49,890
not sure that everybody does that's thus

586
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,790
the underlying well question the thing

587
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,500
the thing that I think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

588
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">important to keep in mind is that in the</font>

589
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,220
ITF we have this idea that<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users are</font>

590
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,690
completely stupid no I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

591
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think but they have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

592
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,620
idea of what they're looking for

593
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,229
everywhere every user has a different

594
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,540
idea of what they're looking for and

595
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,890
what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is is make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

596
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,570
case that what we present is is

597
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,340
understandable and as simple as possible

598
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,110
without being so simple that it actually

599
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,209
becomes more complex which is all kind

600
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,719
of problem it actually might might be

601
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:20,670
worthwhile to<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh run some experiments</font>

602
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,920
yeah you know to actually do some demos

603
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:25,020
to see here's here's a here's a hybrid

604
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,600
proxy deployment and and here's what

605
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,330
happens when i connect my iOS device

606
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,580
onto the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first SSID on this little this</font>

607
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:35,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">little home network deployment with</font>

608
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,409
these ugly names and see where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

609
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,570
get the host names and I mean I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font>

610
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:42,210
the servants in service instance names

611
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:45,419
and where i get actually the the full

612
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:47,910
ugly names and and see what's tolerable

613
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:50,100
and what's not yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

614
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,680
problem is i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really don't know what</font>

615
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,110
we would put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in those names put in well</font>

616
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:58,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've spent a little time reading the HNC</font>

617
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:00,689
p document recently some of you may be

618
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,400
aware of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that we're bitter yeah</font>

619
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,930
I'm not bitter on the bitter but I have

620
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,150
been spending a lot of time trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

621
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:09,870
read it yeah and there is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

622
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:12,480
there about having that<font color="#CCCCCC"> h NCP routers</font>

623
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:15,330
are required to assign a name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some</font>

624
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,510
sort to every link yes so if that's

625
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:20,159
already happening then that's yes but

626
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,710
what does that name look like I and

627
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,830
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming full circle because I claim</font>

628
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:28,199
I don't care even I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care well</font>

629
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,819
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody idealist</font>

630
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,779
the service instances doesn't care it

631
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,159
could be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> uuid</font>

632
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,409
you could be an interface name<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

633
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so and by the way they're never</font>

634
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:40,770
going to show up that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole point</font>

635
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:42,240
yes they will so so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppose</font>

636
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,350
you have printer<font color="#E5E5E5"> a on Elena's one we're</font>

637
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,428
going to art we're gonna we're not going

638
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,290
to settle that argument about whether I

639
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:47,490
even show up or not by arguing about it

640
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:52,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">well because you folks are wrong and</font>

641
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:54,060
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not listening to me we do need to</font>

642
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,830
run some experiments to stand so so but

643
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,170
let's do this with some ugly names on

644
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,310
some links and and pop up the interfaces

645
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,020
and see what they look like yeah I mean

646
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">forgive me but but what you just said</font>

647
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,470
slightly trivializes the conversation

648
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,840
though because it's pretty clear that

649
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:09,689
the names will show up because if you've

650
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,040
got a printer on on on link a and the

651
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">st. and a printer with the same name on</font>

652
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,779
unlink be right you're gonna see the

653
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,670
name there's no way to avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

654
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,610
that's part of the design<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

655
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now it may be that that never</font>

656
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:26,040
happens in which case we're fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

657
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,690
happened to a sense of subject an email

658
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,090
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> precise subjects the open a list</font>

659
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:33,950
within the last hour without much chair

660
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:37,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">hassle these said these names do appear</font>

661
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:40,770
not every device<font color="#CCCCCC"> accessed via</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bonjour</font>

00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:49,830
that dot local name from you yeah I have

665
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:52,140
two devices on my home you know one of

666
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:55,980
theirs and ours which is primarily

667
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,359
accessed as yet nazdar local and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

668
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,490
management is that is done via a web

670
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,970
that I don't want that bookmark to

671
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,440
changed in or which particular segment

673
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,030

674
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,609
issue which will be not get hung up on

675
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,620
just the human readability aspect of

676
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,750
this but has also views the subsequent

677
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,279
usability of these names<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as I'm</font>

678
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,740
concerned the namespace should be flat

679
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,000
and it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be persistent unless</font>

680
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,430
except in the event of there being a

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,530
collision yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep I don't want to have</font>

682
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,899
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and read it all of my bookmarks in</font>

smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> bonjour style yeah and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too fast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

what we're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> other way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry say</font>

686
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,920
what we're getting here are some

687
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,600
indications of requirements are actually

688
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,700
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet here right it might be</font>

689
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,170
worth capturing those is yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

690
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,460
everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in your Hector's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,460
that offers now it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good point</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Stewart cheshire actually have a quick</font>

00:36:49,100 --> 00:37:04,339
you using the ones the pipe of an ISP oh

695
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:05,750
I can assure indoors unite explorer 6 so

696
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds like it's not Chrome or</font>

697
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:12,170
Firefox or Safari or Internet Explorer

698
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:14,440
it's some other web browser really<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud</font>

699
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:18,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">of our session I think so much grabs it</font>

700
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so so what I hear there is is a call</font>

701
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,700
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chrome web browser to have a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have to bookmark them is that correct</font>

704
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:31,460
say yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm aware that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> such a thing has</font>

705
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:35,000
existed at times or<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact does is</font>

706
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:40,520
enable<font color="#E5E5E5"> dab'll yes I'm more of that but</font>

707
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">not all browsers do yes a little private</font>

708
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,940
go I'm painfully aware that Safari is

709
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,890
the only browse that has a pulldown menu

710
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:49,370
of marshal services and it's a thorn in

711
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:50,960
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> site so moving on listening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to all</font>

712
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:53,359
the people who came to the microphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

713
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,880
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself sort of three-quarters</font>

714
00:37:53,360 --> 00:38:03,710
agreeing with everybody it's like a big

715
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:05,450
Venn diagram one point that is maybe my

716
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:07,210
failing for not communicating it more

717
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:10,339
clearly is that the hybrid proxy

718
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:13,310
document is intended as a building block

719
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:16,610
very large a solution it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not by</font>

720
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:18,820
itself the total answer and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

721
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:21,290
head but it's not written down anywhere

722
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,050
Ralph has already suggested that we need

723
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:26,300
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of bcp or deployment advice or</font>

724
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,850
some kind of guidance for how you build

725
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,530
a system using these building blocks and

726
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:36,880
that's that's a gap<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have right</font>

727
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:36,880
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I actually agree with you that</font>

728
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:45,140
the final solution that we put together

729
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:47,120
should hide these link names part of

730
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:50,930
that is a question of you I that we

731
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,910
don't design in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IETF I agree with</font>

732
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:55,040
what ralph said that part of this

733
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,839
process is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should take a look at the</font>

734
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,200
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I that exists in various</font>

735
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,660
bits

736
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,640
software and see how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> handles this and</font>

737
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,160
displays it because the display is not

738
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,640
uniform and consistent for instance

739
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">Safari will just display the instance</font>

740
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:16,160
name as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it's unique but if it</font>

741
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:19,760
finds a<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAS device on two different</font>

742
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,950
subnets then or two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> subdomains</font>

743
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,170
it will put the subdomain name in

744
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:26,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">parenthesis after the device so you'll</font>

745
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,770
have mass device or you'll have nasty

746
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,440
fights brackets<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet NAS device</font>

747
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:32,210
brackets Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not advocating that</font>

748
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,370
because that's full of<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems because</font>

749
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:40,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you call your device nas device</font>

750
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:41,540
brackets Wi-Fi then but the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

751
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,319
that is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Safari engineers</font>

752
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,940
came up with and other tools that the UI

753
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:50,420
is not consistent and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make things</font>

754
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:53,020
even worse once we roll out this hybrid

755
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:56,270
proxy stuff and it becomes widespread

756
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,310
those application developers may well go

757
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:01,550
and update their you ice in response to

758
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:03,620
that so that's a moving target<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it</font>

759
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:07,130
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a complicated situation right</font>

760
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:08,750
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was all sort of to</font>

761
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,070
acknowledge the various points that have

762
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:14,060
been made because there's truth in all

763
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:17,150
of them I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work with you on</font>

764
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,190
on the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> your writing and if</font>

765
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:22,460
anybody else we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a design team</font>

766
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:24,890
because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

767
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:26,750
beyond what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we currently have and puts</font>

768
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,339
them together that's usable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we want</font>

769
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to work because we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it</font>

770
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,180
at Apple when I a new headquarters

771
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:36,050
building opens up we want all this stuff

772
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,730
deployed and working so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me just</font>

773
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:39,320
say that having listened to you say that

774
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:43,970
I realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I actually made the</font>

775
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:45,530
complete wrong slide deck because the

776
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:47,450
sales pitch that I really want to give

777
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:49,280
here is the sales pitch<font color="#E5E5E5"> for we need to</font>

778
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:53,540
replace mdns with something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

779
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,490
on larger networks and which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

780
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,670
think is controversial maybe I'm wrong

781
00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:00,319
um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mdns works really</font>

782
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:03,710
well on a single wire I mean it's great

783
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:06,500
it everything works but what we really

784
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:10,190
ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS updates because DNS</font>

785
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,880
updates are not linked local and so what

786
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,890
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font>

787
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,529
is to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these printers that</font>

788
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:17,868
you buy send a DNS update with some

789
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:19,339
security payload that allows the printer

790
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:20,779
once the name has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been established</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

791
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:24,609
defend it so that that name never

792
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:27,170
changes again because that way the the

793
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:28,730
the use case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ray's talking about</font>

794
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:31,009
works and it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter what the UI</font>

795
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:33,680
is and that's really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I care about</font>

796
00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:38,210
so so the whole point of this is to

797
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:41,210
create a context<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which there is an</font>

798
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,829
incentive<font color="#CCCCCC"> for printer manufacturers to</font>

799
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,599
do something other and and for

800
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:47,299
everything that now as manufacturers

801
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:49,460
whatever to do something other than mdns

802
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:53,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you know you have dns update in</font>

803
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:55,190
RFC 67-63<font color="#CCCCCC"> I foresee several biz in a</font>

804
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:57,519
future Ted what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I foresee</font>

805
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:00,109
several PS well we have we've cried in

806
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:03,348
beers in your case and so does in my

807
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:05,359
case over many a time in the past on

808
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:07,130
this so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> news but but the point</font>

809
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,930
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it would be nice if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had it</font>

810
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,609
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not even asking people</font>

811
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:13,879
to do something differently it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

812
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:16,990
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok thanks I'll make one</font>

813
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,039
quick final comment to raise points<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

814
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:22,098
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with what you're asking</font>

815
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,660
for I just don't know how we do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

816
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:26,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general case and what a what I'm</font>

817
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:29,089
talking that is if my NASA's on Wi-Fi

818
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:31,069
and I decide to run a gigabit ethernet

819
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:33,170
cable to it because it's that because

820
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:35,630
it's faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> I completely agree with you</font>

821
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:38,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would like the name to not change out</font>

822
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:41,900
like the bookmarks to not change but how

823
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:44,119
far do we take that if i take the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nas to</font>

824
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,130
my office and plug it in there should my

825
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,579
bookmark at home still work because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

826
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,900
implies global naming and so search so

827
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:53,119
when you say you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move it without</font>

828
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,759
the name changing the question is how

829
00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:03,130
far can you move it before the name has

830
00:42:55,759 --> 00:43:06,529
to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I actually I actually</font>

831
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:08,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">deleted from the last slide a question</font>

832
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:10,759
why did<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kerry put his head in his hands</font>

833
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,309
at the end of my talk about this in Home

834
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:15,109
net I felt that that didn't really

835
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">belong on the slide but but you know</font>

837
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,180
as a general comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel like we must</font>

838
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,890
have missed

thing during the requirements gathering

840
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:32,700
phase of this exercise so I'm expecting

841
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,170
a response or anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it would</font>

I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something you said in</font>

845
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,609
passing which was we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get printer</font>

846
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:47,069
manufacturers to do something other than

847
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:48,779
mdns there's like millions upon millions

848
00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:50,369
of printers already in the field that

849
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">you then it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to write a strand</font>

850
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:55,440
all that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work yeah yeah so</font>

851
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:57,779
absolutely but<font color="#E5E5E5"> my real question is are</font>

852
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,880
you assuming that the capability to

853
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,319
change an instance name doesn't exist or

854
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the users won't know how to use</font>

855
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:06,808
that the capability to change an

856
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:09,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance name of a device well no I mean</font>

857
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:10,230
devices have user interfaces for typing

858
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,970
and names frequently I mean not

859
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,710
necessarily always so then if the two

860
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">names you know show up in the same</font>

861
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:19,140
namespace well so there isn't you there

862
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,808
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> and dissing disambiguate those two</font>

863
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,910
names so that never happens again so so

864
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:25,980
in order for that to so there's two ways

865
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:29,848
that that can work one is that the name

866
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:32,579
is a dependable that is to say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

867
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:33,720
going to change over again assuming you

868
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:35,160
know that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get rid of that</font>

869
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,750
printer or whatever but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as long as</font>

870
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that printer still lives on your network</font>

871
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:42,359
it's always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same name</font>

872
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:44,970
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that assumption then the</font>

873
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:46,650
UI can just put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different name on the</font>

874
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,140
printer there are a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues with</font>

875
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one is if you do that in the UI on</font>

876
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,520
one laptop and you don't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the UI</font>

877
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:54,990
on another now you've got to you is

878
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,490
showing a different name for the same

879
00:44:54,990 --> 00:45:00,450
object you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so what you</font>

880
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:02,729
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want is a way to is a way to have</font>

881
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,919
a UI so when you when you when you go to

882
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:08,010
your UI in chrome you can you can click

883
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,740
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing or in in Safari or whatever</font>

884
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:12,450
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> click on the object and you get</font>

885
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,578
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> cursor in it in a text field</font>

886
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can edit the text field and then</font>

887
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:19,970
when you're done editing the text field

888
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:22,859
some message goes out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire and as</font>

889
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:27,450
a result of that the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that object</font>

890
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:30,930
is permanently changed and ideally you

891
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:35,368
want that change request to go all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

892
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:37,430
way to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> object right so well that's</font>

893
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:38,930
this new API that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're suggest not</font>

894
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:41,598
I mean we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we're not going to do</font>

895
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:44,089
the API well but but but is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font>

896
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,069
for us to do that with existing mdns I

897
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:47,630
think the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no right there's</font>

898
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:49,040
generally a way to do it with an

899
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing prayer you're just basically</font>

900
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,390
you know right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't every</font>

901
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:55,279
printer has its own management API or

902
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:57,109
its own management you are yet to by

903
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,630
finding the prayer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then going to</font>

904
00:45:57,109 --> 00:46:02,180
port 80 at that address yeah that's

905
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:03,950
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I mean from a usability</font>

906
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,690
perspective that's better than nothing

907
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,859
at all but it's not a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than</font>

908
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,390
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so then an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

909
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:11,150
question you're assuming that user is

910
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,529
too stupid to use it basically I'm not

911
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,180
assuming the user is too stupid to use

912
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:15,260
it i'm assuming this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the user is not</font>

913
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,328
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to figure out how to</font>

914
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,200
get to it or it's likely that the user

915
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:20,450
are going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out how</font>

916
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:23,960
to get to it so one more conference

917
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:27,618
chair then we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move on all right</font>

918
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this quick it sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

919
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:32,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're proposing Ted is something</font>

920
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:36,680
like an SNMP set operation for some

921
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:39,589
standardized mechanism for set the name

922
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,419
of a device and i'm actually not saying

923
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:43,160
that advocated i'm saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to kind</font>

924
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,799
of point out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know maybe it's</font>

925
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,899
never going it's a hard problem that i

926
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:50,680
would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some standardized</font>

927
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:53,839
network protocol for set name of device

928
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:56,960
I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how we'd get anybody</font>

929
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:59,540
to adopt it yeah the reality is what

930
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">Carrie says that almost all devices have</font>

931
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:05,329
some web UI with something buried in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

932
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:08,410
settings where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put in the name it is</font>

933
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:14,270
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> frustrating it's hard to find</font>

934
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:15,828
it's very inconsistent I i recently

935
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,690
bought a new house<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been buying</font>

936
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:19,280
amplifiers for the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

937
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:21,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually been really gratifying to me</font>

938
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost every device i bought has a</font>

939
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">bonjour advertised web UI on it in fact</font>

940
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,410
really surprising<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't searching for</font>

941
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:30,650
that that wasn't my litmus test whether

942
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:32,299
i buy a product the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest once</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font>

943
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,309
was in two inverters for the solar

944
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:36,349
panels on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roof there is no way to</font>

945
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:41,750
change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> name but that's okay because</font>

946
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:44,140
one of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called SMA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1999 000 45 46</font>

947
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:47,720
and the other one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> called SMA 199 00</font>

948
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:49,750
00 5082 so no need to chose are very

949
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,810
easy to tell apart at a glance

950
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:55,150
this is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a this is so I'm</font>

951
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:57,549
agreeing with you yeah what we need I

952
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:59,080
would love the products to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better I</font>

953
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,030
don't know how we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the products we</font>

954
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,560
better accept that if there's more

955
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:04,270
people using them in complaining that

956
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,700
the heart used and the vendors will have

957
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:09,009
an incentive to fix them and if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

958
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,500
a way that the vendors can fix them that

959
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,000
is standardized maybe they'll use that

960
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:17,410
instead of inventing some special

961
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,410
snowflake way of doing it maybe final

962
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:23,410
final comment coming up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what can</font>

963
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,149
we do maybe I missed something but your

964
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:27,879
IP addresses have to come from somewhere

965
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:29,850
so this is typical you dhcp server but

966
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,010
when your<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp server you have a way to</font>

967
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:34,630
also assign host names no they don't

968
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:37,360
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be backing away you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

969
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:40,090
assign nice way nice appeared DNS names

970
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,580
via your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP server and typically they</font>

971
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:45,100
get rick is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your dynamic updates to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">UT an assistant only ways and another</font>

973
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,850
point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the use case</font>

974
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nessus do a home in your mech is</font>

975
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:53,230
still home so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the link</font>

976
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,029
name in my name because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like I</font>

977
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,830
don't want to run my backup for my<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

978
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,960
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi if I have in parallel</font>

979
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:01,060
park like over going over Wyatt because

980
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,280
this may be five times the difference in

981
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:05,410
timing which takes it doing this back<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

982
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,020
over Wi-Fi versus wire so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

983
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:11,470
there's some use case in having the link

984
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:12,880
in the name somewhere yeah that actually

985
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:15,910
is a good use case we're having a link

986
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,170
in the name dhcp is not really a<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

987
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:19,330
on home that's maybe if you're using

988
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:23,020
ipv4 but we're not expecting people to

989
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:27,700
do that so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know we should well</font>

990
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:30,310
that was a little bit political yeah I

991
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,960
try to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some I'll be very quick</font>

992
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:34,420
sandwich along time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I hear this</font>

993
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,090
frequently<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Oh dhcp will give you a</font>

994
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:39,280
hostname and I hear this a lot and I've

995
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:40,390
never seen it actually used he<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

996
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,920
actually work because it doesn't

997
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:44,470
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> work because I walk into your</font>

998
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,970
house with an ipad how does the dhcp

999
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,740
server know what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my ipad is</font>

1000
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,120
right it rain and you enter random

1001
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,979
address from the pool but it can't tell

1002
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,319
it what its name is and would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like</font>

1003
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:55,390
it if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipad trusted your dhcp server</font>

1004
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,660
your summer random dhcp server to give

1005
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,660
it a name

1006
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:02,200
so I think what we're hearing is thanks

1007
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:04,660
for doing the work Ted as much

1008
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,399
appreciated clearly Ted needs help

1009
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,649
there's a suggestion of having a design

1010
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,729
team whether formal or informal I think

1011
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,979
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing to do with</font>

1012
00:50:09,729 --> 00:50:12,999
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touch to it ray if they're</font>

1013
00:50:11,979 --> 00:50:15,069
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and any other</font>

1014
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:17,160
volunteers want to come forward there is

1015
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:19,299
does seem to be the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flat homenet</font>

1016
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:22,989
problem that we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve here</font>

1017
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:25,180
but there's also the interweaving of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

1018
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:27,069
update and hybrid proxy and a campus

1019
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:29,529
type environment as well there's two

1020
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:31,058
threads their final question not and if

1021
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:35,410
it's for sure or who it's for but is

1022
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:37,089
Marcus<font color="#CCCCCC"> stenberg in the room no well he's</font>

1023
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:40,359
got a working maybe you can answer this

1024
00:50:37,089 --> 00:50:41,950
way there is a draft Marcus wrote about

1025
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:46,078
hybrid proxy in<font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> net or were you</font>

1026
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:48,308
suggesting that's no longer the way or

1027
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,999
okay all right we'll take that offline

1028
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:56,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">never mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i think the next item</font>

1029
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:59,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">is Ralph to lead a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion on</font>

1030
00:50:56,579 --> 00:51:02,380
son sorry did you have some slides or

1031
00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:04,479
anything ready to you were you're going

1032
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:09,549
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> implemented oh okay</font>

1033
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:11,669
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I did you outside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have slides</font>

1034
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:13,749
I'll walk through what I have to say

1035
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:17,229
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we had what we were</font>

1036
00:51:13,749 --> 00:51:21,549
interested in is your work on Hydra

1037
00:51:17,229 --> 00:51:25,660
proxy implementation but so let me walk

1038
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:28,200
through my slides and then chimed in so

1039
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll take this back</font>

1040
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,379
so what we're talking to here is what

1041
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stuart alluded to with the fact that</font>

1042
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,299
hybrid proxy is a tool that we can use

1043
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,180
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways and the question is</font>

1044
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:50,220
what sort of guidance or best practice

1045
00:51:48,180 --> 00:52:03,569
can we recommend for doing that

1046
00:51:50,220 --> 00:52:06,169
particularly in a campus environment so

1047
00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:08,460
I have nothing like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp document</font>

1048
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:10,319
nothing like laying out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

1049
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,440
possibilities all I want to do today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1050
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:17,009
run through some of the components that

1051
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">make up the building blocks of unicast</font>

1052
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:22,859
DNS SD as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart was alluding to and</font>

1053
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,049
give one small example of how those can

1054
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:27,058
be put together in a in a particularly

1055
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:28,859
in a particular way for stitching the

1056
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:31,980
various zones together to accomplish

1057
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:35,430
particular requirement the idea here is

1058
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:37,500
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart was saying to get to a unicast</font>

1059
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:41,149
DNS SD deployment while still

1060
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:43,319
accommodating multicast DNS devices and

1061
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:46,559
start broadening the way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

1062
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:48,630
these pieces as as as building blocks

1063
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,470
and being able to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> put together in in</font>

1064
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:55,020
lots of clever ways as always since this

1065
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:57,419
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a naming problem there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are lots of</font>

1066
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,890
opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> for doing clever things</font>

1067
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,039
with names and levels of indirection

1068
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:03,808
inside the various<font color="#CCCCCC"> components that we</font>

1069
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:09,180
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really even started to begin</font>

1070
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:09,930
exploring yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so we all know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1071
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,509
stuff I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

1072
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:15,538
everybody's on the same page<font color="#CCCCCC"> dn SSD is</font>

1073
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:17,400
independent of the DNS transport right

1074
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:20,339
you send the same queries over multicast

1075
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,569
DNS as you do over unicast DNS let me

1076
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:23,430
get evaluated the same way you get the

1077
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:24,869
same responses back it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1078
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:30,480
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transport whether it's multicast</font>

1079
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:32,430
DNS or unicast DNS unicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SSD is a</font>

1080
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,549
good thing it avoids the overhead of

1081
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:38,009
multicast DNS I may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> relayed this</font>

antidote before a friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Cisco live where the deployment tends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1085
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:55,529
be a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large bridge</font>

1086
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:58,289
single link in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which there may be as</font>

1087
00:53:55,529 --> 00:54:00,119
many as 10 or 20,000 people and you know

1088
00:53:58,289 --> 00:54:02,880
how we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we probably have three or</font>

1089
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:04,799
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're all</font>

1090
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,519
carrying around at communicating over

1091
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,319
over mdns the traffic the multicast DNS

1092
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:12,299
traffic on that packet capture was

1093
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,890
something like forty percent of the

1094
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:16,890
packets over the period of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1095
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:21,240
looked at it so it's so DNS SD avoids

1096
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:22,769
all that overhead and DNS SD can avoid

1097
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,689
the overhead even if you're some of the

1098
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:27,390
overhead even if you're using multicast

1099
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:30,269
DNS for legacy devices because you don't

1100
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:32,670
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to forward the multicast DNS</font>

1101
00:54:30,269 --> 00:54:35,640
traffic from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legacy devices across</font>

1102
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:37,650
the entire multi-link network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1103
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:41,420
you can isolate it to a single link and

1104
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:45,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">then use unicast DNS in clever ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1105
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:48,089
communicate across to do dns service

1106
00:54:45,029 --> 00:54:50,309
discovery across remote links so some

1107
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:54,288
considerations this is consideration<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

1108
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:57,119
scaling responses to service discovery

1109
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:59,309
it's great if we can we can have a way

1110
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:04,049
of merging together multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns eunuch</font>

location so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a clever way I can</font>

1123
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:36,660
take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SD infrastructure and</font>

1124
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:41,099
structure it in such a way that I get

1125
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:44,509
back just the the responses from devices

1126
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:46,500
that are physically in my vicinity and

1127
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:47,700
as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got to accommodate</font>

1128
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,049
legacy devices this is the conversation

1129
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:52,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">we had at the end of the previous</font>

1130
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:54,059
presentation for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time being we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1131
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:55,740
to accommodate multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS devices</font>

1132
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:58,109
there's there's no way around it we

1133
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:00,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a way of going to entirely</font>

1134
00:55:58,109 --> 00:56:02,808
unique sdn SSD but that would be a great

1135
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,809
goal

1136
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:06,530
excuse me so what what are the tools

1137
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:09,440
involved here what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the building</font>

1138
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:13,369
blocks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can put together in a tip</font>

1139
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,880
to get a emerged unicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SD</font>

1140
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:19,690
multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS DNS SD well first of all</font>

1141
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,560
their duties DNS SD client configuration

1142
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:23,720
resource records there are actually

1143
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:27,250
several of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> magis but one example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

1144
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:29,180
here as an example so and these these

1145
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,430
configuration ours come from a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1146
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:34,399
different places so the idea here is the

1147
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:38,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> device gets its domain name from</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">dns query there's a second kind of query</font>

1152
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:53,960
that's made by taking the subnet that

1153
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:57,290
the device is attached to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the device</font>

00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:01,730
takes its address IP address applies the

1155
00:56:57,290 --> 00:57:05,990
subnet mask and gets a gets a subject

1156
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:09,859
number puts it into IM<font color="#E5E5E5"> a darpa format</font>

1157
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:13,578
and issues that request and then finally

1158
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:17,750
it'll issue an lb request on that local

1159
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:19,099
/ mdns now these responses come back and

1160
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,270
i'll show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how these responses come</font>

1161
00:57:19,099 --> 00:57:21,890
back and get merged together in a second

1162
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,119
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an example but the responses</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll come back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get merged into a</font>

1164
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:32,569
list of a list of it's essentially a

1165
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:34,279
search list for doing dns SD queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1166
00:57:32,569 --> 00:57:38,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next set of tools is the hybrid</font>

1167
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:40,460
proxy servers themselves now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do have a</font>

1168
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,349
pointer the hybrid proxy servers

1169
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:45,069
themselves and then there's the

1170
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:47,000
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SD server or DNS server</font>

1171
00:57:45,069 --> 00:57:48,710
which we're going to use to stitch all

1172
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,819
this stuff together<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the organization</font>

1173
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:54,319
dns<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns server has the unique sdn SSD</font>

1174
00:57:52,819 --> 00:57:58,609
client configuration or ours these

1175
00:57:54,319 --> 00:58:02,150
things it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the delegations from the</font>

1176
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:04,578
central zone for the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1177
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:11,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">hybrid proxy servers and it's got these</font>

1178
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:11,470
these these funny subnet entries<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1179
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,250
so how do we stitch all these things

1180
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,510
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this particular example in</font>

1181
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:25,020
this particular example what I want to

1182
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:27,869
do is show how we can do use hybrid

1183
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:31,140
proxy servers to generate location

1184
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:33,210
dependent search lists so that device

1185
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:34,950
will only get services that are of

1186
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,390
interest based on its location in a

1187
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:39,359
building we got a building with three

1188
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:41,310
floors floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 2 & 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the device is going</font>

1189
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:44,280
to be on one of those floors and it's

1190
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:46,049
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a DNS SD unicast search</font>

1191
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,230
list that depends on which floor it's on

1192
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:53,340
and therefore it will only<font color="#E5E5E5"> search part</font>

1193
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:55,140
of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the available services and</font>

1194
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,460
just look at the adjacent<font color="#E5E5E5"> floors so it's</font>

1195
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:59,730
on floor one it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at floor</font>

1196
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:02,430
one in floor too so we deploy hybrid

1197
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:04,080
proxies on all three floors we put the

1198
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:07,460
delegations of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization servers</font>

1199
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:10,980
and we add these entries for each link

1200
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:14,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we've got the the browsing</font>

1201
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:16,440
domain link for subnet one which I'm

1202
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:18,359
assuming is on floor one and it gives

1203
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:22,700
back to PTR records floor one<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> floor</font>

1204
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:25,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">too that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that any device that's on</font>

1205
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:27,990
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> link which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is on floor one will get</font>

1206
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,340
back this list of to search search

1207
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:31,229
domains did I get that not quite right

1208
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:33,359
no no you got that perfectly right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

1209
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:36,420
wanted to add a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because</font>

00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:46,290
here is not a proposal for what we might

00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">do in the future this is the software</font>

1215
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:50,700
that you all have on your macs and

1216
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:52,710
iphones today and if you hit command<font color="#E5E5E5"> p</font>

00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,390
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> terminal room printer shows up</font>

1218
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:59,160
will you press the air print button on

00:59:54,390 --> 01:00:00,569
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone this is what it's doing right</font>

1220
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,089
that's exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> right in this example</font>

1221
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:04,710
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually bring the</font>

1227
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:21,140
today oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow</font>

1228
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:31,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happens for a</font>

1229
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:35,419
device in a subnet 1 192 168 1 0 which

1230
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:35,419
we assumes as assigned to the 1st floor

sixty eight dot 220 on the second floor

1233
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:51,319
gets all three search domains and then

1234
01:00:49,319 --> 01:00:55,049
the device on the third floor just gets

1235
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:59,640
42 and 43<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when one of these</font>

01:00:55,049 --> 01:01:01,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices now does a you know does it pull</font>

1237
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,839
down to do service discovery it will

1238
01:01:01,769 --> 01:01:05,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">either look at the services on the</font>

1239
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,949
hybrid proxies in floor one in floor two

1240
01:01:05,939 --> 01:01:09,328
if it's on floor two it'll look at the

1241
01:01:07,949 --> 01:01:10,769
hybrid proxies on floor one two and

1242
01:01:09,329 --> 01:01:12,779
three and get all other resources back

1243
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:17,279
that's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> for three it'll just look at</font>

1244
01:01:12,779 --> 01:01:24,179
two and three so the unicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SD</font>

1245
01:01:17,279 --> 01:01:29,189
client on floor one resolves its browser

1246
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:30,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">RR it sends out these queries the</font>

1247
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:33,419
results are merged in the leftmost naval

1248
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,069
labels the instance names are displayed

1249
01:01:33,419 --> 01:01:37,348
and so you'll actually get a little

1250
01:01:35,069 --> 01:01:39,900
pulldown menu that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the printers</font>

on the local link on the dot local link

1252
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:47,039
and on floor one and for two that's

1253
01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:48,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much it that's the that's trying</font>

give you an idea of where<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart and</font>

1256
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:55,140
perhaps tom and i are going to start and

01:01:52,229 --> 01:01:57,109
writing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCP document that lays this</font>

01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:05,130
stitch these things together in in more

1261
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:07,739
clever ways yeah so that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many</font>

1262
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:10,739
pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this puzzle this this is</font>

1263
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:13,289
probably from the configuration from the

1264
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:15,809
administrator of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprises point</font>

1265
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:18,089
of view and what tools they would have

1266
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:19,769
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually put these records in place</font>

1267
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:22,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">of course there's another question</font>

1268
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:23,999
altogether yeah so that's an excellent

1269
01:02:22,709 --> 01:02:25,799
question about what tools the

1270
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:27,359
administrator has to put these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in</font>

1271
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:30,179
place now let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me try two different</font>

1272
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:34,140
scenarios the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> scenario is if</font>

1273
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:35,279
you're considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an enterprise scale</font>

1274
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,790
deployment where you actually have a

1275
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:37,860
real

1276
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">straighter there's still a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1277
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:44,340
opportunity for support tools here so if

1278
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:46,380
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were to buy all of your gear from</font>

1279
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,180
some major router vendor they might give

1280
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:51,000
you some support software that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes</font>

1281
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:52,529
along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that takes a very high</font>

1282
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,540
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> description of the topology of</font>

1283
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:57,720
your building and translates it into all

1284
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,920
the all the detailed little<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns RRS they</font>

1285
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:03,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to go into the enterprise server</font>

1286
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:05,100
that reaches out touches the routers to

1287
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:06,570
configure the hybrid proxy servers and

1288
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,310
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these pieces fit</font>

1289
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:09,930
together in the way you expect right you

1290
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,860
could get not too much of a stretch to

1291
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">say gee I've got this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high level</font>

1293
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:17,129
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll just go push all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

1294
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:20,370
these crazy are ours out and push out

1295
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:21,510
all of the the configuration pieces now

1296
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:24,089
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the home network you</font>

1297
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:28,410
wouldn't probably use this strategy for

1298
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:30,570
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to restrict the search</font>

1299
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:33,470
areas because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

1300
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:35,610
administrator and you don't know that

1301
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:37,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first router is the one that's</font>

1302
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:40,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">downstairs in the basement next to the</font>

1303
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,010
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the DMark where your your</font>

1304
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:45,750
internet comes in on some major<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and</font>

1305
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:47,610
the other router you have is up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1306
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:49,470
Far bedroom corner on the second floor

1307
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,670
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi from the first one</font>

1308
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,140
doesn't quite get around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corner of</font>

1309
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wall in the basement you needed a</font>

1310
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:58,950
second one upstairs so in that case

1311
01:03:54,110 --> 01:04:01,370
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of individual browsing lists for</font>

1312
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:05,189
each individual subnet you just use of a

1313
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:07,319
system-wide browse list for all of the

1314
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:09,150
all the devices in your network

1315
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:11,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody gets the same list of all of</font>

1316
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:14,520
the hybrid proxies in the network and I

1317
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:16,169
can imagine using<font color="#E5E5E5"> H NCP for example to</font>

1318
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:18,440
gather up the names of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

1319
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:21,060
things and use them to inject into the

1320
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,800
DNS server that the DNS resolver that's

1321
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:24,029
that's in your home network so fond<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1322
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,560
that is to avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> being swamped with</font>

1323
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:27,690
responses which would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not happen in our</font>

1324
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">net and young yeah of course right right</font>

1325
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:30,840
right yeah so let's have another<font color="#CCCCCC"> cup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1326
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,770
time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> about five minutes of comments</font>

1327
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,690
before we take this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the list</font>

1328
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:35,400
hopefully this has given the room the

1329
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:37,710
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feel for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of things</font>

1330
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,880
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do here as I think</font>

1331
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:41,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stuart mentioned earlier there are other</font>

1332
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,870
issues like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the UI looks like and</font>

1333
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,520
Ted hinted to that with what he'd like

1334
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:46,560
to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> being able to name devices so</font>

1335
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,880
there are many pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this many of</font>

1336
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,240
which aren't within<font color="#E5E5E5"> our remit to</font>

1337
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,980
actually deal with so

1338
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,839
let's take some questions from the mics

1339
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:56,080
there's two people up there<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got</font>

1340
01:04:52,840 --> 01:05:00,070
time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> about five minutes yeah oh</font>

1341
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:02,170
sorry so go ahead you will remember John

1342
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:04,030
yeah the important<font color="#CCCCCC"> Norton addicting and</font>

1343
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:06,790
I have one yet concern when you're

1344
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:10,920
talking about delegation to the proxy

1345
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:13,090
server instead of update privilege then

1346
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,300
delegation give you permission to do

1347
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:18,490
anything on a debt subdomain including

1348
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:20,020
things that doesn't really make sense in

1349
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:23,229
what we're talking about here like MX

1350
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:24,730
post or domain validation for that

1351
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:29,560
submarine course but still<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font>

1352
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:32,590
rotation and that means maybe the big

1353
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:34,450
thinking like okay so the week at point

1354
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:36,760
in the domain name<font color="#E5E5E5"> song become whatever</font>

1355
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:39,580
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> processor is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laying like maybe floor</font>

1356
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:42,070
one is a reception<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a bank okay that</font>

1357
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:44,710
service now basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the name of</font>

1358
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:49,060
that domain name<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the central domain</font>

1359
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:53,170
name is well protected no safe place but

1360
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:58,740
not that machine so why is the dross GS

1361
01:05:53,170 --> 01:06:01,000
instigation and not just update so i'm

1362
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:03,540
i'm i'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer that right</font>

1363
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,150
now because AI don't know how to and be

1364
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:08,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly the kind of</font>

1365
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:09,730
consideration we want to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

1366
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:11,350
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the long run rather than</font>

1367
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:12,640
trying to worry about the specific

1368
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:14,410
solutions here but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's exactly</font>

1369
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,690
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to walk through</font>

1370
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:19,089
so please make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point to the list so</font>

1371
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:22,810
we make sure that emits its capture so

1372
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:27,609
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has Chavez</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> John cleansing was</font>

1373
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:29,759
it yeah so Tom first and then John so I

1374
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:32,020
wrote a draft that's expired now that

1375
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,520
kind of lists out all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> primers that</font>

1376
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:39,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">you would want to configure for a hybrid</font>

1377
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:42,090
proxy kind of minimal said anyway those

1378
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:45,490
can be configured from either direction

1379
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:49,060
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can configure it at the delegating</font>

1380
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:51,009
server to to get in the hybrid proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1381
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:53,290
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it needs to know from</font>

1382
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:54,940
the delegating server or you can have

1383
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:56,950
the delegating serve or even have the

1384
01:06:54,940 --> 01:07:00,190
hybrid proxy update the delegating

1385
01:06:56,950 --> 01:07:02,000
server and so they're kind of an auto

1386
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:05,060
configuration mode

1387
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,320
and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to make the</font>

1388
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:10,940
distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the two ways you can</font>

1389
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:13,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as far as the previous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1390
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:15,590
about why are you talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1391
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:19,460
delegation server as well each of the

1392
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:21,710
subnets are on a hybrid proxy are truly

1393
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:26,630
delegated and have their own subdomain

1394
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:31,490
name so that's we have to use delegation

1395
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:34,730
in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you know so how do</font>

1396
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:39,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">we bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> John in do we I'm gonna get so</font>

1397
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:45,740
hit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red button mm-hmm ah the magical</font>

1398
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:47,750
red button hi very<font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly first of all</font>

1399
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:50,410
there are a couple inserted a couple of

1400
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:52,880
snarky comments in the jabber log that I

1401
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:56,259
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at it some stage but</font>

1402
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:59,090
are not worth spending time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on today</font>

1403
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:01,060
more important just as an observation

1404
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:03,770
about how complicated the world gets

1405
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:06,170
I've been working with some architects

1406
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:09,050
of the traditional building variety on

1407
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:10,490
on what turns out to be an aspect of

1408
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:14,690
some of the problem you we've been

1409
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:17,210
talking about Ralph and just want to

1410
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:22,100
mention that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the assumptions</font>

1411
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:24,980
you've made in your presentation assume

1412
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:27,380
either that everything is wired or that

1413
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:30,500
when we design buildings and their

1414
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:33,049
interiors are we are going to insist

1415
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:36,080
upon new kinds of carpeting consisting

1416
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:39,979
of a wire mesh which runs edge to<font color="#CCCCCC"> edge</font>

1417
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:42,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">to edge cross room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scanties thoroughly</font>

1418
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:45,439
grounded sufficiently to prevent radio

1419
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:48,649
waves from from moving between floors

1420
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,540
and and I can't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that's going to</font>

1421
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:52,849
happen I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's going to</font>

1422
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:54,470
happen but it's another issue which

1423
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:56,540
increases<font color="#CCCCCC"> the complexity of this problem</font>

1424
01:08:54,470 --> 01:09:00,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">the real world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1425
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:02,720
were nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't go yeah and I</font>

1426
01:09:00,049 --> 01:09:04,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">think from my experience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of managing the</font>

1427
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:06,560
campus environment you and when you do a

1428
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:08,480
campus-wide the point of wireless for

1429
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,460
example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a number of controllers</font>

1430
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,318
and the access points they control can

1431
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:14,359
be anywhere and you have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1432
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,330
VLAN pooling that means you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

1433
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,980
devices in the same

1434
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:18,210
that it's a we need to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all</font>

1435
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:20,669
these things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very good</font>

1436
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">point and please do take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that forward on</font>

1437
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:25,890
the list yeah that's that was a comment

1438
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:28,650
was need to think about it thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ya</font>

1439
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:30,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">thang thanks Johnny and yes I've been</font>

1440
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:32,160
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DA you can come up while</font>

1441
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:33,210
we just finish off injury but I've been

1442
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,559
talking to the wireless folks the

1443
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:36,990
wireless controller folks at cisco to

1444
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,180
understand that world better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1445
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:41,819
currently do and to see how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works in</font>

1446
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:47,160
this context thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you got Daniel</font>

1447
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:50,399
slides on yours might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> quicker now</font>

1448
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:53,309
you're plugged in just take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1449
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:55,139
while we switch over just one thought

1450
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:58,080
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like isn't this a similar</font>

1451
01:09:55,140 --> 01:10:00,480
problem like we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fists a 911</font>

1452
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:03,090
calls location for emergency calls for

1453
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,669
IP telephony so they also have to submit

1454
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:07,980
some kind of a location a or I'm just

1455
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:10,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask things like isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it more or less</font>

1456
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:15,719
the same goal will probably have to

1457
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:17,520
address and so I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer</font>

1458
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,230
see this being a requirement 5p

1459
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:25,170
telephony so where you have to submit

1460
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:28,320
the location for much is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agreed the</font>

1461
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:29,750
similarities and I think likewise we

1462
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:33,150
don't currently have any solutions

1463
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:35,160
because I i I'm not aware of any

1464
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:37,309
technology in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my phone that knows what</font>

1465
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:40,650
floor of the building i'm on right now

1466
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:42,390
gps only works at all outdoors and even

1467
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,920
then not to a sufficient accuracy to

1468
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:47,820
tell you within a<font color="#E5E5E5"> meter where you are</font>

1469
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:52,320
reliably so yeah it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a it's</font>

1470
01:10:47,820 --> 01:11:00,360
an open problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay can we have Daniel</font>

1471
01:10:52,320 --> 01:11:02,759
or Christian thank you so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got 15</font>

1472
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:07,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the presentation and chat so</font>

1473
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:10,050
off you go hello my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is danica I'm a</font>

1474
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:12,990
PhD student at the University of concert

1475
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:16,230
and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present our draft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS st</font>

1476
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:18,599
privacy extensions so the draft is about

1477
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:21,240
the privacy problems arising<font color="#CCCCCC"> and using</font>

1478
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:23,010
dns st and it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives a first</font>

1479
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:25,139
solution which we call a two-stage

1480
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:28,240
solution that it was added in the second

1481
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:31,240
version of the job

1482
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:34,389
first I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the privacy</font>

1483
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:36,849
problem so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume that Ellis and</font>

1484
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:42,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">use an effort and she wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer a</font>

1485
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:44,380
presence<font color="#CCCCCC"> or over that hey hey I don't</font>

1486
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:49,330
know I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> Frank wasn't my fault a</font>

1487
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:58,630
turnover sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow very nice pictures</font>

1488
01:11:49,330 --> 01:12:00,850
from there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I feel so let's assume</font>

1489
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alice wants to offer present service</font>

1490
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:06,790
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> instance used by ichat or</font>

1491
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:08,500
pigeon and during service browsing her

1492
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:10,750
device will offer a point resource

1493
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:12,910
record which looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

1494
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:15,970
tells other devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is a new</font>

1495
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:19,090
service of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> try presents but this</font>

1496
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:21,010
brings the privacy problem of giving a

1497
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:25,410
list of service instances that is

1498
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:27,610
offered<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a device then for service</font>

1499
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:29,530
browsing her device will offer the

1500
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:31,990
corresponding text and service resource

1501
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:33,940
records the service record might look

1502
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:36,580
like this it contains the part of which

1503
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:39,490
the application is listening and the

1504
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:41,470
host name the host name is a privacy

1505
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:44,019
problem especially if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it contains two</font>

1506
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:48,280
users name which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is often on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> default</font>

1507
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:51,730
behavior and the part often identify the

1508
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:53,710
service type then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> text to source</font>

1509
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:56,379
record contains further information

1510
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:59,710
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service and my content private</font>

1511
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:03,100
information like here on the full name

1512
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:05,470
or a chat status and then for host name

1513
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,990
resolution we use the typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a</font>

1514
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:15,370
resource record which again discloses

1515
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:18,460
the hostname so on as a mitigation

1516
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:21,430
technique we propose the two-state

1517
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:23,680
solution which divides the service

1518
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:26,770
discovery process in two stages the

1519
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:29,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">first one is directly discovery and the</font>

1520
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:32,260
second is a service discovery the

1521
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:35,019
motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dividing this is that we</font>

1522
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:37,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to offer services directly to on</font>

1523
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:42,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">piers that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually use the service</font>

1524
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:44,679
so meaning that in the first stage<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers</font>

1525
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:47,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovered select peers and in the</font>

1526
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:50,380
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage they directly queries them</font>

1527
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:54,000
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for service information this this</font>

1528
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:54,000
could also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other arm</font>

1529
01:13:54,329 --> 01:14:01,540
discovery protocols so enduring

1530
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:05,050
directory discovery the house discover a

1531
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:07,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">special service that is offered by a</font>

1532
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:11,079
private directory and we call the

1533
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:13,659
service dis the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PhDs service and this is</font>

1534
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:18,610
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a minimal dns server</font>

1535
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:21,519
running on on the host and when like in

1536
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:25,719
this example<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alice Anderson ever she</font>

1537
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:28,810
will first look for these pair<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers or</font>

1538
01:14:25,719 --> 01:14:33,639
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> select peers and then in the</font>

1539
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:35,800
second stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> cure them directly but to</font>

01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:39,969
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do privacy-preserving service</font>

1541
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:42,790
discovery the devices need to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1542
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:44,199
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify authorized devices that</font>

1543
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:46,929
are allowed to get the service

1544
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:49,480
information and to establish the

1545
01:14:46,929 --> 01:14:52,179
necessary relationship we<font color="#CCCCCC"> prefer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1546
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">device pairing this is the only step</font>

1547
01:14:52,179 --> 01:14:58,360
that will need user interaction so it

1548
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:01,509
has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be as convenient as possible we</font>

1549
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:03,730
propose two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pairing the first</font>

1550
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:06,460
one is an intra user pairing which we

1551
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:08,530
use to pair device of the same user and

1552
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:11,760
then they have an entry user pairing

1553
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:14,800
which we use to<font color="#E5E5E5"> parry devices of friends</font>

1554
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">so for the intro use of hearing you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1555
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,780
use methods that require a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1556
01:15:16,599 --> 01:15:22,270
none user interaction but for interview

1557
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:25,059
the pairing many different means we were

1558
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:30,190
on discussing<font color="#E5E5E5"> both push-button methods</font>

1559
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:32,170
or transmitting a secret and public

1560
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:35,829
authentication keys which can then be

1561
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:39,219
verified using QR codes this QR codes

1562
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:42,130
methods are already like used for

1563
01:15:39,219 --> 01:15:44,920
instant messaging applications like like

1564
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:46,929
pigeon but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still don't know how to</font>

1565
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:54,010
reduce this to practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1566
01:15:46,929 --> 01:15:55,320
discuss um Harry so for secure for

1567
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:58,829
private

1568
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:01,769
office of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PSD SS instances we need</font>

1569
01:15:58,829 --> 01:16:03,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">obfuscate at instance names and we</font>

1570
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:06,900
generate them by using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> secret</font>

1571
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:10,259
exchanged during pairing and hashing

1572
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:13,079
this concatenated with a seat and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1573
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:15,719
seed is a a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time stamp around in time</font>

1574
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:20,150
stamp that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to pre calculate</font>

1575
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:23,639
these values and we use pairwise

1576
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:25,799
identifiable obvious gated names and

1577
01:16:23,639 --> 01:16:28,230
packed<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten of those</font>

1578

names<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one service instance name to</font>

1579
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:34,909
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more efficient so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1580
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:37,769
summarize this two-stage approach the

1581
01:16:34,909 --> 01:16:39,839
first we have a private directory

1582
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:42,239
discovery which uses obvious gated host

1583
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,940
names it uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> an encoded instance names</font>

1584
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:48,780
and and only pair peers can identify

1585
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:55,369
these instances and for actual service

1586
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:58,290
discovery we used the PSD s service and

1587
01:16:55,369 --> 01:17:00,449
the actual service discovery is done by

1588
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:04,170
a unique house to this PSD a service on

1589
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:07,110
a encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel and we want to use</font>

1590
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:11,040
DNS over TLS using a diff<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahalan</font>

1591
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:13,320
preciate key mode of operation forces so

1592
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:16,110
then I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclude the short talk</font>

1593
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:20,519
with two questions first should we adopt

1594
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:23,098
this draft it proposed the two-stage

1595
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:26,310
approach for<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy preserving service</font>

1596
01:17:23,099 --> 01:17:29,880
discovery and the method is efficient as

1597
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:31,829
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduces multicast it reduces visual</font>

1598
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:34,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">collateral because all these PSD s</font>

1599
01:17:31,829 --> 01:17:36,239
instances belong to a dedicated service

1600
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:38,639
type and can easily be hidden in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a user</font>

1601
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:42,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">interface and it offers services only</font>

1602
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly to parent devices and the</font>

1603
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:48,090
second question is should we work on

1604
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:51,320
pairing pairing is essential for privacy

1605
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:53,880
preserving service discovery and other

1606
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications will also benefit from this</font>

1607
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:58,630
so thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the attention ok thank</font>

1608
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:01,929
you

1609
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:05,050
good concise presentation so Ted and

1610
01:18:01,929 --> 01:18:07,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stuart the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mic we've got time for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

1611
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:09,040
questions so far away<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so Ted</font>

1612
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:10,870
lemon first of all this is awesome i

1613
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,750
love this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really great I hadn't</font>

1614
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:15,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">even occurred to me to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this the</font>

1615
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:19,650
pairing problem is actually slightly

1616
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:21,968
larger than you've described because you

1617
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:25,179
the way that users discover each other

1618
01:18:21,969 --> 01:18:27,250
is that they get some message saying

1619
01:18:25,179 --> 01:18:28,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they get some indication the user</font>

1620
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:31,810
interface that there's someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> there to</font>

1621
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:33,400
discover without that mechanism they may

1622
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:35,230
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a chat</font>

1623
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,989
thing that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use to talk to each</font>

1624
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:39,750
other so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this I think</font>

1625
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:42,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you need to be able to say</font>

1626
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:44,440
something like somebody new showed up on

1627
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:48,010
the network you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look into</font>

1628
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:49,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">that somehow so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is really</font>

1629
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:52,780
neat i like this i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

1630
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:56,620
idea it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what we as of yet</font>

1631
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:58,540
thought of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that like when trying</font>

1632
01:18:56,620 --> 01:19:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use an instant messaging applications</font>

1633
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:02,949
users have let day they know each other

1634
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:04,960
beforehand and then they will meet and

1635
01:19:02,949 --> 01:19:06,730
do this pairing manually and then they

1636
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:10,030
can engage in serious discovery so it's

1637
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:12,250
like out of the protocol right at the

1638
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:14,980
moment the problem is requiring an end

1639
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:16,870
user to expect something that to work to

1640
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:18,428
expect something to be present requires

1641
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:20,800
them to have kind of a mental model that

1642
01:19:18,429 --> 01:19:22,540
they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have yeah and oftentimes</font>

1643
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,190
what happens one of the reasons why

1644
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,449
these why these services are so cool

1645
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:27,790
because people discover them

1646
01:19:25,449 --> 01:19:29,320
spontaneously so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1647
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:30,790
somehow preserve the spontaneous

1648
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,830
discovery while not violating people's

1649
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:35,739
privacy yes so that's what I'm getting

1650
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:39,909
yeah thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you very much and yeah please</font>

1651
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:43,750
check them out go go<font color="#E5E5E5"> eda the idea is</font>

1652
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:45,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> felling once and yes</font>

1653
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:49,870
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question of what tree girls</font>

1654
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:52,210
belly and clearly because me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i know</font>

1655
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:55,269
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm talk to you later I know you're</font>

1656
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:57,780
here I say we should bury<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then once</font>

1657
01:19:55,270 --> 01:20:00,630
you have paired you get in the room

1658
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:04,449
knock there are 50 people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room</font>

1659
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:06,699
but only five<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them are pairing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1660
01:20:04,449 --> 01:20:09,820
you so in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stage you will</font>

1661
01:20:06,699 --> 01:20:12,379
discover all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 people but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll do</font>

1662
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:14,360
a triage by<font color="#E5E5E5"> checking the value of you</font>

1663
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:17,180
since names you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only that one as</font>

1664
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:19,910
a magic token that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand so you</font>

1665
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:23,890
get at that point you get the address of

1666
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:27,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PI server your five friends and then</font>

1667
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:31,490
then for those ones you do not contact

1668
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:33,380
them using say DNS or Tara's can ask the

1669
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:36,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">vicar Oddie necessities question to find</font>

1670
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:38,960
out the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and the airport</font>

1671
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:46,220
number of the chat room that they want

1672
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:48,500
you but but I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is a</font>

1673
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:50,240
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea to automate this</font>

1674
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:53,210
pairing process because this is the only

1675
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:56,389
like ugly part of the protocol because

1676
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:58,430
it needs user<font color="#E5E5E5"> injection yeah I I think</font>

1677
01:20:56,390 --> 01:21:00,080
there's a way to do it I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

1678
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:05,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously have time</font>

1679
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:07,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes I am definitely saying that thing</font>

1680
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,260
yeah it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear that so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1681
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,910
one of the other concerns is the

1682
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:12,290
compatibility with everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else we're</font>

1683
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:14,120
doing here it sounds like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1684
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:15,710
that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just bolt on as a optional</font>

1685
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,480
extra if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a</font>

1686
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:19,250
good thing but we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be clear that</font>

1687
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,589
that's the case that the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1688
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:23,930
uses to use that benefits from it and it

1689
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:28,370
doesn't lose out in discovering other

1690
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:31,220
things potentially but well<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure this</font>

1691
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:33,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">is really interesting work thank you you</font>

1692
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:41,230
said you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a PhD when do you</font>

1693
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:41,230
finish maybe in january oh cool we smoke

1694
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:51,110
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do have one small question I saw</font>

1695
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:52,610
you use a time value to compute<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1696
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:55,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">obfuscated his name does that mean the</font>

1697
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:57,080
name changes at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font>

1698
01:21:55,220 --> 01:22:01,400
good so it sort of it's a voice being a

1699
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:02,900
tracking ID yes good thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you yes you</font>

1700
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:09,170
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it working group chairs get</font>

1701
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:12,200
finder fees so so Dave think they were

1702
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:14,180
on the two questions I think the my

1703
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,740
personal belief is the answer is yes but

1704
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:18,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the day but the definition of we should</font>

1705
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:21,800
be different in the top case the we

1706
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:23,480
refers to DNS SD working group and my

1707
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,909
belief is yes the Dean SSD working

1708
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,308
groups

1709
01:22:23,909 --> 01:22:28,379
the MSSD privacy absolutely and I think

1710
01:22:26,309 --> 01:22:30,119
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stress is good starting point on the</font>

1711
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:32,010
bottom one I think the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is yes for</font>

1712
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:34,348
a different definition of we I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

1713
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:36,179
notion of pairing<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns st is not the only</font>

1714
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:38,249
protocol with this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font>

1715
01:22:36,179 --> 01:22:39,269
benefit from pairing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1716
01:22:38,249 --> 01:22:40,860
bottom while the answer should be yes

1717
01:22:39,269 --> 01:22:44,459
but not within the scope of the dns st

1718
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:48,320
working mmm I i I'm peering back in an

1719
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:48,320
80s have any idea where that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

1720
01:22:48,709 --> 01:23:00,929
sag interior would be the two

1721
01:22:52,860 --> 01:23:03,058
possibilities confused ad um I'm

1722
01:23:00,929 --> 01:23:04,800
actually not sure I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to</font>

1723
01:23:03,059 --> 01:23:07,650
think about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1724
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:09,570
a very good point<font color="#CCCCCC"> age that to walk more</font>

1725
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:11,459
belongs way your solution appearing yes

1726
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:16,228
I want it to be not dismiss if occasion

1727
01:23:11,459 --> 01:23:18,749
SSD uh Ted lemon<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe dave has a</font>

1728
01:23:16,229 --> 01:23:20,159
good point there however if we were to

1729
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:25,519
do this in an Terry I just think it

1730
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:28,110
would buy nothing against<font color="#E5E5E5"> interior phone</font>

1731
01:23:25,519 --> 01:23:29,669
that's it does about what you're doing

1732
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:30,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">is you're taking it out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a room where</font>

1733
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:32,219
there are a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

1734
01:23:30,989 --> 01:23:33,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem and you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> putting in a room</font>

1735
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:37,590
where there's nobody interested in the

1736
01:23:33,449 --> 01:23:39,058
problem because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's you</font>

1737
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:41,280
know structurally somehow makes more

1738
01:23:39,059 --> 01:23:43,349
sense so we could say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we would work</font>

1739
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,999
on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not preclude it from working</font>

1740
01:23:43,349 --> 01:23:47,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">in other environments so do everything</font>

1741
01:23:44,999 --> 01:23:49,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">you possibly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can to avoid well I think</font>

1742
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:50,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a case to be made that it</font>

1743
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:53,639
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done here but if if that's</font>

1744
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:55,260
the correct answer then I think that

1745
01:23:53,639 --> 01:23:56,880
you're proposing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> for can do working</font>

1746
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:58,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I don't know the working group</font>

1747
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,419
in the ITF yeah that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font>

1748
01:23:58,829 --> 01:24:03,119
collection of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are interested</font>

1749
01:24:00,419 --> 01:24:05,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">so from my perspective as a matter of</font>

1750
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:08,188
expediency<font color="#CCCCCC"> and avoiding creating larger</font>

1751
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:10,739
schedules for I TFS in the future I

1752
01:24:08,189 --> 01:24:13,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it might make sense for the area</font>

1753
01:24:10,739 --> 01:24:16,589
directors involves to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves the</font>

1754
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:17,579
question would it be efficient to do it

1755
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:20,429
in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a</font>

1756
01:24:17,579 --> 01:24:24,900
community of interest here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so first</font>

1757
01:24:20,429 --> 01:24:28,679
question is who's read this draft it's a

1758
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:31,768
small number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands so it can be a</font>

1759
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:33,479
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote then but from what you've</font>

1760
01:24:31,769 --> 01:24:35,010
heard I mean you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a feel for what</font>

1761
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:37,680
its<font color="#E5E5E5"> are trying to do and</font>

1762
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:40,740
and how it may work who here would be in

1763
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:43,020
favor of the working group adopting this

1764
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:50,910
draft modulo where the pairing work is

1765
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:54,420
done in favor against so I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1766
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:58,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">just taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your glasses off there ok so</font>

1767
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:59,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've got moderates in favor but</font>

1768
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:00,870
from the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have read it though</font>

1769
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:03,780
the sounds they look like all those

1770
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:06,960
hands went up which is good tom yeah I

1771
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:09,300
read the draft and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1772
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:13,950
obfuscation in there now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is</font>

1773
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:18,930
your algorithm I think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good</font>

1774
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:21,690
to have the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined better and</font>

1775
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:26,550
we adopt that draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

1776
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:28,230
solutions may be separately yeah I think

1777
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:30,840
that's an interesting point but I mean

1778
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:32,669
this draft started off stating a problem

1779
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:35,700
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of in version 01</font>

1780
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:37,890
expression 00 version 01 it's started

1781
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:40,139
taking the steps into solution space so

1782
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:42,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ID there</font>

1783
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:44,760
as to whether he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer that we</font>

1784
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:47,340
adopted the bit that stated the problem

1785
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:50,160
and published that and then continue the

1786
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:53,450
work towards a solution many comments

1787
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:55,860
there or do we do it all in one document

1788
01:25:53,450 --> 01:26:00,420
I'm actually quite fine to do it all in

1789
01:25:55,860 --> 01:26:02,549
one document<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i think the coming</font>

1790
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:04,110
there is then to make sure that the

1791
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:07,500
requirements and the problem are stated

1792
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:10,920
clearly in the draft as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1793
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:14,670
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay ralphs checking</font>

1794
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:16,320
for blue sheets<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we will take</font>

1795
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for confirmation to the list as to</font>

1796
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,590
what people want to do with adopting the

1797
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:23,669
draft thank you very much again so we've

1798
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:25,560
got about five minutes left the last

1799
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:29,790
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were going to discuss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was other</font>

1800
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:33,990
drafts and next steps so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1801
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:39,990
can cut across to my laptop fast enough

1802
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:41,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">or can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I ok there's basically as I</font>

1803
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:43,489
wrecked the place there's basically

1804
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:45,289
three

1805
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:52,940
draft here that we've got outstanding

1806
01:26:45,289 --> 01:26:55,039
from other places oh it's came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

1807
01:26:52,940 --> 01:27:00,039
hopefully it'll come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> again there we</font>

1808
01:26:55,039 --> 01:27:02,929
go so there's all the drafts that we've

1809
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:04,670
covered there are these three the left I

1810
01:27:02,929 --> 01:27:07,550
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about some hybrid</font>

1811
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:09,590
proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero comp from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ray and that will</font>

1812
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:11,059
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take that fire rainn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disgusted</font>

1813
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:14,780
Marcus about where we stand with that

1814
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:18,019
we've got two other<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts the general</font>

1815
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:20,389
DNS SD threats documents is parked is

1816
01:27:18,019 --> 01:27:22,909
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask adopting it there</font>

1817
01:27:20,389 --> 01:27:24,829
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> outstanding questions from a couple</font>

1818
01:27:22,909 --> 01:27:26,869
of people against that draft on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list</font>

1819
01:27:24,829 --> 01:27:28,849
of not being answered so once the

1820
01:27:26,869 --> 01:27:30,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">authors answer those questions</font>

1821
01:27:28,849 --> 01:27:32,690
satisfactorily we may be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1822
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:35,329
progress that so do check the list for

1823
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:37,518
that thread and comment on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you can</font>

1824
01:27:35,329 --> 01:27:39,349
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last one which I kind of</font>

1825
01:27:37,519 --> 01:27:41,420
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits in somewhat with what we</font>

1826
01:27:39,349 --> 01:27:45,380
were discussing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how you use things</font>

1827
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:47,269
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> practice maybe five meetings ago we</font>

1828
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:49,070
had a draft presented on how you might

1829
01:27:47,269 --> 01:27:51,619
optimize the queries and where it's most

1830
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:54,049
effective to do query filtering whether

1831
01:27:51,619 --> 01:27:55,429
it's on the client the server or the

1832
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:57,590
responses you<font color="#E5E5E5"> received back to the</font>

1833
01:27:55,429 --> 01:28:00,019
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it might be worth revisiting</font>

1834
01:27:57,590 --> 01:28:01,639
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll contact the author see if</font>

1835
01:28:00,019 --> 01:28:04,670
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still interested or he or she I</font>

1836
01:28:01,639 --> 01:28:06,530
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember in revisiting that I</font>

1837
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:09,440
think it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth doing that at</font>

1838
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:13,969
the next ITF meeting and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> just then</font>

1839
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:16,940
leaves us with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the final steps of next</font>

1840
01:28:13,969 --> 01:28:20,019
steps is there any work here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1841
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:22,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we should be doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're not</font>

1842
01:28:20,019 --> 01:28:24,170
any other brilliant ideas for what we

1843
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:25,400
should be doing I think it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1844
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:27,440
the last couple of meetings you've taken

1845
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:29,388
the privacy aspect on board that's

1846
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:33,589
really good so anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that we're</font>

1847
01:28:29,389 --> 01:28:37,309
missing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1848
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:39,349
that's kind of encouraging I think there

1849
01:28:37,309 --> 01:28:40,820
is the potential to look at reach our

1850
01:28:39,349 --> 01:28:42,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">turing as we discussed at the start but</font>

1851
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:45,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think there are some clear actions at</font>

1852
01:28:42,889 --> 01:28:46,940
the moment on the hybrid proxy and on

1853
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:49,730
the dns pushed but i think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

1854
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:51,739
finish those little pieces first before

1855
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:53,509
we consider recharging so a recharging

1856
01:28:51,739 --> 01:28:56,928
discussion might happen at the next ITF

1857
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:59,510
meeting i would i would guess

1858
01:28:56,929 --> 01:29:01,670
yeah so we'll have a list discussion

1859
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:03,769
before the meeting a thumb up from the

1860
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:07,869
ad so the actions I've got down here

1861
01:29:03,769 --> 01:29:12,380
from the meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the key ones anyway</font>

1862
01:29:07,869 --> 01:29:15,739
first one is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the well we'll get the</font>

1863
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:18,590
harpy proxy update done we'll get the

1864
01:29:15,739 --> 01:29:20,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS push and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> signalling updates done so</font>

1865
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:21,280
the signaling work or be done first<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1866
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:25,070
that's going to happen really quickly

1867
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:28,130
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's sorted you can then go and</font>

1868
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:29,268
update the dns push document stripping

1869
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:31,219
out the bits that have moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1870
01:29:29,269 --> 01:29:33,019
signaling document Stewart said

1871
01:29:31,219 --> 01:29:35,780
semantically it's the same recent

1872
01:29:33,019 --> 01:29:41,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes in the syntax third thing which</font>

1873
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:43,789
be the design team formal informal to

1874
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:45,949
look at the usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk all flat home net</font>

1875
01:29:43,789 --> 01:29:48,860
problem for the time being I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1876
01:29:45,949 --> 01:29:51,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">all know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we mean related to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1877
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:54,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">also dns updates and hybrid proxy</font>

1878
01:29:51,729 --> 01:29:57,769
coexisting in an enterprise or canvas

1879
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:59,719
environment so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think Ted is currently</font>

1880
01:29:57,769 --> 01:30:01,729
has taken that all on himself we need to

1881
01:29:59,719 --> 01:30:03,050
get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> help whether people like range</font>

1882
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:04,999
do it and others may be willing that

1883
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:06,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be great so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if Ted can</font>

1884
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:09,260
kick off the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list</font>

1885
01:30:06,739 --> 01:30:12,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">again and call for help that would be</font>

1886
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:14,630
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> welcome next thing was thick the</font>

1887
01:30:12,829 --> 01:30:15,978
guidance draft I think we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a good</font>

1888
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:18,679
discussion there and got some ideas

1889
01:30:15,979 --> 01:30:20,780
thanks to ralphs presentation I would

1890
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:25,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">point you also to Tom mentioned it he's</font>

1891
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:27,499
got some configuration examples in a

1892
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:29,509
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could post there's a link</font>

1893
01:30:27,499 --> 01:30:34,369
to that in the chairs slide so if you

1894
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:35,630
look back in fact here we go so if you

1895
01:30:34,369 --> 01:30:37,188
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chairs slides as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> link</font>

1896
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:39,409
there to the github repository where

1897
01:30:37,189 --> 01:30:43,010
he's draft currently sits it's just not

1898
01:30:39,409 --> 01:30:46,489
published yet so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it expired say</font>

1899
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:48,559
have a have a look at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> or Tom can</font>

1900
01:30:46,489 --> 01:30:50,419
repost it somehow so we can all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1901
01:30:48,559 --> 01:30:52,130
look so that's more than configuration

1902
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:53,719
side rather than the high level how you

1903
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:56,119
stitch things<font color="#E5E5E5"> together which is the sort</font>

1904
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:58,189
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that ralph was talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1905
01:30:56,119 --> 01:31:00,679
we need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guidance draft kicked</font>

1906
01:30:58,189 --> 01:31:03,050
off somehow so Ralph and Tom and maybe

1907
01:31:00,679 --> 01:31:05,420
others will do that and then the final

1908
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:07,429
thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had was the privacy draft we'll</font>

1909
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:09,650
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the list to confirm adoption</font>

1910
01:31:07,429 --> 01:31:10,900
of that document and will speak to the

1911
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">80s about</font>

1912
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:15,700
the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best plan in terms of where</font>

1913
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:18,220
you might define that the pairing aspect

1914
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:20,470
of that since um we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to have some</font>

1915
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:21,970
critical mass to work on it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ted is</font>

1916
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:23,860
basically said<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we take it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of here</font>

1917
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:26,440
we may not have any critical mass so

1918
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:29,679
keeping it here maybe the best thing but

1919
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:32,259
we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i think that's it any</font>

1920
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:37,150
any final things anyone wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say if</font>

1921
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:38,620
not we're going to release you okay yep
