00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,559
we'll have seen this slide before it's

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:12,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the note well and please pay attention</font>

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,360
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you understand what you</font>

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:21,140
are actually participating with when you

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:22,490
agree to follow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF processes we're</font>

00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">just starting to hand out the blue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sheet</font>

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,820
so please make sure that you sign the

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,979
blue sheet before you leave the room

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're check a few times during the</font>

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,610
meeting to make sure that everyone

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,130
touches signing the blue sheets and

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,530
perhaps where they are we had a

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,390
volunteer already on the list for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,719
minute taker today I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're like</font>

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,879
see are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you still able to use</font>

got and Neville taking notes as well and

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,239
I'll take some notes so we should have

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that covered but it would be nice if we</font>

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,760
had a jabber scribe so up Adrian sat in

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:06,289
the seats<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the hot seat so great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thank</font>

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">You Adrian so we have a one-hour session</font>

25
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,970
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the agenda we're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

26
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,730
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our current working group documents</font>

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,800
so let's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of use this as a quick</font>

28
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,680
status update now so congratulations we

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,730
now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work in group documents</font>

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,700
commiserations we now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to working</font>

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:26,270
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments so this is our generic</font>

32
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,550
policy information model document this

33
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,110
was kind of an optional document it was

34
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,560
something that was discussed in charger

35
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,210
in the milestones but it seemed that the

36
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous ITF it was a document that</font>

37
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,520
people were willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read and work on</font>

38
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:42,710
so we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adopt this particular</font>

39
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,640
piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work as our first item we</font>

40
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:50,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently closed the pole and adopted the</font>

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,610
data model dot document so we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

42
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,930
some sort of tangible concrete pieces of

43
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,580
work that we really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

44
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,500
polish and work on and we will talk

45
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,660
about these documents and the challenges

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,690
and and what would like to see with

47
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:06,039
these documents during today's session

48
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:10,128
we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a discussion from will</font>

49
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:16,250
highlighting the framework proposal we

50
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:18,290
had two documents presented welp sent to

51
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,969
the list discussed

52
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,640
a brief discussion last week by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Burt</font>

53
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:26,780
thank you sorry last<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDF Thank You Bert</font>

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:30,290
and we now seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one proposal</font>

55
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,329
this is so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

56
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,739
document and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

57
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:38,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">statement that's going to be presented</font>

58
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:42,379
by June actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> georgius is going</font>

59
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,810
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> presenting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the the agenda on</font>

60
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,530
the website is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> accurate these</font>

61
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,840
slides are not accurate so<font color="#E5E5E5"> update that</font>

62
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,790
and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> rakesh do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rakesh in the room I saw you yet earlier</font>

64
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,659
great so Rakesh is going to present some

65
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,280
work and there's maybe some

66
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:01,608
applicability or overlap or cross

67
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,849
fertilization between I to NSF and super

68
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:06,349
so this is everyone happy with the

69
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:10,819
current agenda are there any changes or

70
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:14,078
requests<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great can we have our</font>

71
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">first presenter please</font>

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,129
chattering there any losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> box in here</font>

73
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:49,040
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh have you got the big</font>

74
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:52,879
casino sir Oh give me so hi my name is

75
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,700
John<font color="#CCCCCC"> stroessner and this is an</font>

76
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:59,959
unreadable screen but now it is thank

77
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:04,238
you this is the supe generic policy

78
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,799
information model and a it works yay

79
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,680
this first slide there were still some

80
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,950
questions about G do we really need an

81
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">information model or not um and so this</font>

82
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:19,699
slide is saying it'd really be nice

83
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:22,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">because otherwise you have two problems</font>

84
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:26,210
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them interoperability first</font>

85
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,039
problem is that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

86
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,370
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of policies from</font>

87
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:35,270
different actors the second is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

88
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:38,240
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that you'll have different</font>

89
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:43,580
types of grammars terminology and

90
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:46,550
concepts used a resulting<font color="#CCCCCC"> con problem is</font>

91
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,159
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have an information model</font>

92
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:54,530
to normalize concepts if we want to

93
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:57,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach out to chef or puppet or ansible</font>

94
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:02,840
or AWS etc it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be rather</font>

95
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:06,410
difficult to do in the interest of time

96
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll skip this the most important thing</font>

97
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:12,280
as the bottom standardized policies help

98
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:18,560
heterogeneous systems to interoperate a

99
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:22,969
main changes from dash 0 6 which was the

100
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:27,110
individual draft we renamed and

101
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:31,220
redesigned one of the classes called

102
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">supe vendor decorated component it's not</font>

103
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:37,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it wasn't really we decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that making</font>

104
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:39,860
it vendor specific was

105
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,410
really too hard for right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

106
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,030
interest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we wanted to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

107
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,060
more generic which made more sense

108
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,010
anyway so we made those changes we

109
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:53,450
responded to questions in the mailing

110
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:57,980

to be the introduction was rewritten<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

118
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:32,510
clarified we did one final major

redesign of the metadata class other

than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model is stable we're</font>

121
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:43,130
experimenting with adding a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

122
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:46,420
small classes to take care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

123
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,890
problems that one has with null in

124
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:53,090
implementations that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be in debt the</font>

125
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:56,630
next version but other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that the</font>

126
00:06:53,090 --> 00:07:05,080
content is stable this is the GPM

127
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:09,020
taxonomy so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is yay so here at the</font>

128
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:13,190
top of the tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you have policy</font>

129
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:16,609
policy structure is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> superclass for</font>

building policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> rules and then policy</font>

component structure is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the superclass</font>

132
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:28,310
for building components that can be put

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:33,620
inside a policy rule um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other major</font>

134
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:36,830
classes here under policy components you

135
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:40,130
have a policy clause which is the basic

136
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:44,479
building block for building statements

137
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:50,080
that are policies you have a decorator

138
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:53,620
which enables us to add zero or more

139
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:57,188
checks or portions of objects to a

140
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,509
policy clause and that that is an

141
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:03,280
implementation optimization because

142
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,650
instead of requiring all of the

143
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,590
attributes for a class to be added at

144
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:11,049
runtime I can pick off an attribute here

145
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:15,219
a method there it's a well established

146
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:18,210
pattern used in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java and Python and</font>

147
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:22,900
other languages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've imported it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

148
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:25,900
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy clauses this subclass gives</font>

149
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,849
you a canonical form of a policy but you

150
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,539
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact if you just</font>

151
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:36,880
want to ship yang or CLI just simply use

152
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:40,380
this encoded cause you you shove the CLI

153
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,049
or gang or tl1 or whatever you want um

154
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:47,890
into an attribute and life is good and

155
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:54,510
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> finally a policy collection enables</font>

156
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:58,899
us to do event correlation and event

157
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">aggregation and return that back to the</font>

00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:04,959
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> logic to generate new policy</font>

159
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:08,829
rules at runtime um and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

160
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:13,239
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is the metadata hierarchy with</font>

161
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:16,870
two real examples of metadata if we look

162
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,670
at the ECA policy model the most

163
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:24,490
important point is that no class is

164
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:27,099
derived from I mean well let me put it

165
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,970
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the positive way all classes are</font>

166
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:35,440
derived from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a GPM class so it is a</font>

167
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:41,079
strict a sub hierarchy of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> genome</font>

168
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:43,750
model um so we've added an ECA policy

169
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:46,300
rule to represent imperative clauses and

170
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,300
we've used the composite software

171
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:53,589
pattern to represent either individual

172
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:57,029
rules or a hierarchy of rules we've used

173
00:09:53,589 --> 00:10:00,730
we have a subclass of policy clause 2-b

174
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:03,430
boolean policy clauses and again the

175
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:08,080
same composite pattern to do

176
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:11,709
jewel or hierarchies of boolean clauses

177
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:19,570
and then event condition and action of

178
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:22,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">are built here next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steps um there's one</font>

179
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:26,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">last software pattern that we want to</font>

180
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:30,040
put in as a completely optional set of

181
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:33,490
classes to protect from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nastiness of</font>

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowles and give a more generic error</font>

handling capability for the data model

184
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:44,020
and the main work of four dash 0 2 is

185
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be adding lots and lots and</font>

186
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:54,459
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of examples and as always feedback</font>

187
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:58,149
is welcome that's it questions I guess

188
00:10:54,459 --> 00:11:00,880
I'm hmm I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been faster David</font>

189
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,770
Olson I yes examples please I was

190
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,020
finding it really hard to understand so

191
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:07,120
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at least the way I look at this</font>

192
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,850
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing examples would be critical</font>

193
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:15,240
yeah thank you examples are coming your

194
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:20,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">way by the way before the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sole made him</font>

195
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:28,529
yes you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote me mr. chair anything</font>

196
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:28,529
else get a ray Joel<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you John</font>

197
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:47,239
okay thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> John I will now briefly</font>

198
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:53,929
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data model because there</font>

199
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:56,509
isn't a lot to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say we took the 00 of the</font>

200
00:11:53,929 --> 00:12:02,029
adoptive data model draft is just

201
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:05,089
exactly the same as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last draft that</font>

202
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:06,619
was it was under my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name so there are no</font>

203
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:09,199
changes there so there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

204
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:13,249
to discuss in that regard we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

205
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:15,228
on building a 01 so we say we have we

206
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:17,659
haven't actually managed to get the 01

207
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:21,289
up there we were hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we didn't</font>

208
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:23,629
quite make it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had it where we're</font>

209
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:25,639
in the process of adding explanatory

210
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:28,699
text on how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang was constructed</font>

211
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,789
there are some pieces in the yang itself

212
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:33,348
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suggest what we did but we</font>

213
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:35,569
need to actually put in all of the

214
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:37,759
explanation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says we took the</font>

215
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:39,738
information model and here's what we did

216
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,559
to construct the data model to make it

217
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:44,989
easier for you to read the ayah the data

218
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,118
model or to understand the relationship

219
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:51,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the two whichever way you want</font>

220
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:53,089
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process of</font>

221
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:56,029
construction is a human algorithmic

222
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:57,529
transform it is probably the case you

223
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:59,869
could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-five percent of the way</font>

224
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:04,009
there with a machine transform if you

225
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:06,619
could process the X<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UML but we just</font>

226
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:09,949
did it by<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand and we will do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

227
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:11,569
updates to bring the dash<font color="#CCCCCC"> L 1 into</font>

228
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:13,909
alignment with the changes Jon just

229
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:16,069
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about by hand because we don't</font>

230
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:19,339
expect to have lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complicated</font>

231
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:22,429
issues there so these two slides just

232
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:23,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">got reversed this should have been the</font>

233
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:26,869
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide I don't know how that</font>

234
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:29,869
happened my apologies the point is you

235
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:32,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the 00 it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it only appeared</font>

236
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:36,829
yesterday because we submitted it last

237
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:39,079
week with the ad approval only<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:42,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">secretary it was too busy to actually do</font>

239
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:45,228
the ad approved submission during the

240
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:48,169
block and we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize it haven't</font>

241
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:50,460
gone through when we finally realized it

242
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:55,530
we resubmitted sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

243
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:57,420
folks and so and we also because young

244
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,699
documents need a yang tree we're adding

245
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,079
a yang tree I gotta say it's not going

246
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,610
to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> much because the tree is</font>

247
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,280
going to say container container

248
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,050
container container container but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

249
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,939
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there so that you have the</font>

250
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">information to show you what's going on</font>

251
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we're most models rely on the</font>

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,920
containment structures in yang this

253
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:19,050
relies very heavily on<font color="#E5E5E5"> inheritance</font>

254
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,459
structures which are have to be

255
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:25,560
represented a different way as I

256
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:28,050
discussed last meeting so all modeling

257
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,780
changes will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done to both the IM MDM</font>

258
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,699
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the modeling use</font>

259
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,430
whichever document you're more

260
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,010
comfortable looking at tell us what

261
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,109
modeling issues you find we will make

262
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure it gets applied in both cases you</font>

263
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,120
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to worry about do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font>

264
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:48,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you the comments twice no just tell</font>

265
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">us what your what issues you find the</font>

266
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,960
working group discusses what the working

267
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,350
group tells us to do to the model we do

268
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,600
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

269
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:00,540
gang problems if you find specifically

270
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,060
that this yang doesn't work or it's the

271
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:07,560
wrong way to do it say so we'll fix the

272
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">annular the data model um and if you if</font>

273
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,920
the working group says I you shouldn't

274
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">be using enumerations you should be</font>

275
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,199
using integers for something fine we'll

276
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:20,130
do that and as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll add</font>

277
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,350
explanatory text we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on trying</font>

278
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:25,020
to find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right balance between the</font>

279
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,520
detail we've got in the IM and we've got

280
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,520
a lot of detail there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't want to</font>

281
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,069
repeat all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that detail in the yang</font>

282
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,890
model but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put enough</font>

283
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,990
information enough description into the

284
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,310
DM that a reader can have a reasonable

285
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,700
understanding of what they're doing

286
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,920
there it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> say for further details see</font>

287
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,020
the IM but there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a reasonable</font>

288
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,390
level we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't say you must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font>

289
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,860
the IM just to understand the basics of

290
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,750
the model because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

291
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:56,870
both documents and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

292
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ball up to date questions</font>

293
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,490
binoculars maybe one question regarding

294
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,890
the exam or even mentioning should all

295
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the examples be in the information model</font>

296
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,689
or the data model we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put all</font>

297
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,910
the examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the IM and some of them</font>

298
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,540
in the DM so that people see how the

299
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:21,760
yang derives the set from that from them

300
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,079
or not but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show we want to</font>

301
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure the IM is understandable</font>

302
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:34,720
wouldn't put examples there some of

303
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:40,120
those will go in the DM as well John

304
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stroessner um do we are toying with the</font>

305
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,480
idea of actually going from what we're

306
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:49,540
to software um and I don't know if we

307
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,300
could make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> by soul but as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Joel said</font>

308
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,760
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the yang you're going</font>

309
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,990
to be struck with<font color="#CCCCCC"> G there's a pattern</font>

310
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,520
here where there's actually three

311
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:02,890
patterns in the yang so therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

312
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,990
should be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build software if we</font>

313
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:08,889
do build software and it actually works

314
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,839
then we'll either put it in well we

315
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,750
would obviously put in github but we

316
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,429
probably put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one of the hackathons</font>

317
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,640
you know with yang so that other people

318
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,860
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it and say gee how good is</font>

319
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,930
this can we take other information

320
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:25,899
models and use that to generate

321
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:29,850
reasonable yang so keep your fingers

322
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,850
crossed and we'll see what happens

323
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,270
bethania so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to implement the</font>

324
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:40,540
datum all I my understanding Ross we

325
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:44,620
have the information model so that if

326
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:47,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">people want to model it the data using</font>

327
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,120
yang maybe SMI maybe go by or maybe

328
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,970
something else I have no something in

329
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,879
the future I don't know that's why we

330
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:57,880
have the information model and I thought

331
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,400
that I would hope that if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a data</font>

332
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,430
model that comes out of that based on

333
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information model I understand that</font>

334
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:08,770
that it would be a standalone document

335
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,170
that if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement I would hope</font>

336
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,590
I can do with reading just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a day</font>

337
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,179
tomorrow

338
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,639
and not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

339
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:18,490

340
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,620
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> very uncomfortable we can we could</font>

341
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:25,000
literally copy all of the description of

342
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:29,129
texts from the IM to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DM but I a I</font>

343

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't like saying things twice and be</font>

344
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,220
people already complain about the

345
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:35,260
lengths of these documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and I</font>

346
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,360
understand you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want but we will</font>

347
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,850
put in enough information that the DM

348
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,399
will be understandable and should be

349
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:45,039
implementable you shouldn't need to

350
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">unplug the objects but tip them at the</font>

351
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,490
whole system there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

352
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,230
be information in the IM from my

353
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,789
perspective it's much easier to work

354
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,159
with the IM in terms of understanding

355
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:56,890
information structure for other people

356
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,330
the DM is easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with so you can</font>

357
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,100
give you can do either one for

358
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,990
understanding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

relationships are not represented in

yang and so I can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about</font>

that the emphatic me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am okay and it's</font>

367

expressing information models for some

of the standard mid modules who went

kind of used<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of two types of</font>

they're any of those are possible one of

375
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:12,270
them was actually including relationship

with the information model<font color="#E5E5E5"> Claude</font>

377
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:19,600
section which actually was basically

378
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:23,770
tables of mapping of objects including

379
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,149
their inclusion so you were mentioning

380
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,219
relationship

381
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:29,918
the other one was using reference

382
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:32,710
clauses which have an equivalent in in

383
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,219
young so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly do not need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

384
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,739
copy description<font color="#E5E5E5"> text absolutely not but</font>

385
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:40,659
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only the data model will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

386
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:43,179
complete the only question is how much

387
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:46,210
how do you we get enough descriptive

388
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:48,159
text to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful without copying for</font>

389
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,489
both things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have all of the details</font>

390
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,139
and that's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at that part</font>

391
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:55,239
isn't there yet but do take a look at

392
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:57,339
the data modeling and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

393
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:59,859
modeling and say is this readable data

394
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,229
modeling thing there are deep all the

395
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:04,599
details are currently in the IM as I've

396
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:06,999
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put significantly</font>

397
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:09,249
more detail into the yang draft I'm not

398
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:12,039
saying we're going to leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

399
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:14,409
details in the IM because it does need

400
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make sense to be coherent as a data</font>

401
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:19,149
model document it's just a question of

402
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:21,879
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much detail we put in how much</font>

403
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:24,070
explanation so as I say expect mostly

404
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:25,779
examples to be in the IM but there will

405
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">be enough examples that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how the</font>

406
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:31,059
yang works and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not left going</font>

407
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:32,649
what is that yang nothing really mean we

408
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,749
gotta have enough examples in the data

409
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:37,268
model so that you do know and you can

410
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:41,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure you've implemented right the</font>

411
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:45,309
goal Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Joel just before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

412
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:47,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to control so we've</font>

413
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:51,309
got now the working with document which

414
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:55,029
is the exact copy of your previous draft

415
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:59,979
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> last updated in April right</font>

416
00:21:55,029 --> 00:22:02,019
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous ITF very soon we're</font>

417
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:05,379
going to be very shortly producing a 01

418
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:07,929
that updates to two things things like

419
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:09,549
the absence we hanging tree and things

420
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:11,859
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then that will be</font>

421
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:15,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">available for the word discuss it we ran</font>

422
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:18,309
out of time this is fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

423
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:20,678
also make a statement that we we have

424
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:22,330
some sort of deadline to make it easy

425
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,629
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group like you know the</font>

426
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,968
deadline for<font color="#E5E5E5"> submission and for two</font>

427
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:31,418
drafts right did this one you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font>

428
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:32,889
for sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the updated like this week and</font>

429
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:36,999
you also still the one from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> prius</font>

document before we started making

436
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:52,000

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,840
will talk about a little bit about the

455
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:58,539
background so first you can see the

456
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,240
position is that really the behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

457
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:03,610
schedule actually arm so this should be

submitted the earlier and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> history</font>

459
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:09,219
about this draft came to quite a long

460
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:12,220
time so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a lot about the</font>

470
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:47,139
brief section about the framework very

471
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:51,929
simple one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then in this year earlier</font>

on april we have a on because on the

change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility so I lead</font>

475
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:06,299
this new draft which is on on we

476
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,789
formally replaced the very beginning the

477
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:10,740
first one they drafted Joe and we

478
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:13,408
modified according to the latest

479
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,659
discussion and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> add the details to</font>

480
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:19,769
describe what's the framework look like

481
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:23,490
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> standalone framework</font>

482
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:27,929
draft and we updated the earlier this

483
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:30,389
month 201 we thanks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the reviewers</font>

484
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:35,159
and we have addressed the most of the

485
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:37,498
comments and we added<font color="#E5E5E5"> a figure about the</font>

486
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:42,330
relationship among the service policy

487
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:46,200
and resources um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

488
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:50,369
just updated in 202 but it's not

489
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,200
submitted right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now I distributed to</font>

490
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:54,209
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the reviewers to let them know</font>

491
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,369
whether they're happy with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the changes</font>

492
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:02,460
we because we address the most of the

493
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:05,639
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the comments um so here we i'm</font>

494
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,429
gonna use three figures to describe the

495
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:10,799
on a framework here so the first one is

496
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:14,999
how su país used so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like the</font>

497
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:18,059
procedure um as strong and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe</font>

498
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:19,409
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> on present the information model</font>

499
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:21,690
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data model I won't go to the</font>

500
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:25,320
details but first we need to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

501
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:28,499
well on if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at at the top and we</font>

502
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,360
have hf to design<font color="#E5E5E5"> this saw information</font>

503
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:32,730
model and the data models and these

504
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,189
information models<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have the guided I</font>

505
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:38,460
mean can<font color="#E5E5E5"> guide the design of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font>

506
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:42,119
models which can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean used together</font>

507
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:45,629
with those resource and service young

508
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:50,309
models together to these service

509
00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:53,279
interface logic and this one I mean can

510
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:56,070
create appropriate mechanism for the

511
00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:00,119
operators to I mean to<font color="#E5E5E5"> define their own</font>

512
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:02,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">policies accordingly and to create and</font>

513
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> onion creating or managing the</font>

514
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:07,770
network underlying

515
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:10,260
and the I mean the operator can<font color="#CCCCCC"> interact</font>

516
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:13,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this such an interface and which is</font>

517
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:18,120
then translated into the configurations

518
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:22,320
and snip snip it so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the procedure</font>

519
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:25,979
and then we have a traditionally way to

520
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,620
describe the I mean the framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

521
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,810
looks like how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I mean inter crack</font>

522
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,530
interconnected I mean interact with

523
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:37,350
other blocks so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the UM gpim</font>

524
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:40,260
on the top and if you by the way d here

525
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:43,709
means are derived<font color="#E5E5E5"> from so which means</font>

526
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:46,620
that we are we the generic policy data

527
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:49,980
model can be derived from the GPR em as

528
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,020
well as I mean the ECE policy view

529
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,950
information model also can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be derived by</font>

530
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:59,970
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> G time then um we're using this</font>

531
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:03,180
tool to I mean guide<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee on the design</font>

532
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:07,010
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easy policy route data model</font>

533
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:10,230
which can be finally used I mean I mean

534
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicated to the network network</font>

535
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:16,620
management or the controller in other

536
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:19,800
way and there we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resource or</font>

537
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:22,290
the service models and just like I said

538
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:25,470
in last I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean in previous slides then</font>

539
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:27,930
this can be I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we can have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the on</font>

540
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:34,560
configurations eventually to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

541
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:37,530
element to the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and line um this</font>

542
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:41,310
figure actually was added because on

543
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:43,290
things we I mean proposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> supa in I</font>

544
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:47,070
mean a long time people<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep asking</font>

545
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:50,330
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relationship between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surveys</font>

546
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:54,000
and the policy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually um we have a</font>

547
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:57,750
wiki which is a generated I mean we

548
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,910
maintained by me and there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> q</font>

549
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:05,520
and A's I guess maybe this one can be

550
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:09,180
also added into the wiki so um I just

551
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">added this figure and some materials</font>

552
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,880
into our noon I mean draft to describe

553
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,679
the relationship I mean yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> review</font>

554
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,860
what's the relationship between policy

555
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,500
and surveys

556
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,479
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy and resource of course</font>

557
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:26,110
the service and resource readership is

558
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,910
out of our scope but I just draw this

559
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:31,419
line to make everybody have a big

560
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:35,320
picture so here on thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drones help</font>

561
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:38,200
make the I mean language<font color="#E5E5E5"> more clear and</font>

562
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,809
like a poem<font color="#E5E5E5"> very beautiful so here we</font>

563
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the policy manages and the Canada</font>

564
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:46,059
justice service behavior as necessary a

565
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:48,909
please note that here we have a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

566
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:52,270
relationship that this policy and

567
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:56,410
service can have a one-to-one or 12

568
00:29:52,270 --> 00:30:00,040
multiple on relationship means that you

569
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:02,350
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> using one single policy to</font>

570
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:07,080
manipulate I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage configure I</font>

571
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:10,600
mean one or given multiple services and

572
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:13,540
similarly we have policy manages and can

573
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,760
adjust the service behavior I'm sorry

574
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,610
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> must be something wrong here and</font>

575
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,160
just the resource behavior as necessary

576
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:24,549
so there is a mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I'm sorry so</font>

577
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:28,000
the similarly<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a 12 multi or</font>

578
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:31,120
one-to-one relationship between policy

579
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and resource so the last sentence um is</font>

580
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,760
about service and resource so I not

581
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:40,570
gonna read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's out scope and</font>

582
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next slide shows you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comments</font>

583
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:47,080
and next step so thanks for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

584
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:49,780
reviewers are we have received many

585
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,070
comments on the mailing list or I mean

586
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:57,000
offline or face-to-face discussions I

587
00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:01,299
briefly I mean categories based on

588
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,809
comments into this 51 I mean this fight

589
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:06,940
so the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that what's the</font>

590
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:09,490
relationship between I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

591
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,770
what I explained so we add a figure and

592
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,440
we are the paragraphs to explain the

593
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:18,490
relationship between<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy and service</font>

594
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:22,750
and then um it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the explanation</font>

595
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:26,860
on the process of the GP IM and the

596
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:30,250
chipra epr I'm and we add a section

597
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:34,719
they're not section at a paragraph there

598
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:36,850
to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue and of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

599
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to update the some references</font>

600
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:45,790
because um we have a new draft and and

601
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:49,660
we even have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are I mean RFC 6020</font>

602
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:51,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece and also some of the failures we</font>

603
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,140
need to polish actually already done

604
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:56,560
this and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see from these slides</font>

605
00:31:53,140 --> 00:32:00,030
the figures are already polished and you

606
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:03,580
can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see those in our new draft and</font>

607
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:06,850
the last one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only comments that I</font>

608
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:09,040
haven't decided how to do it and I want

609
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask the audience here is that whether</font>

610
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,080
we should on me talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I mean</font>

611
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:17,280
how the declaratory policy to fit in

612
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,629
because this is now out of scope and

613
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:23,070
actually I receive these comments from

614
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:25,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Burt and also from crush from juniper</font>

615
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,610
yesterday we have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long discussion</font>

616
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,550
about this topic I guess little<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

617
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:33,399
explain so I'm also I really wants to

618
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:35,050
listen to cheers the ad and all the

619
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,450
audience so whether we should for

620
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,490
example we should just to keep silent on

621
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,730
this topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> or we should write a small</font>

622
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:46,750
sentence or paragraph about this is not

623
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:50,020
in our scope but if there is something

624
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:53,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be discussed how do we do this so we</font>

625
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:56,129
are open to your opinions and the next

626
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:59,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">step will be oh I already updated the</font>

627
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:02,290
draft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can submit it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean after</font>

628
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:05,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the rivers are greedy I mean the</font>

629
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:10,060
comments I already dressed and then um

630
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:13,150
that's it um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the final page</font>

631
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:19,050
um I'm asking whether we could adopt

632
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:19,050
this as a workgroup draft and questions

633
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:30,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">if any if you go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous</font>

634
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:32,059
slide and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bottom one like</font>

635
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,580
whether they declared if policy should

636
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:37,250
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> included in the framework or not at</font>

637
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:40,010
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as that comment came for</font>

638
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,899
me and as I heard from others the reason

639
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,049
why I asked that is because some of us

640
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:49,120
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually working more on a you know</font>

641
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:51,889
declarative or in 10 based policy and

642
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is not part of the working group we</font>

643
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:56,299
understand that but that work may

644
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:58,909
actually benefit the working group by

645
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:01,129
the time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they get rich other than</font>

646
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:05,330
maybe do this work so it would be good

647
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:07,909
if we can see how where you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

648
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,098
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things fit in the framework so</font>

649
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:11,780
that if we do any of that work you know

650
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:14,839
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something completely</font>

651
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:18,230
different from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was in the overall</font>

652
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:20,060
concept of the policy at the super

653
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:24,010
working group that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good to have</font>

654
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why I made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comma</font>

655
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:38,480
Boris kusenov you mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> we care</font>

656
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:42,740
could you please put his address to the

657
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,829
slides Vicki address you mentioned Vicki

658
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:59,419
with you supporting we keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya ya</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are I</font>

659
00:34:45,829 --> 00:35:03,410
will put that on my list<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sir if</font>

660
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:05,390
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> no more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions the next I</font>

661
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:09,950
have one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many people have</font>

662
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:13,640
actually read this draft yes ok so

663
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:22,700
there's about 10 people there which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

664
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:24,410
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> and next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess all those people</font>

665
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:28,848
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> would support it being a</font>

666
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:36,078
working group item<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

667
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:38,720
same group yes so we will put<font color="#E5E5E5"> up as a</font>

668
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,279
working group item and run that on the

669
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,118
mailing list for another couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks</font>

670
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:48,230
before formally adopting it the next

671
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:50,450
question is of the why not for everybody

672
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:57,020
in the room how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are prepared</font>

673
00:35:50,450 --> 00:36:00,919
to review the document so this group is

674
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:07,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">not changing very much and there's a lot</font>

675
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:11,390
of authors among it well unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

676
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:15,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten alters on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document oh good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

677
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:21,470
just clarification is if you all right

678
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:24,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so that's fun for the document now</font>

679
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:27,529
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question of about declarative</font>

680
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:31,039
policy the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter does say that's</font>

681
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:33,170
out of scope but<font color="#E5E5E5"> will has raised the</font>

682
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:36,140
question of throwing in a few paragraphs

683
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:39,079
I think that's how he<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it just to</font>

684
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it a bit more complete Ben why</font>

685
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,960
could we have an area director comment

686
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,960
on that please

687
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:51,130
binocular speaking so you're right a

688
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:54,790
charter says out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope now it depends</font>

689
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:56,710
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a 40 want to</font>

690
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,509
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> two dads you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know as you mentioned</font>

691
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:01,270
it if this is a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paragraph</font>

692
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,520
telling if there is ever in 10 this is

693
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:06,730
how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works this is perfectly fine</font>

694
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,520
right if we're spending more<font color="#CCCCCC"> time on the</font>

695
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:14,410
intent of document versus the other one

696
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:17,170
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a problem right so our</font>

697
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:19,450
interpreters meaning a short section

698
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:25,750
that doesn't take too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and</font>

699
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:28,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">energy is just fine if I may be a</font>

700
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:31,030
trainer so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short section and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

701
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:33,430
if you even state explicitly in this

702
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,290
document that it has only put here to

703
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:38,379
see where it fits in the framework but

704
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:40,750
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on it I think one box</font>

705
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,599
in the in the in the picture that's in

706
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:45,910
the document would be good also to see

707
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,190
where one or two boxes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that picture</font>

708
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:51,190
where it fits in the picture as well

709
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:52,900
right I'm sure Bert will be delighted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

710
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:58,300
the authors will be happy to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

711
00:37:52,900 --> 00:38:00,220
text to make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and i'll just</font>

712
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,990
remind everybody seeing I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mic</font>

713
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,109
at the moment that what we're looking

714
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,819
for mm-hmm isn't in any other working

715
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:08,980
group is people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have prepared not</font>

716
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:12,099
just to say no we don't think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

717
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:14,079
too good all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is much too long we're</font>

718
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:16,869
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people who have will send in</font>

719
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:23,200
text to the editors so that it can be

720
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:27,609
improved<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next</font>

721
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:30,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">document which is Georges okay thank you</font>

722
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:32,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what I would like</font>

723
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:35,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to present now is the problem that the</font>

724
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,940
super<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group is working on</font>

725
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:43,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually this problem statement has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

726
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:47,560
used in many drafts previously so we are

727
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,109
also use the parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this ideas to</font>

728
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,819
actually initiate the working group but

729
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:53,590
due to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that we have received</font>

730
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:58,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments from</font>

731
00:38:53,590 --> 00:39:02,020
from many participants to actually make

732
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:04,990
this draft supporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft to show</font>

733
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:07,090
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the audience what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly super is</font>

734
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,310
doing and what exactly what is the

735
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,610
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> does so by solving that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

736
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:14,710
thought that it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good to to also</font>

737
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:18,850
try to make this draft as a working

738
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:21,670
draft so the authors have contributed to

739
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">this internet-draft can be can be seen</font>

740
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:31,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">here on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide so let's go to the</font>

741
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:34,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">demotivation so the growth of the</font>

742
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:37,629
variety and<font color="#E5E5E5"> significance of traffic that</font>

743
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:42,010
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is forwarded them needs to be</font>

744
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:46,680
supported by different complex

745
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:51,340
enterprise and and network operator

746
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,500
architectures is actually imposing very

747
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,290
much complexity and the operational

748
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,000
management tasks that have to be done in

749
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:02,050
order to maintain<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of networks</font>

750
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,270
and at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes the actually</font>

751
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:09,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initiation and deployment of new</font>

752
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:11,790
services also quite difficult so super

753
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:16,050
what actually super tries to do is to

754
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:19,120
solve this type of challenges and it's

755
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:21,850
providing specifying and policy based

756
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,700
management framework that actually

757
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:27,720
combines two main concepts one<font color="#CCCCCC"> concept</font>

758
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:31,810
concept is related to software

759
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:35,819
abstraction of networks so by doing that

760
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:39,430
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expose information about</font>

761
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:41,620
networks and about other information

762
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:45,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is needed for operational</font>

763
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:48,569
management and at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

764
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually providing type of programming</font>

765
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:58,480
programmatic control for search

766
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:00,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">operational management</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tasks so let's go</font>

767
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,520
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the status and change changes</font>

768
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:08,600
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 00 version as already mentioned</font>

769
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:10,400
this draft actually is based on the

770
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,400
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been provided in</font>

771
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,860
previous drafts so it replaces that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

772
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:19,670
to internet-drafts a term you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

773
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:22,370
there and it's actually incorporate the

774
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:24,800
super problem statement it provides

775
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:28,160
information about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value of the soup</font>

776
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:32,030
approach and it gives also<font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font>

777
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:35,029
description and examples of how how the

778
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:38,000
event condition action can be applied

779
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">for policy management and then the</font>

780
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,040
changes from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 00 version so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

781
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:48,290
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 2 version are that the newer</font>

782
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:52,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">news section</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on terminology has been has</font>

783
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:55,940
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> added and we have in an old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> section</font>

784
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:58,850
three in the previous version<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

785
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:02,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Western 00 where we describe the gap</font>

786
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:06,049
analysis and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> the related work and</font>

787
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,670
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we deleted that after the some</font>

788
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:12,650
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have received during</font>

789
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:16,310
the previous liability so let's go to

790
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:19,760
some details<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the on the problem so</font>

791
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:23,779
current service<font color="#E5E5E5"> and network operators</font>

792
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:27,100
need to operate and the support

793
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:30,020
operation of networks that are becoming

794
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:32,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">increasingly complex and they are</font>

795
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:35,230
increasing their size<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they are using</font>

796
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a multiple type of technologies</font>

797
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:44,000
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> paradigms and also a different</font>

798
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:47,000
programmatic control tools and at the

799
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,280
same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are actually deployed by</font>

800
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,950
multiple vendors and the operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

801
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,240
management actually search networks

802
00:42:53,950 --> 00:43:00,439
introduces key challenges and you can

803
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,689
see them there at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom so actually</font>

804
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:07,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network infrastructure management</font>

805
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:09,590
becomes to be more complicated the the

806
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:12,350
management of existing networks becomes

807
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:15,080
to be also<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

808
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:18,230
introduction and the deployment of new

809
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:21,500
services also become<font color="#E5E5E5"> so complicated</font>

810
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:23,869
and in addition to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but now when we</font>

811
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:27,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">have this new emerging technologies like</font>

812
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:32,150
sdn nav it's also quite difficult to

813
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:34,339
somehow introduce them and to use to be

814
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:39,109
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the existing operation and</font>

815
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:41,470
management ecosystem so then the super

816
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:44,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">what super tries to do then is to</font>

817
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:46,459
somehow solve these challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

818
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:51,020
mentioned by specifying specifying and

819
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:54,230
policy based framework and this is

820
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:56,119
actually done by providing an unified

821
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:58,190
technology independent operation

822
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:01,609
management framework so this will

823
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:03,290
actually simplify and provide a more

824
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:07,130
efficient way of how operators can

825
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:09,590
manage their network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is also may</font>

826
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:12,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">be important to note that super focuses</font>

827
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,869
on the old management policies that are

828
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:18,850
interpreted<font color="#E5E5E5"> externally to the network</font>

829
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:22,670
elements or not not internal and

830
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:26,180
actually this interpretation can mean

831
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:29,630
that typically we resulting

832
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:31,460
configuration changes on our group of

833
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,619
network elements or not on one

834
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:40,220
individual element but on a collection

835
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:44,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">of network elements so here we have four</font>

836
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:47,480
key violence and benefits of super so

837
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,180
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important is that it</font>

838
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,790
provides<font color="#CCCCCC"> in vendor and Technology</font>

839
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:55,129
independent policy framework and then

840
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:58,009
this will help actually the network

841
00:44:55,130 --> 00:45:01,810
management and at the same time to

842
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:04,690
simplify and optimize the way of how

843
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:07,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">operational management</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be performed</font>

844
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:09,440
then the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the unified</font>

845
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:13,810
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> for structure policy management</font>

846
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:16,820
so by by doing that we provide means to

847
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:20,029
operators to have an unified way of

848
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:24,619
managing methods by use it by using this

849
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:27,200
policy framework and and then the third

850
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:30,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">one is real and this is an important one</font>

851
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,180
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time an event based network</font>

852
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:34,099
management so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

853
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:37,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for structure</font>

854
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:40,940
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> adopted it could be changed</font>

855
00:45:37,089 --> 00:45:43,578
based on some context that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is monitored</font>

856
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">by this policy at the current moment in</font>

857
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:49,550
time so depending on things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

858
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:52,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening dynamically the infrastructure</font>

859
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:55,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">would also and the configuration of this</font>

860
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,828
attraction can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be changed can be adapted</font>

861
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,750
and then the fourth value is the new

862
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:02,150
independent network manager management

863
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:05,720
policy layer so what we mean with that

864
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:08,809
is that we included a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of policy</font>

865
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,868
layer between the service network

866
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:14,290
providers and the subscribers and

867
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:16,450
provide to them in a way if the

868
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:21,410
achieving a unified and shield

869
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:25,098
management and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's also</font>

870
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:28,220
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> note that different actors</font>

871
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:31,790
can make use of this of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this policy and</font>

872
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:34,368
these actors could be developers would

873
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:38,720
be network<font color="#E5E5E5"> administrators it could be</font>

874
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:40,579
applications that that can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

875
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:47,118
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of policy rules on different</font>

876
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:50,210
abstraction levels and another important

877
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:53,329
characteristic that this poor benefit is

878
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:55,579
the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy framework could</font>

879
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:59,030
provide awesome operation and management

880
00:46:55,579 --> 00:47:02,000
interface that would be used and enable

881
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:03,790
the existing idea of data models that

882
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
actually are being defined in different

883
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:10,670
ITF working groups and then define a way

884
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,020
of how they could be managed in a

885
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:18,710
unified unified way and also being

886
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:23,869
independent of technology vendors and

887
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:27,380
application domain and then here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

888
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:30,619
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the draft who have four examples</font>

889
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:33,290
that show how the event condition actual

890
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:35,869
policy is used<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go only through the</font>

891
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:38,270
first one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

892
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:39,950
network service management and we are

893
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:43,819
using as network service in this case

894
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:45,439
the LC VPN and what you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

895
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:50,270
that the event

896
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:53,119
is shown it happens at the moment that

897
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:56,930
alarms and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron notifications are being</font>

898
00:47:53,119 --> 00:48:00,500
received from an<font color="#E5E5E5"> LC VPN service then as</font>

899
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:03,140
condition under the condition that this

900
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:06,079
error notifications are coming from from

901
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:10,129
one interface within a period of time

902
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:12,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the action will be that if if</font>

903
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:15,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> error they are rate and that</font>

904
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:18,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually is monitored exceeds some limit</font>

905
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:21,410
then something will happen and what will

906
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:24,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen here is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this l3 VPN will go</font>

907
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:27,319
into error state and then also the users

908
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:31,069
that are using this<font color="#CCCCCC"> at 3pm service will</font>

909
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:36,859
migrate to another l3 VPN one or more

910
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:41,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">lgb pm's so i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skip this other three</font>

911
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:42,770
and i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next steps so we</font>

912
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:44,839
receive comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> balance on the main</font>

913
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:46,640
linux as i mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> previously so we</font>

914
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:49,880
receive comments on the mailing list

915
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:53,900
that having this problem statement

916
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:57,109
Raftis is useful because then we can

917
00:48:53,900 --> 00:49:02,210
show to the ordinate audience what what

918
00:48:57,109 --> 00:49:03,589
supports actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and in</font>

919
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:07,700
addition to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we receive comments</font>

920
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:09,770
that we should bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> back the the gap</font>

921
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:13,180
analysis and the related work but then

922
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:15,140
use it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> d in the appendix of the draft</font>

923
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,390
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if there are any</font>

924
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:20,078
objections on that so that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

925
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:23,029
question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the second question is</font>

926
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:26,990
the proposed to make this list rafters

927
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:30,260
and super working according to graph so

928
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:32,799
thank you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your fashions I'm happy</font>

929
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take them</font>

930
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:42,788
bill from Holly this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually on</font>

931
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:47,289
that piece of comments is<font color="#E5E5E5"> out from me</font>

932
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:49,599
and I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that um because um when</font>

933
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:52,750
we're doing this work there long I mean

934
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,240
there is long time ago so maybe if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

935
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:57,730
wanted to I mean if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add the</font>

936
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:00,250
gap analysis I mean in a summarized

937
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:02,349
diversion and you need to look at look

938
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:04,299
at it what her I mean what<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

939
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:07,119
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nowadays I mean not only</font>

940
00:50:04,299 --> 00:50:09,609
two to two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those parts</font>

941
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:17,740
are I mean he kind of come out a date

942
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:20,950
yeah bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> odaro</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> McConnell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enamel</font>

943
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:24,069
quarter of internet draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm kind</font>

944
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:29,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">of quartering wondering what purpose</font>

945
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:32,049
really the gap analysis observes at this

946
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:34,930
point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time especially for adopt it as</font>

947
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:37,480
a working group item is over Wisconsin

948
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:39,970
School to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because it was a very</font>

949
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,400
useful tool while where things are both

950
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:45,269
and trying to identify what are the

951
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:50,950
problems the problem space to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

952
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:59,740
but and now it's it also is you Sadie

953
00:50:50,950 --> 00:51:02,368
it's a it's a Oh changing environment so

954
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:05,348
it will in one year<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will be different</font>

955
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:07,450
one year after publication it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

956
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:10,240
different so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what purpose</font>

957
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:14,640
it will serve yeah I'm also not sure

958
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:18,910
about that so just waiting for comments

959
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:23,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you George S</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd said just a</font>

960
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:27,098
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of observations the first is I've</font>

961
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:28,089
seen some comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the list that it</font>

962
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:31,180
would be nice to have a problem

963
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:33,609
statement it's still a little unclear to

964
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:35,200
me is to kind of what purpose this this

965
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:36,940
document is going to serve because we're

966
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,129
we're working on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution already</font>

967
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:43,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data models we've got the</font>

968
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:46,660
information model there was a comment

969
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:47,089
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter maybe wasn't clear or</font>

970
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,950
come

971
00:51:47,089 --> 00:51:52,430
to enough and and this document

972
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:56,239
certainly provides a very good deep sort

973
00:51:52,430 --> 00:52:00,109
of perspective of why we're here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and why</font>

974
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:01,999
super was instantiating it's written and

975
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:04,308
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> available and it's enshrined in</font>

976
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:06,919
that in the data tracker anyway do we

977
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:08,599
actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue to work and</font>

978
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:12,019
develop this document and actually

979
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:15,109
publish you know as a formal your RFC

980
00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:17,718
because you you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopt the the</font>

981
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:20,598
document so that's that's question that

982
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:27,469
I would have and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we need to ask</font>

983
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:30,200
the working group your love is formally

984
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:31,999
my understanding of adopting the doing

985
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,950
the document simply that the group

986
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:35,899
things that is useful doesn't guarantee

987
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:39,919
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be an iratze here people</font>

988
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:44,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">reproduce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever and websites</font>

989
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:46,700
vulnerable to that extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

990
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:50,288
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopting it but asking the</font>

991
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:54,589
other to take this is slow down and if

992
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:57,739
some cases this could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful as an</font>

993
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:59,359
introductory material for something some

994
00:52:57,739 --> 00:53:02,569
other documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be my</font>

recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Frank Thank You Diego</font>

996
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:06,829
this is joel Halpern I was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

997
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,680
basically the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with one</font>

refinement one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantages of</font>

adopting it is that we then make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1000
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:16,788
that the content reflects the working

1001
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:19,609
groups preferences the working groups

1002
00:53:16,789 --> 00:53:21,739

else has not been involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> here comes</font>

1005
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:27,259
what they're seeing is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> authors</font>

1006
00:53:24,799 --> 00:53:29,239
understand if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopt it and we put in</font>

1007
00:53:27,259 --> 00:53:32,749
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of the effort needed to fix</font>

1008
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:34,910
it it's ours<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody coming in sees</font>

1009
00:53:32,749 --> 00:53:37,759
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups understanding</font>

1010
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:39,499
whether we publish it as an RFC whole

1011
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:41,690
different question we can decide that

1012
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:45,200
down the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very useful</font>

1013
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:47,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us and to those work going forward to</font>

1014
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,399
have the document so I'm just I'm

1015
00:53:47,509 --> 00:53:52,910
cognizant that we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited number</font>

1016
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:55,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">of resources and people participating in</font>

1017
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:58,368
super and I don't want to dilute the

1018
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:59,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">effort by having too many documents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1019
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:00,859
are working sort of we're working on

1020
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:03,019
concurrently

1021
00:54:00,859 --> 00:54:04,970
there's a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have this document</font>

1022
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:06,890
that's going to feed into some of the

1023
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:08,538
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the milestones the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter</font>

1024
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:11,049
items that we specifically stated when

1025
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:13,069
we created the working group I'm

1026
00:54:11,049 --> 00:54:18,339
interested also to hit been<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's</font>

1027
00:54:13,069 --> 00:54:21,499
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he Trump's please</font>

1028
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:24,410
confirm from<font color="#CCCCCC"> telling telecom I think</font>

1029
00:54:21,499 --> 00:54:27,769
this document will provide some provide

1030
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:30,769
some guidance on about how to use soap

1031
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:34,578
adding the network in the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what</font>

1032
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:38,709
kind of scenario would can use case so I

1033
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:42,769
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be very variable to</font>

1034
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:46,450
before I would for our network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font>

1035
00:54:42,769 --> 00:54:50,720
that it can be adopting the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1036
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:52,730
thanks so that's probably true so we

1037
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,709
need to become an applicability document

1038
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:56,509
or change it from here's a problem

1039
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:59,390
statement make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

1040
00:54:56,509 --> 00:55:00,799
be valuable that people picking this up

1041
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:03,410
would then understand how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font>

1042
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,788
these cases whatever so my

1043
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:07,190
recommendation would be the change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1044
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:09,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that life may it may may say something</font>

1045
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:11,720
we have already in Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> mediated</font>

1046
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:14,390
document but we could not submit it in

1047
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:18,589
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have enough like a really</font>

1048
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:20,269
document that will actually describe the

1049
00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:24,170
examples and more examples that I

1050
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:25,999
presented in a more<font color="#CCCCCC"> sand as I fold this</font>

1051
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:28,460
into that or whatever right how do I

1052
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:29,868
have so so we have an applica bility

1053
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,099
document we have a problem statement

1054
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:34,519
document we have a framework document

1055
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:37,369
yeah that's that's a lot of documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1056
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:39,319
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd be much more comfortable if we</font>

1057
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:42,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">were to look at you know where we can</font>

1058
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:44,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually merge this effort and keep keep</font>

1059
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:46,789
the text<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have you know a</font>

1060
00:55:44,059 --> 00:55:48,349
document to documents rather than you

1061
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:50,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">know three documents at this stage plus</font>

1062
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:55,970
the information model plus the data

1063
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:58,519
model but um as soon okiya my statement

1064
00:55:55,970 --> 00:56:00,649
goes actually in a similar direction the

1065
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:02,508
document title says problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement</font>

1066
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:06,230
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i heard or there is a need for an</font>

1067
00:56:02,509 --> 00:56:10,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of you there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain</font>

1068
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:12,710
how to use super both of these does not

1069
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:14,609
fit actually on the problem statement in

1070
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:17,220
problem statement i would like to see

1071
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:20,420
what the problem is so we need to kind

1072
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:24,288
of decide what kind of documents we need

1073
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:27,420
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address what is required</font>

1074
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:29,549
it there seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be some additional</font>

1075
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:35,039
information required which goes beyond

1076
00:56:29,549 --> 00:56:37,170
problem statement but not less so the

1077
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:40,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">last three person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stressing</font>

1078
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:44,519
the need on stressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the need to</font>

1079
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:46,859
document how we apply super and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

1080
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:48,868
son's exactly the content of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Napa kept</font>

1081
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:51,089
these statements which is the Charter

1082
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:54,900
which says you take one or two use cases

1083
00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:57,390
and then you explain our super works for

1084
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:00,539
these use cases I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that we are</font>

1086
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:04,559

1087
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:07,170
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a problem we know about</font>

1088
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:10,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">that right so I don't see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> value of</font>

1089
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:12,720
actually publishing this we recognize

1090
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:15,538
there's a problem right what is the

1091
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:23,009
solution is way more interesting it

1092
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:24,599
might mean like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1093
00:57:23,009 --> 00:57:26,549
have to cut the line of that sorry but

1094
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:29,609
let's let's move this discussion to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:57:26,549 --> 00:57:34,470
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> georgius</font>

1097
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:43,019
you have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the time remaining</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1098
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:45,839
the working group session it's rajesh

kumar from<font color="#E5E5E5"> juniper network and i just</font>

1100
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give background I just started</font>

1101
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:54,180
ending up IDF and as juniper we're

1102
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:56,308
developing security controller and I

1103
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:58,348
have some interest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ID on us half</font>

1104
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:59,849
and looked at the talked a lot of

1105
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:02,910
customers so one of the challenge which

1106
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:04,829
we have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the security policy</font>

1107
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:07,049
configuration is a very complex tasks

1108
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:09,630
and if you have a multi-vendor solution

1109
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:11,788
and virtualized non-virtual I legacy is

1110
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:13,680
rach router firewall this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1111
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:17,609
complicated topic so how do we really

1112
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:19,649
make the so that the customers can

1113
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:21,210
really use the system whether we call

1114
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:23,220
the controller management system that

1115
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">does math to be but how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you provide</font>

1116
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:28,020
interfaces to the northbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> side or to</font>

1117
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:29,520
the OSS BSS application

1118
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:34,950
or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to call that and</font>

1119
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:37,140
make those interfaces so that it does

1120
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:40,109
not matter how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bill what</font>

1121
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:42,540
the topology is and which where they

1122
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:44,070
special function physical function or

1123
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,110
whether the function would we<font color="#CCCCCC"> realized</font>

1124
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:47,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that switches routers stuff like that so</font>

1125
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:50,010
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the background</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that so I was</font>

1126
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:52,560
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the chair of I to NSF and</font>

1127
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:55,710
then we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to chair of soup and they</font>

1128
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:58,279
suggested<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I could use the policy</font>

1129
00:58:55,710 --> 00:59:00,300
framework which is defined in super to

1130
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,010
use that for the client facing

1131
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,170
interfaces so I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through</font>

1132
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:06,540
a little bit background<font color="#E5E5E5"> toward I Trojans</font>

1133
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:08,340
we are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and how i see i can</font>

1134
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:10,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">use supa to fulfill those requirements</font>

1135
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">so just bear with me for a few minutes</font>

1136
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,490
so gender<font color="#CCCCCC"> talks as security controller</font>

1137
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:17,069
architecture to be this is just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1138
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:19,169
service functions which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined in</font>

1139
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:21,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem statement could be any</font>

1140
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:23,040
service layer and service layer could

1141
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:24,660
provide basically a policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for interface</font>

1142
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,550
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go through security control</font>

1143
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:28,649
architecture what is the I<font color="#CCCCCC"> tunas</font>

1144
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:30,570
framework we have defined and then there

1145
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:32,760
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tunas of mind facing interfaces</font>

1146
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,620
where I think if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can leverage super</font>

1147
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,330
policy driven framework that with the

1148
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:38,700
great thing and the draft we have

1149
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:40,890
proposed that in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iTunes framework</font>

1150
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,080
which captures on the requirement so

1151
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:44,339
very quickly in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion what we're</font>

1152
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,920
trying to do is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is security</font>

1153
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:49,530
controller which really trying to

1154
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">abstract all that details whether it's a</font>

1155
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:55,110
physical virtual or whether it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

1156
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:57,029
event of the devices security controller

1157
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:58,800
is going to manage all the thing going

1158
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:01,920
south one side so we are calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> din I</font>

1159
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:04,890
to NSF NSF facing interface right so NSF

1160
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,540
face interface understand that that a

1161
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:08,400
particular capability exists in a

1162
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,540
network security function and there

1163
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,330
could be another layer of abstraction

1164
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:14,220
which would happen where this NSF

1165
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:15,779
interface are generic so it doesn't

1166
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:18,120
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> these blue box that a virtual</font>

1167
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:19,980
function a physical function or router

1168
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:24,509
or a switch or a specific vendor

1169
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:26,250
firewall or networking element and on

1170
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:28,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> node mon side or on the client side</font>

1171
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:30,660
that's what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to say if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1172
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,009
can drink those interfaces like like I

1173
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,810
said earlier security is already

1174
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:35,280
configured using policy and right now

1175
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:38,190
there's a vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> spaces policy like</font>

1176
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,600
jennifer has cisco has<font color="#CCCCCC"> barbare 49</font>

1177
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:41,880
followers with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors there</font>

1178
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,560
they have their own specific way to

1179
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,540
for each device and<font color="#CCCCCC"> those security</font>

1180
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,220
policy in itself are very complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1181
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:50,520
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of understanding of</font>

1182
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:53,100
networking device how the topology is so

1183
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,259
the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is how to use work which</font>

1184
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,779
is done in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sofa and to make end</font>

1185
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:00,470
customer or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user like fixing that's</font>

1186
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:03,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole idea behind this so there is a</font>

1187
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:05,189
what we are saying is in the eye to SF

1188
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:06,840
the client interface I just explained

1189
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:09,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is security control inspector the</font>

1190
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:11,700
client and what our idea is we don't

1191
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care like like I know people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1192
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about I just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say one</font>

1193
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:17,520
line about this user intent what we're

1194
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:18,930
calling that I know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> word has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

1195
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,450
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different meaning to different folks</font>

1196
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:23,730
what we mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by user intent and that's</font>

1197
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:25,980
why i was talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bill earlier is we</font>

1198
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:27,510
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to boil the ocean what we</font>

1199
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:30,690
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can solve a simple</font>

1200
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:32,460
problem just like and customer want to

1201
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:34,860
program a policy based on the user group

1202
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:36,150
access let's say in any enterprise and

1203
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,680
they have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department you could</font>

1204
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,570
have legal department you have finance

1205
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,060
department and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to say that</font>

1206
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:44,010
users which belong to finance department

1207
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:46,380
or HR department they cannot have

1208
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:48,060
application access or the data access in

1209
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,920
a different department I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1210
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">very typical security policy of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dribble</font>

1211
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,270
it applies that so to us that is in 10

1212
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:56,220
do you want to program a security policy

1213
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:58,470
based on figuring out hey what is the

1214
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:00,270
user IP address is given instance of

1215
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:02,040
time or where the application is

1216
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:04,530
deployed what is IP address the given

1217
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,420
time and if the application change or

1218
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:09,000
the application move is IP address say

1219
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:11,190
to the user can somebody has subtracted

1220
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,650
and reconfigure the policy so the bottom

1221
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:16,050
line is what user want not what the

1222
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:18,570
device capabilities from the CLI

1223
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:21,480
perspective from the five tuple sixth of

1224
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:22,950
all user<font color="#CCCCCC"> sadies hey I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have HR group</font>

1225
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,890
I don't know give access to this

1226
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:28,049
application group so it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

1227
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:29,430
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to provide this natural</font>

1228
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:31,800
language processing what we're saying is

1229
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:34,080
how to model<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intent into the client</font>

1230
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,120
interfaces so when we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about intent</font>

1231
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,460
that's what I mean here so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1232
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:41,009
thing is like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in the problem</font>

1233
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:44,190
statements you present if that that it

1234
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:45,660
should be network topology unaware when

1235
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:47,580
clients say that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

1236
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:50,430
whether that NSF is where it is located

1237
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how it is broke and we wanted</font>

1238
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:55,200
leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> super policy interface there so</font>

1239
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:57,660
these are other user intent modeling

1240
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,759
and the idea was here is these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1241
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,529
intent which we think would useful to

1242
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,740
create for the northbound or the client

1243
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:07,170
facing interfaces and if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use super</font>

1244
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">based policy to model this thing that</font>

1245
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:10,920
would be great so some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these thing is</font>

1246
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:13,050
Mara data-driven so as I said earlier

1247
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,880
user intent could remodel just hey Mara

1248
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:17,220
data-driven needs to prime the fixed IP

1249
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,950
address so manner data could be related

1250
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:21,959
to user's device application locations

1251
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:23,939
and the group definition could come from

1252
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,859
anywhere sao paulo she should be able to

1253
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,869
capture those<font color="#E5E5E5"> details hey I want to</font>

1254
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:30,450
define a specific group and the identity

1255
01:03:27,869 --> 01:03:33,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that groups come from some system and</font>

1256
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:34,618
then next thing is policy modeling

1257
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:37,020
requirement what does user really want

1258
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:39,329
to create a policy or when he wants this

1259
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:41,579
policy to enforce<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can call the event</font>

1260
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:43,710
condition actions or we can call<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

1261
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:45,599
more sophisticated one where user

1262
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:47,339
defines hey I want my policy to be

1263
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,410
active when I consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or the user</font>

1264
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">crusader</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to define of time</font>

1265
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:53,190
profile and based on the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> profiles</font>

1266
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,109
policy or Connecticut<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene so you don't</font>

1267
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:56,940
have to do those manual tasks you can

1268
01:03:55,109 --> 01:03:58,069
automate<font color="#CCCCCC"> their or you can say that hey I</font>

1269
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:00,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to create a more sophisticated</font>

1270
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:02,670
system where based on certain event I

1271
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:04,950
see coming from differences different

1272
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:06,780
system or I have analytics engines which

1273
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:09,450
give me event doesn't matter how they

1274
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:12,839
went happens I want to use those even to

1275
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:14,669
drive my policy enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

1276
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:16,980
thing is what what user want in rules

1277
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:18,930
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said earlier he's going to build</font>

1278
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,420
ruled on the building blocks of the

1279
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:22,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">object which we are going to define like</font>

1280
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:25,170
you have like I said there you have

1281
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,700
