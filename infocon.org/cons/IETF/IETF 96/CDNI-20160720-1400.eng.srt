142
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,589
memory we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to document that</font>

143
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,329
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> your I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signing one is</font>

144
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,870
currently a working group document which

145
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:37,930
defines you are i signing for let's say

146
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:41,410
non segmented content and then we have a

147
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,449
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> that discusses I guess</font>

148
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:48,430
extensions to that to deal with adaptive

149
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:50,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">straining and there's some IPR update</font>

150
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,550
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that document which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

151
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:57,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented in details now there's two</font>

152
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:00,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">pieces of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work that are beyond our</font>

153
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,339
charter or at least beyond the milestone

154
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,490
the list of milestones i should say one

155
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:09,130
is a city in Iraq pacing we just talked

156
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,380
to the main author of that document and

157
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:15,120
you know he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for the key</font>

158
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,960
specs to finalize the rate pacing

159
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,620
document itself is quite

160
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:25,530
it's basically a small extension which

161
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:28,660
allows the ability to request that a CDN

162
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">paces when you delivers a piece of</font>

163
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,860
content so rather than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

164
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,199
stream as fast as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible you can tell</font>

165
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,010
that CDN well you know don't go faster

166
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,450
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of right which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

167
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,310
capability that exists in some Syrians

168
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,700
and would be interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in our</font>

169
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,849
CDN I solution so Matt the main author

170
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,160
has agreed to you know read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document</font>

171
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,680
up now that the key specs are frozen and

172
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,910
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an update and I guess we</font>

173
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,500
take it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there see if we want to</font>

174
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the document and get</font>

175
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,580
it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in any case it's</font>

176
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:05,550
fairly you know contain<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple document</font>

177
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:11,640
but we won't talk more about it today

178
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:17,819
about HTTPS delegation you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

179
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:22,140
um I guess evolving as the the

180
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:25,210
background work inside ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> evos</font>

181
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,490
Frederick had written a new document on

182
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:31,090
that topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and which was discussing how</font>

183
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:33,990
luck could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used for CDN I and you</font>

184
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:37,450
know there's been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot bath with some</font>

185
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:41,980
likely directions and for the lake will

186
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:44,020
update us about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so that's a I</font>

187
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,180
think on a half for the document status

188
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,010
is there any any question comments on

189
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:57,520
the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they are on high</font>

190
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:59,110
level no good we can yeah actually well

191
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:04,319
that's true<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we can we can share</font>

192
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,320
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big so did you</font>

193
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,008
that document<font color="#CCCCCC"> was sort of I was</font>

194
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,699
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it already how to</font>

195
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:29,529
document what is that goes now given

196
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:31,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dessert in itself do not take off</font>

197
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:33,790
with you know and this whole different

198
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,130
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't call it here and why they</font>

199
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,870
do not they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got let you know but there</font>

200
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,769
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good work down there including</font>

201
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:44,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CD and I HTTPS navigation so della</font>

202
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:46,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">document gets 40 years from now or what</font>

203
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,120
happens I think Frederick's going to

204
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:51,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">present on that at the end he's got an</font>

205
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,670
agenda slot so um if we can talk about

206
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,649
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> then and see what his direction is</font>

207
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,029
for the document yeah so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

208
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:01,240
discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> that exact question you raised</font>

209
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:04,269
but sort of once<font color="#E5E5E5"> Frederick has presenter</font>

210
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:09,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">the update of a nice document good</font>

211
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:13,180
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the</font>

212
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:15,670
agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the first document to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

213
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:23,410
presented his mates Adena meet at a time

214
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:24,639
Kevin will do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us but you don't</font>

215
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:29,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to send someone from you take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

216
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:33,850
yeah so I'm just gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just gonna</font>

217
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:35,829
sit if that's okay with everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

218
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:39,790
there were a bunch of new revisions

219
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:43,239
since the last IETF most of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

220
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:46,930
based off of early comments from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad</font>

221
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:51,009
and all of the iesg comments that we got

222
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:53,638
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put out six new revisions we're</font>

223
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:56,589
planning to do one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the the</font>

224
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">remainder of the things done I just</font>

225
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:02,620
couldn't get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all in before the draft</font>

226
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,449
deadline so we put up a draft 19 we

227
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,750
removed all the dot V ones as we

228
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:10,329
discussed in Buenos Aires and I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

229
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:13,630
clarify the versioning text it's not so

230
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:15,880
much versioning as we need to know what

231
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,470
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the spec these objects were</font>

232
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,240
defined in so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to clean that up</font>

233
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,589
we added<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text about different</font>

234
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,699
threats to the security considerations

235
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:31,029
that were brought up by security a DS we

236
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:32,660
fixed all the must text must use text

237
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:35,050
around TLS so that the

238
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,850
looks the same as triggers and logging

239
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,279
those both went through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of review</font>

240
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:44,209
and I think we're all happy with that

241
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:48,430
now there were a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

242
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:52,819
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s about why we have an empty</font>

243
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,800
you are ice are you off object and I

244
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:57,430
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clarify i added some text in</font>

245
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,040
there saying that in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference to the</font>

246
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,899
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> uri signing document though if</font>

247
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,819
there's an informative reference to your

248
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:06,560
i signing document does that hold up its

249
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:09,110
publication and therefore hold up all

250
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:31,910
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are waiting for</font>

251
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:34,069
it yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay went</font>

252
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:37,160
through and added a bunch of references

253
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:39,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and fixed a bunch of examples added more</font>

254
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,500
examples and fixed a bunch of random

255
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,509
typos and grammar problems there's a

256
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,579
bullet down here about<font color="#CCCCCC"> alexys last</font>

257
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,529
comment which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to about</font>

258
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:51,800
yesterday and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we'll have fixed</font>

259
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:54,649
shortly after the draft updates reopened

260
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,910
it was about which methods were allowed

261
00:15:54,649 --> 00:16:03,399
to use get and head versus post in all

262
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,399
the rest but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll clean up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that text</font>

263
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,888
there were two kind of big decisions

264
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,329
that were made as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were reviewed</font>

265
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:14,569
revising the document that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

266
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:16,550
make the working group aware of we

267
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:19,189
remove the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I metadata authtype</font>

268
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,258
registry so we got a lot of questions as

269
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:22,819
to why there's an empty registry and the

270
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:24,800
answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> why there's an empty registry</font>

271
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:27,019
is because you are I signings not done

272
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,870
yet and has<font color="#E5E5E5"> it populated it but in</font>

273
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:32,360
looking at it some more we didn't

274
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:35,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually need the auth type registry the</font>

275
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:39,439
reason we had it was before we went to

276
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,969
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> P types for all our objects we had</font>

277
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:43,490
separate registries for the different

278
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,170
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of metadata objects and this one's</font>

279
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:49,070
just kind of left over for off

<font color="#CCCCCC">Jack's so since every object is now in</font>

281
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,680
the p-type registry we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

282
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,860
need a shadow registry a duplicate

283
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,599
registry just for auth objects so we

284
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,160
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remove it unless anyone has</font>

285
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,839
any thoughts on that if anyone objects

286
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,750
and thinks we really need a second

287
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:16,899
registry to register the auth objects

288
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:19,780
twice please speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> now okay the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

289
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:22,309
comment that came from alyssa was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

290
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:26,660
for all of our ACL objects we have a

291
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:29,059
default of deny and the whole list is a

292
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,980
deny so you have to explicitly put in

293
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:34,639
and allow if you want and allow for the

294
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,140
ACL we did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for safety reasons so</font>

295
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,299
that you couldn't screw it up by just

296
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">forgetting to put that in the JSON or</font>

297
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:43,160
forgetting to specify it we felt that

298
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,740
that's the better way to go and that

299
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,230
having to put allowing the JSON didn't

300
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,950
really add that much more overhead but

301
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,870
if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a strong performance issue</font>

302
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,410
with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> requiring you to put the word</font>

303
00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:01,729
allow in we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take that</font>

304
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:03,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">into consideration I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

305
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:09,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as a no and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to keep</font>

306
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:11,450
that so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one open issue that we</font>

307
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,380
have that I found when I was revising

308
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:19,010
the versioning section the structural

309
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:23,000
metadata does not have explicit versions

310
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:26,210
in the JSON and originally we didn't

311
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,890
have extensibility for the structural

312
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,650
metadata at all but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now they all have</font>

313
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:36,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">p-type so they all technically have some</font>

314
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:39,860
type of version associated with them so

315
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that came up was you know</font>

316
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,370
do we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have explicit versions do</font>

317
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,299
you need to be able to link two

318
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:49,070
different versions and understand it I

319
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:50,690
don't know if we care I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

320
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,340
really care but we could add some<font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font>

321
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

322
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">change structural metadata it should</font>

323
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,400
never have to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you do</font>

324
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,710
please change them also that it's co

325
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,940
here

326
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:06,390
it that would be my preference but if we

327
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,580
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some way make inside the</font>

328
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">JSON explicit what the p-type is for</font>

329
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,289
each of the structural objects we could

330
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:18,740
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't know if anyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here has</font>

331
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:22,980
an opinion if not i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to say</font>

332
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,870
structural objects are their version

333
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,640
them as a group if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever want to</font>

334
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,879
change this be very careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to screw</font>

335
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,190
up the pad stuff and just do them all if

336
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:38,010
no one has any problem with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

337
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:42,539
send an email to the list as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

338
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for next steps on the</font>

339
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:49,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">document I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and finish up</font>

340
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:53,730
the edits that are in my to-do list and

341
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:56,059
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think we're good to go and</font>

342
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:06,450
then we'll send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Alexei</font>

343
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:10,139
said metadata you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Mike so we are</font>

344
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,000
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main issue was that the</font>

345
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,649
word down drafts which I didn't call out

346
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,260
in ITF last call because I didn't get

347
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:21,389
the shepherding right up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

348
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:26,100
check myself so I think collectively

349
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:27,659
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> our fault so anyway I'm I think all</font>

350
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,000
of your changes I'll just double check

351
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:33,600
that it's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly</font>

352
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,649
significant I don't think more most

353
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,830
realistic case is i'll just email is<font color="#E5E5E5"> g</font>

354
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:42,689
saying there are some minor changes to

355
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,779
the document he already all approved it

356
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,190
I'll just to prove it you know please

357
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:50,279
object within a day or something like

358
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,200
that so one realistically posting new

359
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:53,909
version i'll double check it and it

360
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:59,659
probably approved very shortly after

361
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:59,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">them thank you</font>

362
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:16,620
it's me up again so we had the

363
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,690
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> information on the footprint</font>

365
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,990
over this is my original capabilities

366
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:30,660
draft that we had decided was going to

367
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:35,040
contain the object definitions for CD

368
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:37,050
and I'm capabilities there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been two</font>

369
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,350
revs I've been trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it in line</font>

370
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:42,570
with metadata as we meditate and logging

371
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:46,740
as we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been revising them through the</font>

372
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:51,270
iesg comments so here's a list of

373
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:55,350
changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I updated a lot of the stuff</font>

374
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:56,820
related to P types but then also as we

375
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,980
went through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg comments on</font>

376
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,179
semantics we changed it from

377
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,770
informational to proposed standard and

378
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,450
moved a lot of the object definitions

379
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,760
into their originally just<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a base</font>

380
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,010
object but it was kind of wonky cuz had

381
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,840
the base object but<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe stuff then</font>

382
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,730
didn't tell you what was describing so

383
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,939
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just moved most of that stuff into</font>

384
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:20,160
there and that's ready to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and just</font>

385
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,910
waiting on metadata which is going to be

386
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">waiting on your i signing but the only</font>

387
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,890
thing that's actually left in there

388
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,830
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some additional footprint</font>

389
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:36,570
types for alto and the registration of

390
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:41,939
the alto media types that that are still

391
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:43,800
left so as as next steps<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still need to</font>

392
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,980
update those with the latest changes

393
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:50,669
that happen to metadata last week and

394
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,920
then the security considerations section

395
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:56,670
is out of date as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

396
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,710
update<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but ultimately I think at</font>

397
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:01,440
this point yawns up next but yeah and

398
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been talking about how we can merge</font>

399
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,940
the two drafts together now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot</font>

400
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,560
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CDN I specific stuff is moved to</font>

401
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,600
semantics and most of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alto</font>

402
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,240
specific it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it makes more</font>

403
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have it in one draft but I'm</font>

404
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:20,520
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hand it over to yan this moment</font>

405
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:21,840
slide okay said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I really</font>

406
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,629
have your draft name wrong with my

407
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,669
slides but I guess it's fine i'll upload

408
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,630
the matter all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll give them a</font>

409
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:32,340
cure but knows so yeah then there's an

410
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,190
expired draft called zero CDN request

411
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,830
routing Alto which is the one you were

412
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,660
just talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so next slide and so</font>

413
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a reminder and we haven't been</font>

414
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,230
talking about this for for y so here's

415
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,000
just a reminder of the history<font color="#E5E5E5"> we used</font>

416
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,190
to have three documents one was the

417
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,440
semantics draft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then Kevin had a</font>

418
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,300
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that specifies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the JSON object and</font>

419
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,090
I had a draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifies how to</font>

420
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,909
transport that JSON object the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fci</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason</font>

421
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:59,760
object via al Joe as kevin was just

422
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:01,230
mentioning and very up to now we were

423
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,790
basically focusing on the

424
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">semantic strap you wanted to get that</font>

425
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,810
one done so we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't</font>

426
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">updated this draft and quite a while you</font>

427
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,260
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently started to update yours</font>

428
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:15,510
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we were focusing on that</font>

429
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:17,460
one so next slide now that one is done

430
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:20,040
the semantics document and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

431
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,500
same time originally we thought it would

432
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">be an informational document but in the</font>

433
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,890
process it turned out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font>

434
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,490
was actually explicit feedback from the

435
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">isg right so they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually told us and</font>

436
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,550
why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you move all the</font>

437
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,199
specifications into that document which

438
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:37,320
basically makes your document now very

439
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,730
skinny so to speak and that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

440
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">the idea we both agree on this we should</font>

441
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,990
merge these two documents because all

442
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,600
that's really need to all that's left<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

443
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,970
be done is really specify the transport

444
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,469
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON object the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fci JSON object</font>

445
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,260
that's specified in this document that's

446
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:55,170
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the RFC editor editor queue</font>

447
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,640
and yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we want to get</font>

448
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,410
down so we want to merge these documents

449
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,970
and I think we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to discuss any</font>

450
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,410
more that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to be a new</font>

451
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">algin service because that we have</font>

452
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,110
discussed and agreed on in the working

453
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,840
group previously your document also

454
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,189
talks about also all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and so</font>

455
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,320
another question that came up with

456
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,150
should we continue this work in the CDN

457
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">I working group or in the outer working</font>

458
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,680
we are currently discussing with the air

459
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:19,650
directors and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an email thread on</font>

460
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,360
that and probably mere<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mayor was the</font>

461
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,090
area director for alto needs to decide

462
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,060
this more than you I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

463
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:29,040
talking to her and yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

464
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,040
strong feelings but again remind

465
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,290
mind yourself the JSON object is really

466
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:37,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">see deny specific and we did the work</font>

467
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:38,700
here now the transporting at vnu aljo

468
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,080
service is probably more address

469
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,730
specific so it actually makes a lot of

470
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,060
sense to move that to the algebraic in

471
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:47,880
group and that's our proposal anyway if

472
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody has comments feed break now</font>

473
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,250
would be the time to to to speak up I

474
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:56,399
guess yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess i'll throw in my two</font>

475
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:59,340
cents in I I also don't have a strong

476
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling but it seems like most of it is</font>

477
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,149
much more Alto specific now so it seems

478
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,340
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense and push it</font>

479
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:08,490
over to the alto groups that it gets the

480
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,840
right eyes on it the objects are all

481
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,170
ready to find they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just got transport</font>

482
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,929
them hile<font color="#CCCCCC"> albert sprint I'm just wanted</font>

483
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:18,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on track</font>

484
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:21,000
with it moving a bit over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alto we</font>

485
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,610
actually at sprint implemented the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sei</font>

486
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,870
map in the process in April took about

487
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:30,060
four days or so doing well in terms of

488
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,179
the design and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else working</font>

489
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:35,690
with a few partners we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't go you know</font>

490
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,850
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't go into detail who they are but</font>

491
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:42,360
at this point it is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much inside the</font>

492
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:45,120
altar server and any issues we have or

493
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,129
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tow at this point yeah</font>

494
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,100
that's this good feedback in it's good

495
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> someone's implementing it</font>

496
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,439
yeah thanks so actually yeah it's really

497
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">great to hear that somebody's</font>

498
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,650
implementing it but actually thanks also

499
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,260
you're basically confirming what we just

500
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,580
said that the split of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the what</font>

501
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,400
we actually doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty much the</font>

502
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,169
core JSON object the CD and I specific

503
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,900
and we had these discussions here you

504
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,310
presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> several times and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

505
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,990
actually in the semantics documents

506
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,520
that's in the arts editor<font color="#CCCCCC"> queue and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

507
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,410
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing now is more a new I'll to</font>

508
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,270
service and that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> also specific</font>

509
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,500
stuff in a sense yeah so you're

510
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,900
basically yeah you're saying the same

511
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:23,010
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks so can you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just repeat your</font>

512
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:27,260
name and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get it light birds from</font>

513
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:32,400
sprint<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you I can write you</font>

515
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,320
guess I we're presenting this year for

516
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group if anybody has</font>

517
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,850
objections but we're hearing more

518
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,840
confirmation so um yeah I guess I have

519
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,990
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more to say</font>

520
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,780
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way forward um you know</font>

525
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,030
objecting to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> merging the two</font>

526
00:27:54,870 --> 00:28:06,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">documents so that's probably yeah okay</font>

00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:08,879
thank you sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> you up next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font>

528

<font color="#CCCCCC">I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have one issue though so in the</font>

529
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">CD and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fci</font>

530
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,990
specification is a chartered working

531
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,940
group item so charter milestone we split

532
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,290
it now into one thing that is done and

533
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">we try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move the other one into the</font>

534
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,560
algebra so I'm discussing with Mia that

535
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,970
if it moves to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outer working route</font>

536
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,580
needs to be a mais from there as well

537
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:44,660
yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's a that's basically</font>

538
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:49,139
what we're discussing is yeah ray so the

539
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:52,680
in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the redirection</font>

540
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:56,910
Ross version 18 it's currently can you

541
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,260
connect I page it's firmly under<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

542
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,820
been in the review i think for quite

543
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:04,140
some time when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i arrived it's been to</font>

544
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:06,899
meetings we have won a major thing left

545
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,340
and let's do with privacy I'm as you

546
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,640
guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware i think we presented it</font>

547
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:14,429
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last meeting one of the things is</font>

548
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:17,430
that what this broth actually does is it

549
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,290
specifies an interface that allows an

550
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:27,300
option CDN to tell the downstream CDN

551
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:29,490
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta a certain incoming thing from</font>

552
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,870
a client and this is IP address and

553
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,240
there and there might be someone with

554
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:34,620
some other information in there I also

555
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,360
do it was anything from Asia to the

556
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:40,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">downswing CDN and obviously this has</font>

557
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:43,860
some sort of privacy implications so

558
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:47,580
what we discussed yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Stephen</font>

559
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,959
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to the next slide Kevin we had</font>

560
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,000
a meeting with bristles and Brian

561
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,570
criminal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure where they are in</font>

562
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,220
the boom no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think so and to see</font>

563
00:29:54,570 --> 00:30:01,200
what we can do about that and I

564
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:04,830
think we all agreed that is it's not an

565
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,940
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just say in the draft you</font>

566
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,408
shouldn't send anything to the

567
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,490
downstream CDN because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold</font>

568
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:12,990
effectively mean that the doubting

569
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:17,549
Sheamus is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a good</font>

570
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:18,900
informed routing decision so what we

571
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,820
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is we need to come up with</font>

572
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:24,740
some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of text that basically says</font>

573
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:27,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only tell a b c d and</font>

574
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:33,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information they should actually</font>

575
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:35,520
need for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this specific type of request</font>

576
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:38,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">then not anything else so we had a talk</font>

577
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,900
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steven yesterday and we came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

578
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,490
with some text it's all mammalian list

579
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,840
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to if you if you want to</font>

580
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,900
check it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and included here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

581
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:52,709
slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out i think</font>

582
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:54,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a it's not that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a problem</font>

583
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think basically what it says is what</font>

584
00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:01,070
it says over here and you should only

585
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,070
send information that this young

586
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:06,120
definitely requires to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

587
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,250
redirection decision and one of the

588
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">information is we can't specify within</font>

589
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,100
the draft since it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what type</font>

590
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,830
of content<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to redirect it might</font>

591
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,570
be different if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to send a movie</font>

592
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:19,199
for example then if you have some kind

593
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">of banking application so the idea is to</font>

594
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,059
not specify their information that draft

595
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:27,030
itself but base it on some sort of out

596
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:30,240
of vent communication but what we will

597
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,799
do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft it will will sort of</font>

598
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,380
highlight some especially vulnerable

599
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:38,780
fields such as cookies that you probably

600
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:44,429
shouldn't send to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dcd and former</font>

601
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:46,260
security point of view I will stuff like

602
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:48,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the UC and should convey as much</font>

603
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:51,360
information as possible we will take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

604
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,620
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the graph completely that's it</font>

605
00:31:51,360 --> 00:32:00,840
any questions about the privacy stuff no

606
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:03,270
no then there's one what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this are the</font>

607
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,678
i-89 yes another issue there was a

608
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stephen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a fair</font>

609
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,940
point basically what we have currently

610
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:09,840
in the draft is we have certification

611
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,169
objects

612
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:17,240
in which we include certain header

613
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:19,470
fields from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS Jordan children</font>

614
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,340
fields from dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll send them in</font>

615
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:25,770
the request to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DC DM but we didn't</font>

616
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,418
include there yet was any kind of

617
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,580
recommendations on how you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font>

618
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:34,159
with weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> character so characters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

619
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,389
are not in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oski set so what we'll do</font>

620
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,220
we'll add some recommendations on how to

621
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:43,289
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it and most likely what will</font>

622
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:47,840
go for is that will uses a label thing

623
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:54,049
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just a ski</font>

624
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:56,309
representation of any unicode characters

625
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:57,990
to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know the exact</font>

626
00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:00,629
details about this so if any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

627
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:14,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">have comments about this probably refer</font>

628
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:14,539
to the list here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah which is</font>

629
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:20,730
exactly there was one comment on the

630
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,409
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing from somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on monster</font>

631
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,690
would was who said it you what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

632
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:26,970
do is you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you label</font>

633
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:29,669
first because<font color="#CCCCCC"> injection you can transfer</font>

634
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:31,380
that sort of characters but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

635
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:33,149
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the point there I mean you</font>

636
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:38,390
might as well you see a level it's a

637
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:40,529
label in a posterior yeah so yeah ill

638
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:43,799
transmodulator display this information

639
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:46,070
to users please no more compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with</font>

640
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:49,049
you label cells where the appointment

641
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:52,710
yes the walls are on Dana phone so okay

642
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:55,710
in that case that's it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adobe</font>

643
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:58,049
redirection good so<font color="#E5E5E5"> dearly is to fix</font>

644
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:00,630
this once we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stevens approval I will</font>

645
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:02,429
all forget that in a few days then we'll

646
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:09,060
add a trough and<font color="#E5E5E5"> run away follow disco</font>

647
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:12,210
scared so this was originally a de

648
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,980
sponsored by Barry which voted yes on

649
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:17,099
the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the document</font>

650
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,580
doesn't have any yes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistically I</font>

651
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,200
have to review it

652
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,569
the tracker says yes right or is this

653
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:27,790
yes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sort of expired as far as</font>

654
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:33,750
so I need to review it basically i'll

655
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:39,279
try to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to you no comments no</font>

656
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:40,659
okay then undo your<font color="#E5E5E5"> i signing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

657
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,700
right so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one second right</font>

658
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:43,750
there's a few people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that walked in and</font>

659
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:46,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think they haven't signed the blue</font>

660
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,400
sheet so if you can just circulate it

661
00:34:46,000 --> 00:35:01,990
and have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new people sign it that</font>

662
00:34:48,400 --> 00:35:03,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be good so um you're i signing</font>

663
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,890
your writing history and we're going to

664
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,509
law school<font color="#E5E5E5"> for two weeks now I think</font>

665
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:09,910
we've got some pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good comments so</font>

666
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:11,440
I'll go through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> comments and now and</font>

667
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,170
then we have a more important question

668
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,380
to ask at the end sort of an elephant in

669
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:25,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the room but we'll get to that later um</font>

670
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:27,520
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> two nevis I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't very nice we</font>

671
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,340
have two new<font color="#CCCCCC"> verses posted since Buenos</font>

672
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,259
Aires basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important</font>

673
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,970
things we addressed there were a lot of

674
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:37,090
comments from lethal and gun show based

675
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,770
on what did it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he actually</font>

676
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:40,420
implemented this thing in a party

677
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,920
traffic surfer and he had some good

678
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">recommendations on how to improve</font>

679
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,300
certain aspects on output increased

680
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:50,350
performance so we have that back in the

681
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:52,690
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the drafts and will be what we added</font>

682
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,980
in 09 was the sea and I metadata off I'd

683
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,940
registration the water in sent from

684
00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:01,210
Kevin is left to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it out again so</font>

685
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:03,610
next slide please so then met in the

686
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,620
room here kindly agreed to review the

687
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,630
document from a secure security point of

688
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:11,140
view and he had some really good

689
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:13,690
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I can present</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them here</font>

690
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,299
Matt or if you want you can get your

691
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:20,500
opinion on the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> status you're</font>

692
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:23,380
here so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the TLDR here was this is</font>

693
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:26,440
looking like it was trying to reinvent

694
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,120
am a new crypto container so there was

695
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,950
and you know it's taking a lot of the

696
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">mistakes that happen early on when you</font>

697
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:35,678
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what you're doing</font>

698
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:37,179
because this stuff is kind of hard so

699
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,160
there were things like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there</font>

700
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:40,959
was a lot of well we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just assume</font>

701
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,160
this algorithm but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a lot of</font>

702
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:44,890
places where you could assume the

703
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:49,868
algorithm there was mixing of hash types

704
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:52,118
there is some the use of a sec b is not

705
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:53,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing used to sha when we're</font>

706
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:58,059
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was things</font>

707
00:36:53,769 --> 00:37:03,698
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that so um you want me to go</font>

708
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:09,479
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a my suggestion was or right</font>

709
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:13,630
that's that was my pin I<font color="#E5E5E5"> if right okay</font>

710
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:16,359
thanks men would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

711
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:18,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">formalize your comments and send some</font>

712
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:24,429
mail to the list or that would be great

713
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:26,619
thank you so next time please Kevin so

714
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:28,449
then we have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comments from</font>

715
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:30,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">work new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blasco comments there were I</font>

716
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:32,739
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a less important for now but I</font>

717
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:38,529
will briefly go through them there was a

718
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:42,099
proposal from been basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to only</font>

719
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:45,130
make the shower 256 hashing make that

720
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:47,219
mandatory and to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy DS aid to</font>

721
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,599
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of an optional thing and</font>

722
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:51,509
there was discussion of Lisbon I think

723
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,939
we didn't receive any comments of people

724
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:57,099
who didn't agree with that so if there

725
00:37:54,939 --> 00:38:01,328
are let us<font color="#CCCCCC"> know or else we'll probably</font>

726
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:02,619
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it optional then what we had is if</font>

727
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:04,299
you read in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft will have to</font>

728
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:07,599
information elements we have a key ID

729
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:10,329
and we have a key ID num and it was

730
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:16,089
introduced some time ago to increase

731
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:19,329
performance any case where use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Justin</font>

732
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:21,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">in Turkey ID but given that we now use</font>

733
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:24,789
this mandatory packaging of the

734
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:26,799
information elements there's less need

735
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:28,929
to have that so there was a proposal

736
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:30,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">from Kevin to sort of mursi's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to back</font>

737
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:32,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">together and just have one string bass</font>

738
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:35,920
key ID where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can put in a number i</font>

739
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:37,329
can put in anything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want um and</font>

740
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,549
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this very</font>

741
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:42,009
controversial topics our nobody see

742
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:44,439
which we can sort of do that the same is

743
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:45,730
true for the merging of the hf and<font color="#CCCCCC"> DJ</font>

744
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:49,390
fields there are two fields that are

745
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:52,150
used to sort of signal the algorithm

746
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's being used whether ccd is a shout</font>

747
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:57,460
256 or whatever we can leave two fields

748
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:00,399
depending on where you use a symmetric

749
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:03,520
algorithm or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a symmetric</font>

750
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,990
algorithm we might as well merge those

751
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,690
two into a single information element

752
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would also solve one issue that</font>

753
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,040
met race was that is not always clear

754
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">which other el cajon is being used since</font>

755
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,270
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of have a default algorithm as</font>

756
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,130
it is right now ready to put solve that

757
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:20,560
issue as well and the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes for the</font>

758
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,670
md and<font color="#E5E5E5"> es fields are just two</font>

759
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,680
alternatives depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which</font>

760
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,240
algorithm you used when you become aight

761
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,118
we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well merge them have a</font>

762
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,270
single information element which would

763
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:33,460
reduce the namespace a little bit then

764
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:37,750
the most important<font color="#CCCCCC"> question that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

765
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:39,250
to discuss today<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide is as</font>

766
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,800
you've seen met said we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

767
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,780
security issues and we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

768
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussion the past few days of what to</font>

769
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:48,970
do it is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can either try to solve them</font>

770
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:51,910
in the current broth which will require

771
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:53,560
somewhere but i think is doable another

772
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,020
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will suggest it i think one</font>

773
00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:00,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">from our fill originally was to</font>

774
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:02,380
basically adult Jason web token thing so

775
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:04,180
what it would do then that case is we

776
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">will sort of realized the draft as it is</font>

777
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:10,960
but base the container completely only

778
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:12,340
JSON web token thing and the benefit

779
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,970
that we would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we would</font>

780
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:19,480
basically gain the security reviews that

781
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:22,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the document already had we don't have</font>

782
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,800
to reinvent the wheel so that we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

783
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,750
speed of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security part of the</font>

784
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,369
document on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand it would</font>

785
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,260
require significant rewrite as a

786
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:30,609
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean quite now it's the</font>

787
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,050
documents quite far along or in the

788
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:33,250
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> who Glasgow but this will</font>

789
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:37,840
basically mean it we have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back a</font>

790
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:40,660
few stages and from from a serve an

00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,820
implementation perspective both<font color="#E5E5E5"> options</font>

792
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,379
have benefits on the awana round on the

793
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,180
one hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a lot of JWT</font>

794
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,850
implementations already out there you

795
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:50,319
have libraries and wrappers for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

796
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">different languages or the other end</font>

797
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,770
dear poor guys they already implemented

798
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,750
the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of the eurozone</font>

799
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,930
expect so they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go back I</font>

800
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:59,260
to death I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's anybody</font>

801
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so</font>

802
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:06,730
on the media go so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

803
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:09,060
gun<font color="#E5E5E5"> show has any opinions on this so</font>

804
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,980
basically what are your thoughts I mean

805
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:13,540
do the benefits of going for and going

806
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,650
in a new direction do they outweigh the

807
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:19,300
costs of rewriting everything what is

808
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:23,200
have a minor comment on the statement

809
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:26,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and probably delayed so it's not obvious</font>

810
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,200
to me in a sense that on some document

811
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,670
in this working group going through is g

812
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,830
review has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> the longest part of the</font>

813
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,570
processor and so you know getting the

814
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:36,549
document ready from the working group is

815
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:40,180
not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most difficult step</font>

816
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:41,860
it would suddenly arguably delay the

817
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,109
document coming out of the working group

818
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:46,360
but not obvious that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> translates</font>

819
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:50,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">into a coming out later of the whole</font>

820
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:52,900
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but so marginally you know</font>

821
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,790
myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have a strong opinion I</font>

822
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,950
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me they're both valley technical</font>

823
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:59,410
options<font color="#E5E5E5"> I even thought of you know</font>

824
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:01,480
should we do both thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

825
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:03,879
think doing doing two options is not a

826
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,410
good idea so I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know unless</font>

827
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,000
someone wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue that we should</font>

828
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:11,049
probably agree that we don't want two

829
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,090
solutions and myself one or the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

830
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:15,250
don't have a strong opinion I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

831
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:19,360
guiding principle would be you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

832
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:22,330
most expedient is my favorite option

833
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,100
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the question and the amount</font>

834
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,960
of time it would take to get the current

835
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,819
document up to a security level that

836
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,800
security guys can agree to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I</font>

837
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't Matt maybe you can give any open</font>

838
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,420
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how much effort it will be to</font>

839
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:36,460
sort of reference the same security

840
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:41,380
principles that we have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the JWT in</font>

841
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:45,010
this document as well so Matt Miller for

842
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:47,500
anybody that's so remote um so my

843
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:49,900
feeling from looking over it i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

844
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:54,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">so caveat emptor i started looking at</font>

845
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:57,430
this yesterday right so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

846
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,840
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much to from from</font>

847
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:00,609
awarding sper spective any from

848
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:05,350
implementations perspective to get to

849
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:07,410
JWT<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think you could certainly get you</font>

850
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:10,180
could probably write the text either way

851
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:12,370
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same amount of time I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

852
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,210
concerned that anything that looks like

853
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:15,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a new crypt</font>

854
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,690
container is going to it's going to

855
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:19,120
trigger a lot of flags when it gets to

856
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:22,170
sector and it gets to gen art and that's

857
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:24,520
going to delay the process significantly

858
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:26,350
whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you use something existed</font>

859
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,450
they might you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know ask one of the</font>

860
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:32,110
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work you know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did work</font>

861
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:33,129
on Jay to us and JWT and I mean and

862
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,540
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

863
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:40,240
different there so it's not going to

864
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:43,840
take variable lengthy just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to general</font>

865
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,529
command reuse of well tested vetted

866
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:50,770
components is a good thing as a you know

867
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:53,230
but obviously if you know it rolls from

868
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:56,680
limitations that sort of it's a

869
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade-off so but you know if it was</font>

870
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:03,940
entirely new think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have said you</font>

871
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:09,400
know probably use<font color="#CCCCCC"> JWT but happy to</font>

872
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:12,970
entertain a dog so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

873
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,410
answered I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say a</font>

874
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:17,980
theoretical question as to you know

875
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:20,950
would it be difficult to write it to

876
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:24,960
write a document that takes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> URI</font>

877
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,960
signing objective and put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

878
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:33,010
JWT framework now practical question is

879
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:35,980
who would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and by</font>

880
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:38,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">huayna because you know it may be all</font>

881
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:41,260
nice and well that we could do it but

882
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:46,090
the key question about going somewhere

883
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:48,640
and fastest who can do that with the

884
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:54,600
right expertise and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know he's</font>

885
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:57,490
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to commit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a volunteer</font>

886
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:01,150
volunteer I was too close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the speaker</font>

887
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">um so I definitely be willing to help</font>

888
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">write up text and work with ray and get</font>

889
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:10,600
the document more towards a JWT side

890
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,700
matt said he would help with the JWT

891
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,049
specific stuff and and he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

892
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,740
familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that out of the hose a</font>

893
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:20,080
working group and he works for blocks

894
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,240
down the street for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so i can go twist</font>

895
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,529
his arm so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to do that I'm</font>

896
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,770
willing to do the legwork on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> helped</font>

897
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:31,770
and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ray are you willing to jump on</font>

898
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:34,980
effort and okay so you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

899
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:39,210
sounds like a nap<font color="#CCCCCC"> propriate team there</font>

900
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:41,610
and now could we ask or some sort of a

901
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:43,170
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know commitment in terms of timing</font>

902
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:45,840
it's so good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a chair you know you</font>

903
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:48,840
just put action items to people<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

904
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,940
love it but something reasonable you

905
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,070
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't fix time frame</font>

906
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,560
this is gonna drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and we'll meet at</font>

907
00:45:53,070 --> 00:46:05,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next meeting or talk and we'll be at</font>

908
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:06,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same point so i mean III I don't</font>

909
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,399
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should wait for the next</font>

910
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,689
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this document I think we</font>

911
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,550
should we should have it reviewed by the

912
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:17,820
next meeting and maybe close at the next

913
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:20,070
meeting or something I guess it's you

914
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:32,280
know it's it's summer anyway so is

915
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:34,110
better yeah more experiences I can work

916
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,640
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys on the text for C&I</font>

917
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:38,850
specific tip but i agree need you help

918
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:41,910
with the you know the JWT thing so um I

919
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:43,500
mean I'm happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with saying a first</font>

920
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,330
version and maybe we can go for a month

921
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,340
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> six weeks sort of like that</font>

922
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:50,100
because I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the document</font>

923
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,450
sort of all sort of a crackhead at least

924
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,680
during the next meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

925
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,600
something considerable where is there

926
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,520
maybe we don't necessarily to go finish

927
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:02,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">it all but it's sort of relatively</font>

928
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:03,900
stable know which means when it went

929
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,509
x-ray iteration before next time years

930
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:10,140
yeah so maybe that would be beginning of

931
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:14,460
September for froyo Kevin terminus yeah

932
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:16,529
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and magic that uses you could</font>

933
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,830
rewrite the implications for Cutie's

934
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:23,430
leave us ok let's go to you yeah thanks

935
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:25,650
alright thanks to the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

936
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:30,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the significant work out of</font>

937
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:31,560
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but there anymore yeah and we</font>

938
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">are one more flight where we can</font>

939
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,040
basically say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay where you want to</font>

940
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:37,379
adopt it yes so we were to rewrite the

941
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">bus and the second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> booth here we can</font>

942
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:44,590
probably yeah for the

943
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:46,810
um just as a logistical question we end

944
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:54,820
the last call and wait and do another

945
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:56,350
one after yeah ok then we'll kill the

946
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:04,750
last call on the current version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

947
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:09,610
draft if we're going to rewrite it right

948
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:11,500
you're up again yeah yeah you're right

949
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:14,020
signing specific thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> segmented</font>

950
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:17,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">content so I've been presenting this</font>

951
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:19,030
topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings now and</font>

952
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,520
appended now we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long</font>

953
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:23,200
description about IPR before we get to

954
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,750
that let me first recap what the IDS of

955
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,549
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document basically your eyes</font>

956
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:30,400
hunting as we specified it right now in

957
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:32,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> menu rice I'm specification does not</font>

958
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,330
work for segmented content so that's HLS

959
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,380
that the sort of thing and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

960
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,819
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that you sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

961
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,420
manifest file where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

962
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:41,710
redirection form so there's no link

963
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:43,690
between the content provider in the CD

964
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,880
and what you normally have for a normal

965
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:48,850
type of content you get a manifest and

966
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,530
they get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs so what this document</font>

967
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,480
does is it Bailey is specifies an

968
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:54,850
extension for the menu right Shannon

969
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,680
document and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows for a chaining</font>

970
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:59,529
of tokens between subsequent segments

971
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:02,230
requests so that you are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if you</font>

972
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:04,090
have sort of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a certified way to</font>

973
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:07,900
get a manifest and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always get</font>

974
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:10,360
the segments as well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

975
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,580
requests be authorized by the CDN

976
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,110
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens right now where</font>

977
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,549
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the manifest is the thing that</font>

978
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:21,460
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can sort of authorized in the rest</font>

979
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:23,700
is just free fall so what we did is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

980
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,600
since the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 free version we've</font>

981
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,799
restructured<font color="#E5E5E5"> their algorithm sex</font>

982
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,600
basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do I can explain</font>

983
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we changed here but the important</font>

984
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is what was the change again I</font>

985
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:33,100
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a JSON web token thing so I</font>

986
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,710
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really makes a lot of</font>

987
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:38,650
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through the details changes</font>

988
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:41,350
here what is important<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

989
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:43,330
a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP our disclosure sort of an</font>

00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:46,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">update on the last one which is royalty</font>

991
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:48,690
free oh my hope is that this will

992
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:51,580
resolve all the IPR<font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion we've had</font>

993
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:53,080
in the past months around<font color="#CCCCCC"> this document</font>

994
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:55,480
and

995
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,270
yes I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clarify one thing on</font>

996
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:04,110
the ikea because there is a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

997
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:09,240
administrative issue in dealing with the

998
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:11,920
the IPR statements from from KP<font color="#E5E5E5"> anna and</font>

999
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,259
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been trying to basically remove</font>

1000
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,990
the old r PR statement but it still

1001
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,460
shows up so what I understand it's been

1002
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:21,459
gone since yesterday or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something so how</font>

1003
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:23,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">do people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out the IPR your or</font>

1004
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,150
whatever finally well you finally found

1005
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,310
the book or something is a very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1006
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:31,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">matching but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are clear on</font>

1007
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:31,200
that Alex<font color="#CCCCCC"> a we discussed remember we</font>

1008
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:37,060
clearly there was some kind of problem

1009
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:38,470
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your system where the mill whatever</font>

1010
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,000
were the meals bounced or something I

1011
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,560
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apparently has been</font>

1012
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,990
resolved so it's now been removed from

1013
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:48,820
the from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so next step well</font>

1014
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:50,770
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to suggest was to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> double this</font>

1015
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:54,220
working to document since we've we've

1016
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:56,280
got the IPR issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> results of course it's</font>

1017
00:50:54,220 --> 00:51:00,250
document will have to be reached within

1018
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:04,090
alongside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the main your eyes on</font>

1019
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:05,590
expect the web token thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I leave it</font>

1020
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:09,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">up to the chairs to decide what the one</font>

1021
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:11,260
here I guess the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other option that's not</font>

1022
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:13,060
listed here is originally this was part

1023
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:16,210
of the working group document we split

1024
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:21,549
it out there is an option of merging it

1025
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:23,410
back in is as opposed to as opposed to

1026
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:28,930
adopting a second document that's just

1027
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:31,330
going to rev it because the way it's the

1028
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">way it's written right way it's written</font>

1029
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:38,830
right now is raised draft creates a v2

1030
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,300
essentially of you are i signing and do

1031
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,700
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adopt a second draft that's</font>

1032
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:45,100
going to create a v2 if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're oh what is</font>

1033
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,210
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that indicates where if you</font>

1034
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:49,360
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drafts in a way it's written</font>

1035
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:51,640
right now you either use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chain</font>

1036
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,930
thing or use the non chain thing it

1037
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,310
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense to use the chain</font>

1038
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:56,319
thing in a case where you're not going

1039
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:59,680
to have segmented<font color="#E5E5E5"> content so they are</font>

1040
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,820
mutually no matter of yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't use</font>

1041
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,990
them at the same time I guess right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1042
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still a reason to usually</font>

1043
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:06,939
one even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've already you implement</font>

1044
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:10,660
v2 if you go over to Jason

1045
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:12,609
web token thing I'll have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1046
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:16,000
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this still makes sense or if it's</font>

1047
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:17,650
more of a thing where you can use where

1048
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,829
you basically the same algorithm is used

1049
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:22,869
to generate the segment to generate the

1050
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:24,640
token the only thing that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1051
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:27,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">different between the main version and</font>

1052
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,490
and editor streaming version is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

1053
00:52:27,339 --> 00:52:33,520
you transport it in the main you are

1054
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:35,078
signing spec you transported a sort of

1055
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,640
any query string within the editor

1056
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:38,230
streaming cases that that's not possible

1057
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,810
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in cookie for</font>

1058
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:44,589
example that part will still be

1059
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:46,480
different right bits on the to use case

1060
00:52:44,589 --> 00:52:48,578
but Billy algorithm is the same so we

1061
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,410
can merge that bag back in right could

1062
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:51,460
you just offer two different your

1063
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:55,899
transports are multiple different

1064
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:58,560
transport I think weekend yeah but I

1065
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:00,730
mean it's kind of a moot point whether

1066
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,380
we bring it back into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing</font>

1067
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:05,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group document since we're going</font>

1068
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:08,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to likely replace it by another document</font>

1069
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:11,799
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the question is when you guys</font>

1070
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:15,848
work on the JWT version of your i

1071
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:21,220
signing should you include that right at

1072
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:25,750
the same level so and to me one question

1073
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:27,759
that impacts on that is you know does it

1074
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:29,619
make the work a lot more complicated a

1075
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,890
lot more unstable or do you feel it's

1076
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:35,349
you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level of stability</font>

1077
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:36,940
what you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do and is it a</font>

1078
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:40,540
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more work what do you think about</font>

1079
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:42,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to me is it's just another way of</font>

1080
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,960
transporting the thing and it will

1081
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:45,368
probably be its<font color="#E5E5E5"> own section so whether</font>

1082
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,869
we place that section in the main spec

1083
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:49,150
or why we split it out into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a separate</font>

1084
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:50,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">Specter doesn't make that much of a</font>

1085
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:53,109
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll think we just have to</font>

1086
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,240
see and let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if you can we</font>

1087
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:56,890
can move in the same document and if its

1088
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,589
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> point we figure that well maybe this</font>

1089
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:02,319
is delaying the thing or making more

1090
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:05,230
complicated as it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be then we</font>

1091
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:08,200
can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good line you will</font>

1092
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:09,849
do an update of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current yeah yeah so</font>

1093
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to you know make</font>

1094
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:15,099
any formal decision at this stage since

1095
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:17,140
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next version will be a of</font>

1096
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:19,690
the jet ability solution will be an

1097
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:22,359
individual's draft yeah

1098
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:24,190
we decided right i mean we can do

1099
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,450
anything we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it as a sort of a</font>

1100
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:29,290
new individual document or we can just

1101
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:30,640
post it as it then version them of the

1102
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:32,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">menu like anything I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

1103
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,390
necessarily to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Macon because a lot of</font>

1104
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:37,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">texts will be the same the entire you</font>

1105
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:39,609
know the introduction the use cases the

1106
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:42,160
information as much little will be the

1107
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:46,089
same it'll mostly be the sort of

1108
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:48,399
algorithm which will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> different but I</font>

1109
00:54:46,089 --> 00:54:52,060
expect the first would say eight or nine

1110
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:59,050
pages to be the same as well the last

1111
00:54:52,060 --> 00:55:02,500
few sections as well do you have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

1112
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:03,849
I tend to agree that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could you can</font>

1113
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,770
get away with keeping all the

1114
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:07,960
introductory text around why we do you

1115
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:11,349
are i signing and what it's for and the

1116
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,089
center part with all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten steps for</font>

1117
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:19,599
how to generate the token is what really

1118
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:21,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs to change you know to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me you know</font>

1119
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,599
having something accepted as a working

1120
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:24,849
of document means that the working group

1121
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:26,470
is comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the you know the key</font>

1122
00:55:24,849 --> 00:55:28,510
a sense of the solution that's proposed

1123
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:30,730
so the fact that you keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 10</font>

1124
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:32,740
introductory pages you know doesn't

1125
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,970
doesn't mean much in terms of whether it

1126
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,129
should be a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group document or</font>

1127
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:39,430
not like you know it sounds like it's a

1128
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:42,310
I mean it's a change of fundamental

1129
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:48,730
technical solution no it's all it's only

1130
00:55:42,310 --> 00:56:03,940
the weights querida I don't any uh Alex

1131
00:55:48,730 --> 00:56:07,180
said you have an opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> or yeah so then</font>

1132
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:10,900
you know just for expediency then maybe

1133
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:13,240
you know we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reuse the current</font>

1134
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:17,200
working group document container and

1135
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:20,259
just change it to that and then I mean

1136
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:22,839
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone objects were given that</font>

1137
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:24,910
the IPR issue is resolved the objective

1138
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:28,420
would be to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the segmented</font>

1139
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:31,390
contact back in at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and you</font>

1140
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,049
know we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a document which has</font>

1141
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:36,038
that as well

1142
00:56:32,049 --> 00:56:37,449
and I assume we're gonna send an email

1143
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:41,109
to the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make sure that no one</font>

1144
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:43,569
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has any issue with us yes yes all</font>

1145
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:47,348
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the co workers that are on the rise</font>

1149
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:55,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">direction otherwise we can go with a</font>

1150
00:56:52,749 --> 00:56:57,459
different draft sir<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah man and on that</font>

1151
00:56:55,390 --> 00:57:00,519
I think you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know contact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1152
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:02,739

1153
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:04,988
he wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be on the new effort or not</font>

1154
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:10,719
as a call I think I'm lucky the writing

1155
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:32,170
to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks was that last night</font>

um Frederick hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> show so today</font>

1157
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:43,329
will present you the draft on<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock for</font>

1158
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:48,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">CDN I I will not dig into all the detail</font>

1159
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:52,269
of the draft due to the the decision of

1160
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:56,439
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lab of two not to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create the working</font>

1161
00:57:52,269 --> 00:58:02,589
group the working group but i will

1162
00:57:56,439 --> 00:58:07,439
present the basic ideas of this draft so

1163
00:58:02,589 --> 00:58:09,969
one of the main motivation that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1164
00:58:07,439 --> 00:58:14,739
one of the main feedback from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> logged</font>

1165
00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:17,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">off was that was that the csps and the</font>

1166
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:20,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">hidden provider are reluctant to share</font>

1167
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:27,279
their private private keys because of

1168
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:31,900
many reasons the yellow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> security so</font>

1169
00:58:27,279 --> 00:58:36,999
this draft was providing a solution to

1170
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:42,729
delegate<font color="#CCCCCC"> https content delivery from UCD</font>

1171
00:58:36,999 --> 00:58:45,600
n2d<font color="#E5E5E5"> CDN and while avoiding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the exchange</font>

1172
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:49,660
of these parties

1173
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:56,710
so we propose this draft in response to

1174
00:58:49,660 --> 00:59:03,310
that and so you can give in this we

1175
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:06,430
provided<font color="#E5E5E5"> a level architecture that is</font>

1176
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:10,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically if I'm work with a new</font>

1177
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:18,460
interface between you cdna DoD CDN and

1178
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:24,460
some slight changes in the in the CDN I

1179
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:27,430
interfaces so this interface this

1180
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:33,370
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> this lock interface but anyway</font>

1181
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:37,750
it can be other kind of interfaces with

1182
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:41,410
ro u CDN<font color="#CCCCCC"> our decision to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> request to you</font>

1183
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:47,710
CDN for credentials or for home let's

1184
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:53,049
say maybe some short short left keys for

1185
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:57,910
example instance here we have two

1186
00:59:53,050 --> 01:00:00,850
possibilities either way we can provide

1187
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:04,240
the credential while establishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1188
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:09,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">cheerless connection meaning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

1189
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:13,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UA will request the dcen for for</font>

1190
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:17,760
virtualization and during that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we</font>

1191
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:21,850
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will require you CDN that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost</font>

1192
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:25,000
the certificate yes here's a certificate

1193
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:28,420
but it can also relate those the request

1194
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,960
through an origin origin server the

1195
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:39,420
other way is also to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> shortly</font>

1196
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:45,210
kiss for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance and before any art LS</font>

1197
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:49,510
LS connections it's gone so we have

1198
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:54,280
basically true we had to use cases that

1199
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:56,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">i already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presented the last time the</font>

1200
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,900
first one is origin certificate under

1201
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:03,250
the ucen authority

1202
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:08,260
so here the decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> will request</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1203
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:11,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you CDN and the second one is basically</font>

1204
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:14,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roach in 30 58 and also party</font>

1205
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:18,819
authority so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1206
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:25,349
cascaded request to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary</font>

1207
01:01:18,819 --> 01:01:30,220
credentials to twist a visualization so

1208
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:34,589
as a conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and next step we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can say</font>

1209
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:38,410
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> lucky server will not be specified</font>

1210
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:41,589
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we may think of other</font>

1211
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:47,109
approaches that can that will be

1212
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:50,049
discussed at the ITF to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provision find</font>

1213
01:01:47,109 --> 01:01:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sansa doc certificates meaning the</font>

1214
01:01:50,049 --> 01:01:54,970
short-lived the certificate instead of

1215
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:59,920
the of the credential also<font color="#CCCCCC"> keen</font>

1216
01:01:54,970 --> 01:02:02,649
information so took to question for the

1217
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,109
for the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group look so could</font>

1218
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:07,930
those approaches be considered by the

1219
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:11,980
CDN or cdna working group in a further

1220
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:19,690
walk and do we do we all get updated rat

1221
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:21,940
with those approaches I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that you</font>

1222
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:24,880
know we we've said that we are

1223
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:28,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in figuring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out a way to do</font>

1224
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:30,369
delegation with HTTPS but that this

1225
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:34,180
working group is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be the one</font>

1226
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:36,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> should decide how that should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1227
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:38,558
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cryptographically secure way</font>

1228
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:40,539
sharing keys or sharing certs or getting

1229
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:46,630
short-lived starts or what have you

1230
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:52,200
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but maybe just some impacts</font>

1231
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:55,710
on the cdna interfaces and we began<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1232
01:02:52,200 --> 01:03:00,430
let's say studies those requirements and

1233
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:01,860
maybe those requirements could be could

1234
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:07,109
be

1235
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:10,170
I don't know my battle<font color="#E5E5E5"> photowalk I think</font>

1236
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:11,940
that if um if we had a concrete solution

1237
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:14,370
for how to do it then yeah we could

1238
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,020
probably define but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't it's not</font>

1239
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:18,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me after sitting through the</font>

1240
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:22,740
lirc bought that of the disparate

1241
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:24,990
methods proposed we could concretely

1242
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:28,500
come up with what CD and I would have to

1243
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:29,700
do it generically right each one of

1244
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,390
those methods would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1245
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:35,810
specific in terms of metadata or how we

1246
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:38,580
have to configure things right I'm

1247
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:42,200
unless other people have an opinion that

1248
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:44,580
was just my take on the Lark versus

1249
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,919
short-lived certs they would be very

1250
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:50,250
different solutions and impacts ed and I

1251
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:53,460
in different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to</font>

1252
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:55,650
see how we could I certainly if they

1253
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:57,330
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a method we would we would</font>

1254
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:59,670
be happy to look at it but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

1255
01:03:57,330 --> 01:04:04,290
how we wouldn't specify it ahead of time

1256
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:07,980
so maybe we maybe we have to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

1257
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:12,660
letter maybe your acne are also working

1258
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:17,070
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with us which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a topic</font>

1259
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:22,080
song if you have a proposal with how to

1260
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:27,960
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Acme to do this but Emil</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

1261
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:30,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mike do you want Mike</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hello telling</font>

1262
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:33,080
you what I heard is that the Acme

1263

short-term certificate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scope of</font>

1267
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:58,830
the work third and so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss</font>

1268
01:04:55,350 --> 01:05:02,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">with Acme working group if you have a</font>

1269
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:04,140
solid or agreement here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I would</font>

1270
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,850
be interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in knowing if folks in the</font>

1271
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:09,210
working group think that the short-term

1272
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:12,330
certificate is a viable solution for

1273
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:15,450
this given some of I know there were

1274
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:17,970
questions raised in the lirc<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boff about</font>

1275
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:24,029
that does to certificate revocation and

1276
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:28,230
I no fracking and I don't there was some

1277
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:30,270
type of logging issue that blows up so

1278
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:31,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest issues that came out this is</font>

1279
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:33,990
matt miller again the biggest issues

1280
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:36,690
that came up with short-term suits are

1281
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:38,520
with revocation well you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1282
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:39,630
worry about revocation because the cert

1283
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:43,950
doesn't live long enough for you to

1284
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:46,020
actually get a revoke through as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1285
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:49,169
certificate transparency in and the CT

1286
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:52,680
logs it can make them bigger but you

1287
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:54,750
know if you can't handle a very large I

1288
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,549
mean as a large CT change could happen

1289
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:59,040
whether the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether a short-term sorts</font>

1290
01:05:56,550 --> 01:06:00,270
or not and I mean cas are going to have

1291
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:05,130
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to deal with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it one way or</font>

1292
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:06,660
the other so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it then comes down to if</font>

1293
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:08,970

1323
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:52,950
stage it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like this solution</font>

1324
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:55,680
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not suitable for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CDN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I might be</font>

1325
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:58,799
suitable good candidate so we are

1326
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:00,390
encouraging people from this season our

1329
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,930
of solution and and document that into a

01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:09,920
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be submitted into the</font>

01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:12,240
Acme working group for them to consider

1332
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:15,930
everybody agrees on that's what we said

1333
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:18,000
and that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> one yeah this is</font>

saying I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the motet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

1337
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:27,689
said that approximately September

1338
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:30,990
timeframe is when they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking</font>

1339
01:08:27,689 --> 01:08:33,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">to reach order so timeline wise you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1340
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:39,210
you have through September to do that

1341
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:40,950
now it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommended to to Iran</font>

1342
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:43,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">sheffer who actually wrote the</font>

1343
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:47,189
short-term certificate draft to take it

1344
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:48,720
to the Acme working group so my

1345
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:51,929
suggestion would be that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should you</font>

1346
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:53,910
know sync up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iran and see if he</font>

1347
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:55,740
indeed plans to submit the draft into

1348
01:08:53,910 --> 01:09:00,029
acme or not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would that would be</font>

1349
01:08:55,740 --> 01:09:03,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and work with him on on</font>

1350
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:05,519
you know going over the this the short

1351
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:07,139
certificate you know and how that might

1352
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be changed I don't know</font>

1353
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:12,480
for the CD and I specific in a scenario

1354
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:16,080
so work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and if he if he's</font>

1355
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:18,029
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the work then he could</font>

1356
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,479
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that draft into the Acme working</font>

1357
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:24,120
group when it recharges in September and

1358
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:25,500
then I think we can look back<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

1359
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:29,330
see you know whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that fits</font>

1360
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:29,330
into the cdna working group

1361
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:37,939
ok so that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a progress then so</font>

1362
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:51,019
then yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably want to look and</font>

1363
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:56,780
make sure if that bright bright<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alexei</font>

1364
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:59,180
Oh Phil Phil<font color="#CCCCCC"> Swarbrick sorry i just</font>

1365
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,889
wanted to also mention another option

1366
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:04,340
that we didn't bring up Martin Thompson

1367
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:13,670
has a secure delegation thing that he

1368
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:18,320
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah yeah another option was</font>

1369
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:22,489
as a few said that we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a blank</font>

1370
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:26,570
cash options provided by a Martin

1371
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:30,290
Thompson maybe it could I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1372
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:36,710
maybe could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good candidate for a</font>

1373
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:40,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">GPS delegation I don't know um I don't</font>

1374
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:42,650
know either i said i have read the

1375
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:46,250
drafted it's certainly possible um we

1376
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:48,620
would you be willing to I I guess

1377
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:51,890
there's two there's two things here one

1378
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:54,110
is summarizing approaches and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1379
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:56,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">not there's value in doing that and the</font>

1380
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:59,989
other is if we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that acne is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

1381
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:02,150
approach at least submitting a draft

1382
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:03,830
over there with our use case so that

1383
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:12,199
they're aware of it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

1384
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:15,680
consideration yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok meal so are you</font>

1385
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:17,360
speaking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two works 12 for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acne</font>

1386
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,739
working group on another for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> city</font>

1387
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:22,969
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I would do list as it</font>

1388
01:11:18,739 --> 01:11:25,400
approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean just 225 I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1389
01:11:22,969 --> 01:11:28,880
if there's if there's value in<font color="#E5E5E5"> enlisting</font>

1390
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:32,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the approaches less but there may be</font>

1391
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:34,010
I'm open to it I don't Martin approach

1392
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:38,989
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> banking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is you quite France for</font>

1393
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:42,230
visit right yes are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to put that</font>

1394
01:11:38,989 --> 01:11:44,690
in the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's a good</font>

1395
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:46,309
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the group dude do we want a</font>

1396
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:48,580
document that looks at different

1397
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:50,720
approaches

1398
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:55,180
so how stable are these approaches

1399
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we you know we kind of a</font>

1400
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:59,810
tracking a very fast moving target here

1401
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:01,430
we you know we looked at one approach

1402
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:03,170
and we said all look is coming will

1403
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:04,730
follow look and now there's something

1404
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:06,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">else you knocked me and we said let's go</font>

1405
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:09,129
on that and then you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

1406
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:11,360
thing coming up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll follow so I</font>

1407
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:14,060
mean one thing that's clear to me is

1408
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:16,460
that there's limited expertise in in

1409
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:19,160
this group about what's the right

1410
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:21,710
security solution at high level you know

1411
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:24,530
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can work on looking at a</font>

1412
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:26,390
solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's good idea for proof</font>

1413
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:29,389
solution and trying to adapt it or maybe

1414
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:32,180
feed our requirements into it if it's an

1415
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:33,500
early solution but selecting what's the

1416
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:36,920
right approach at this stage to me in

1417
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:38,920
that working group is a very scary

1418
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,540
proposition I think it's difficult so

1419
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:43,130
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would be tempted to if the</font>

1420
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:44,510
solutions are not stable that would be

1421
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:47,570
too tempted to say well why don't we

1422
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:50,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">just pause a little bit i mean and when</font>

1423
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:51,259
there is a sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stable solution for</font>

1424
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,230
something that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font>

1425
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:55,760
addressing most of the problem we can

1426
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:58,429
you know resume the work now in the

1427
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,350
meantime there i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's good</font>

1428
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:02,360
individual things that can be done by

1429
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:04,190
individuals like you know if some of you

1430
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:06,679
are following the acne work work and

1431
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:10,250
attack me you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this short-term</font>

1432
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:13,430
certificate is a good possible candidate

1433
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:17,090
then feeding our requirements into that

1434
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:19,490
is a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right if you guys are</font>

1435
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:21,190
willing to track the current work you

1436
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:23,599
know right a little document which says

1437
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:25,820
these are the two or three possible

1438
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:29,150
solutions that could be used for CD and

1439
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:31,219
I and these are the well their status in

1440
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:33,440
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTF</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and these are the major pros and</font>

1441
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:35,510
cons at this stage I think it's useful

1442
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,759
work I mean we you know it would have

1443
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:39,650
that working group keep tabs on what

1444
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,690
happens but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we can make</font>

1445
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:44,120
any hard decision about that it's just a

1446
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:46,009
useful background work for us to track

1447
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:50,360
and decide when we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font>

1448
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:53,690
else is just my view<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a</font>

1449
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:55,969
fundamental<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do we accept for will</font>

1450
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:59,030
we accept to change the requirement if

1451
01:13:55,970 --> 01:14:00,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATF provide your solution is that</font>

1452
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:05,870
other match

1453
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:08,750
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> current requirements I think you're</font>

1454
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:10,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking whether or maybe I think you you</font>

1455
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:13,460
get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a comment which is that we</font>

1456
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:16,519
cannot just wait without doing anything

1457
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:18,710
because now may be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to feed</font>

1458
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:21,500
our requirements so ugly you know this

1459
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:24,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what I try to capture by saying those</font>

1460
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:26,750
would be more individual initiatives you

1461
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,600
know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to acme</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think we</font>

1462
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:30,860
can say sit in our working group

1463
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:33,920
believes that this is the right solution

1464
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:37,580
for us therefore we would like you to do

1465
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,320
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right do we go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like me</font>

1466
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:41,540
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want a solution that</font>

1467
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:45,259
doesn't require any change in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

1469

saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know who is we and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

1470
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:52,280
saying i don't think you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font>

1471
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:55,429
and say we the city now working group

1472
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:57,889
know that you're working on the right

1473
01:14:55,430 --> 01:15:00,350
solution for us therefore we request

1474
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:03,590
that you do this and you do that I think

1475
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:05,630
as a meal you can go there and say the

1476
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:07,970
Cena working<font color="#CCCCCC"> group needs a solution this</font>

1477
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:10,100
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good solution if you want to</font>

1478
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:11,660
address that solution with well the

1479
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:13,160
season are working group problem with

1480
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:19,130
your solution then you would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1481
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:21,860
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is how to go to this</font>

1482
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:26,090
walking robot speaking about the CDN

1483
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:27,799
reference we without the Hat it's not

1484
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:31,700
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say I'm a meal I know</font>

1485
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:34,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything I mean so I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just stated my</font>

1486
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:36,769
my opinion now you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1487
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:40,880
people here you know Kevin and not like

1488
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:43,310
say I guess I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we as a</font>

1489
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:48,470
working group have a full list of

1490
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:50,120
requirements right we as to what we want

1491
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:53,390
the solution to look like we don't have

1492
01:15:50,120 --> 01:16:00,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">a document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that says CD and I requires</font>

1493
01:15:53,390 --> 01:16:02,240
that the solution we do we have an RFC

1494
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:03,740
that has requirements but it doesn't

1495
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,050
specify how whether or not you're

1496
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:12,500
allowed to change the user agent to do

1497
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:14,890
ssl does it it's using sorry or TLS

1498
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,890
sorry

1499
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:24,810
what any i meani mean I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1500
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:27,840
pragmatic I think your concern is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1501
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:29,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">you maybe you seem to think that the</font>

1502
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">shortwave certificate is a good</font>

1503
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:37,110
potential solution I mean you know what

1504
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:40,200
why don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there and maybe I think</font>

1505
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:42,059
if you were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to articulate the</font>

1506
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:44,130
relationship between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CNI working</font>

1507
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:46,920
group and their work you know at in

1508
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:49,770
saying this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> city and our needs</font>

1509
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:52,980
and maybe your solution could fit he

1510
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:56,790
roughly that way so it's a potential use

1511
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:58,290
case for the acne new work item I think

1512
01:16:56,790 --> 01:17:00,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be receptive to that and if</font>

1513
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:03,080
you say we would have such and such

1514
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:05,490
requirements they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to that</font>

1515
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:07,680
so I would encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do that but</font>

1516
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:09,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think we can come up and say you</font>

1517
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:11,940
know the working<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CD networking group</font>

1518
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:13,830
has decided that this is the right

1519
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:21,530
solution therefore you must do this for

1520
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:21,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">us that's what I feel remember not</font>

1521
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:27,390
thanks so one thing so if you guys are

1522
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:29,460
going to require changes to user agents

1523
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:32,400
that's not an ACME thing that's a TLS

1524
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:33,630
thing because that's negotiation there

1525
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,900
me if you're going to require new bits

1526
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:39,930
in the Tila in what goes into a pickax

1527
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:41,519
certificate you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to get</font>

1528
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:43,230
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that they may at that point</font>

1529
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,190
its user agent that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's TLS</font>

1530
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:46,349
client you're going to need to make sure

1531
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:51,089
to let you know we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got TLS on board</font>

1532
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:53,490
for that if it's how the certificate

1533
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:56,150
gets issued that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that could</font>

1534
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:56,150
go through acne

1535
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:21,929
oh so this is sanjay mishra again so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1536
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:26,430
think what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would suggest is to have a</font>

1537
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:30,540
conversation again with iran and maybe

1538
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:32,070
that what he has could meet the

1539
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:34,920
requirements of what you know you're

1540
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:36,990
trying to achieve here by the https

1541
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:41,480
delegation and may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not require any</font>

1542
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:44,790
changes on the client and focus on on a

1543
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:47,750
certificate that can we delegate it from

1544
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:53,070
the upstream CDN to the downstream CDN

1545
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:56,040
and obviously some conversation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> lean</font>

1546
01:18:53,070 --> 01:19:00,269
is needed there to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into more details</font>

1547
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:01,320
and see that would actually work and you

1548
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:02,970
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be something directly</font>

1549
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,559
that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with your on and he</font>

1550
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:09,480
can take that into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Acme working</font>

1551
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:12,330
group that may be the quickest path the

1552
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:13,559
as matt said the TLS you know if there's

1553
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:15,330
a change that's required on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1554
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:19,260
client side then you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

1555
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:23,700
much you no longer time time horizon as

1556
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:25,590
well as you know willingness to wanting

1557
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:36,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the work of what you actually are</font>

1558
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:41,610
trying to do so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you encourage them</font>

1559
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:45,420
let's say studying in a high level

1560
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:50,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">review both approach but both approaches</font>

1561
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:53,490
like your blank ashes and short lead

1562
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:55,980
certificates that would be my suggestion

1563
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:58,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that would be a me but you don't</font>

1564
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:00,299
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that in a you know very deep</font>

1565
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:03,810
details it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be moving much</font>

1566
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:06,450
faster than then you know we we can

1567
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:08,460
follow so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a way to keep track</font>

1568
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:10,679
on the relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> IGF work that's</font>

1569
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:12,750
happening around us and how we could use

1570
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:16,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be useful and in</font>

1571
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:18,720
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use</font>

1572
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:20,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that document and fit it into the acne</font>

1573
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,350
working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say you know listen</font>

1574
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,770
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our you know maybe one document</font>

1575
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:25,320
where you

1576
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:27,360
you you explain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CD and I problem</font>

1577
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,889
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to solve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you said</font>

1578
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:31,200
we've identified this piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

1579
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:33,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea that piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work this is how each</font>

1580
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:35,480
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them could be used it is what we</font>

1581
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:38,730
understand eyes good and bad about it

1582
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:40,440
just for information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you were to</font>

1583
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:41,879
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could also identify the</font>

1584
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:43,559
missing if you have specific

1585
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,640
requirements from this solution you

1586
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,350
could say what we think the solution

1587
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:48,570
doesn't do that that would be a

1588
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:50,340
limitation for us it's another way of

1589
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:52,740
you know feeding requirements

1590
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:54,120
effectively and then you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1591
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:56,160
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single document and you can</font>

1592
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:58,290
contact the Acme guys to present it

1593
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,970
there as well you could present it in

1594
01:20:58,290 --> 01:21:15,870
multiple places much for working rooms

1595
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:19,620
understood thank you Frank<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">anything specific to a day on that</font>

1599
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:30,630
anyone has a comment Aleksei and what we

<font color="#E5E5E5">going things you happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pide</font>

1601
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:44,610
or um I was just recently reviewing how

1602
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:47,719
much time I spent on different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

1603
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:54,120
while doing my area director's job and

1604
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:56,760
yeah so I was telling people that I

1605
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:59,400
probably spent you know quarter to one

1606
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:02,190
third of the time on<font color="#CCCCCC"> CD and I but it was</font>

1607
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:05,580
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good reason I think we got three</font>

1608
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:07,500
or four documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roy SG so I was</font>

1609
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:11,040
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really impressed how quickly</font>

1610
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:12,630
editors and chairs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shepherds reply</font>

1611
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:15,360
to all the comments and how quickly

1612
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:17,370
comments were dealt with so thank you

1613
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:23,219
for that I think we're right well done

1614
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:25,710
collectively thank you ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font>

1615
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:29,100
can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> close the meeting on that very</font>

1616
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:34,650
positive notes<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright goodbye everyone</font>

1617
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:35,820
thank you sorry I guess maybe 11 think

1618
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:39,540
evan is

1619
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:42,389
um about next meeting you know then

1620
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:44,010
there's a lot of a agenda items that

1621
01:22:42,389 --> 01:22:48,119
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just follow the edge and I things</font>

1622
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:50,010
go well right and but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should still</font>

1623
01:22:48,119 --> 01:22:53,848
have a physical meeting right and the

1624
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">next 90 f do people feel do people feel</font>

1625
01:22:53,849 --> 01:22:59,550
like we need at this point we're

1626
01:22:56,730 --> 01:23:01,440
assuming footprint and capabilities will

1627
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:03,179
fall off the agenda metadata will fall

1628
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,400
off the agenda request routing will fall

1629
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:08,960
off the agenda all right you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are i</font>

1630
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:11,909
signing will still be on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda</font>

1631
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:15,540
hoping we get at least one rewrite in

1632
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:18,480
between and I I do think it's it's

1633
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:19,889
useful to keep talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS even</font>

1634
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:22,110
though the solution keeps changing on

1635
01:23:19,889 --> 01:23:23,900
Frederick every single meeting he gets

1636
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:27,750
to have a new draft every single meeting

1637
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:32,759
but do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think that we need a meeting</font>

1638
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:33,989
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> URI signing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in HTTPS is that or is</font>

1639
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:40,050
that something we can take care of on

1640
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:43,619
the link right if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> i signees</font>

1641
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:48,060
going well yeah then we may not need

1642
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:58,139
another face to face you particularly

1643
01:23:48,060 --> 01:24:07,050
phrase not there right yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could</font>

1644
01:23:58,139 --> 01:24:10,079
also arrange no no it would be basically

1645
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:18,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">two into topics to documents yeah maybe</font>

1646
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:23,369
rate pacing you Fermat wakes up said

1647
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:26,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay with the ad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we'll see we'll</font>

1648
01:24:23,369 --> 01:24:27,960
see where we are and decide when the

1649
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:31,829
deadline comes around whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not we</font>

1650
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:35,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">need a face-to-face all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right all right</font>

1651
01:24:31,829 --> 01:24:35,150
goodbye everyone thanks everybody

1652
01:24:43,850 --> 01:25:29,190
what's you yes no problems or just one

1653
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:31,490
make sure that we remember that she was

1654
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:31,490
the night
