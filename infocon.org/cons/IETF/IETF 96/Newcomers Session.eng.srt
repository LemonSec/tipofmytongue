00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,120
dubious honor of attending more of these

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,060
this up mainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

30
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">be seeing this in every single session</font>

31
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,220
you sit in<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to read</font>

32
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,020
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now it's available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and you</font>

33
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,910
can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there the note well is</font>

34
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,190
basically telling you that when you're

35
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,720
here you're pretty much in public and

36
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:46,180
what you're talking about here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

37
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,110
contribution of the IETF so be aware of

38
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,190
what you're talking about when you're

39
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,900
talking about it if you've got things

40
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,550
that are company confidential go

41
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,429
someplace else and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them</font>

42
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,650
they're not in not in the open sessions

43
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:04,220
so just read this later on it's a useful

44
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:06,560
thing to know about this session is all

45
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,340
about giving you information that is

46
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately useful to you in this</font>

47
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,320
meeting um it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the history of the</font>

48
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,510
IHF there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places to get that</font>

49
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,980
or you can buy one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old guys a</font>

50
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,719
beer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you what you want to</font>

51
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:26,650
know it is also not how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write an RC</font>

52
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,640
or a standard again other places to go

53
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,590
throughout the entire presentation

54
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,900
you're going to be seeing QR codes um

55
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,789
this is something trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

56
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,530
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not we'll make any sense if</font>

57
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,240
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the audience you can</font>

58
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:41,689
take a picture of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and get right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

59
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,390
the link or its scannable from your from

60
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,950
your paper copy as well so in this

61
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,900
particular case this goes to the RFC

62
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,930
editor website

63
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,630
it may or may not be useful for you one

64
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,250
of the things for new attendees is you

65
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes get overwhelmed with</font>

66

everything that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on part of this</font>

78
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,630

<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of hint of what we'd like to</font>

announced on the mailing list or they

205
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:21,600
are announced in a working group saying

206
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,240
we're interested in thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a new</font>

corridors here you will see people

212
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:39,149
usually in a big circle or around a

213
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:41,939
table with laptops open working like

214

239
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:55,110
meeting but it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always it's</font>

240
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,420

<font color="#E5E5E5">from here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok um just for curiosity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sake</font>

244
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:08,939
how many people here have worked in a

245
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,389
standards development organizations it's

246
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:14,220
not the IETF put your hands up<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok not</font>

247
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:17,789
too bad you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to relearn</font>

248
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,839
are unlearned for us i HAF feels a

249
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:21,089
little bit different than every other

250
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,668
organization that I and I've worked I've

251
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:27,770
worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of SD does we are</font>

252
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:30,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">very informal about how things do</font>

253
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,270
individual participants you're all here

254
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,980
not as people being sent from your

255
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:38,429
company to represent<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company we</font>

256
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,500
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you as you not as your company</font>

257
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:44,130
not as your organization not as your

258
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,980
dream so if you bring the ideas here the

259
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,810
ideas we want to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> are your ideas</font>

260
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we have no formal government role</font>

261
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,760
although people keep trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

262
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:56,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen sometimes and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all about</font>

263
00:17:52,760 --> 00:18:00,900
having the best thing win in the market

264
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,879
so our standards tend to be about what

265
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:07,350
works not about what somebody wants to

266
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">sell hopefully by the time it works we</font>

267
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:13,409
want to sell it so we are all focused on

268
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,320
internet technologies we don't do

269
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,960
anything below the IP layer except for

270
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,350
small little things like mpls and we

271
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do anything above the above the</font>

272
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,340
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of we sort of reach into the</font>

273
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,350
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer a little bit so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

274
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">will hear people say yeah it's not in</font>

275
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,500
scope for us just believe it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then go</font>

276
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,700
and figure out why they said it

277
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:40,070
traditional SEOs formal voting you're

278
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,010
going to be a national member or

279
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:46,020
organizational member almost exclusively

280
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">good example I so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> international</font>

country<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we don't vote rarely</font>

283
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:58,379
individuals treaty-based sometimes the

00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,850
standards that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put together in a</font>

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,080
regular standards development

are the number of threads on a screw of

a standard for making fruitcakes you

know things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't do okay</font>

standards or development organization

299
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,389
take a breath the IETF is not them it

300
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,590
will take you it may take you a little

301
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,260
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time just to figure out what's</font>

302
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,629
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on but it's pretty straightforward</font>

303
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,150
again it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you as the</font>

304
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:54,180
contributor not about what your company

305
00:19:51,150 --> 00:20:01,780
is pushing towards us

306
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:04,060
um sorry this has happened hasn't

307
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,430
happened in a while we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very informal</font>

308
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,919
we do but we do have people here who

309
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,420
show up in ties occasionally usually

310
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,270
they stopped<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it after a while</font>

311
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:16,870
there's a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still come</font>

312
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:19,240
here and ties it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but don't be</font>

313
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:22,360
surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> if if I'm sitting up here in</font>

314
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,170
shorts and a t-shirt next time it's just

315
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:30,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way the thing is very smart group of</font>

316
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:31,840
people very opinionated it's the way it

317
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,150
is it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit like sometimes it's</font>

318
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,040
a little bit like standards by combat we

319
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,740
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and avoid those types of things but</font>

320
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,300
be aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are good technical</font>

321
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,020
people not necessarily good people

322
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:46,000
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you're in a</font>

323
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,480
conversation with somebody and they're

324
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">being very forthright about their</font>

325
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">opinions it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're trying to</font>

326
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:58,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">be rude it's this it's just this is the</font>

327
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,909
way they they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only here and</font>

328
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,530
probably back racking their and their

329
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,430
home organizations or their home

330
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:08,379
companies mostly they're not trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

331
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:11,430
be rude<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can point out the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

332
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:15,550
occasionally who are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be rude</font>

333
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:18,340
yeah they're not here hey we have a

334
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:20,020
culture occasionally people come in and

335
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,429
expect their culture to be our culture

336
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:26,560
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the case over time your impact</font>

337
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,030
on the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> will change what we</font>

338
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,030
are but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to happen</font>

339
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:32,800
overnight so be aware you may have to do

340
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,990
some adaptation as you come in and just

341
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:39,190
pay attention to the signs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and signals</font>

342
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:41,320
and learn about how we do things if you

343
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:44,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't like it feel free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

344
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,240
change now the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one down here the</font>

345
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">last comment down here dumb ideas</font>

ideas one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's happened</font>

348
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,620
from time to time especially with

349
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,270
organizations who are new to us naughty

350
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,040
not just the people the organizations

351
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,620
that are new to us they come in with a

352
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:03,190
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to vote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their idea</font>

353
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:05,590
into existence<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it doesn't work here</font>

354
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if it's a dumb idea the technical</font>

355
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are going to look at it's a dumb</font>

356
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,870
idea

357
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:13,870
this is our what this organization are

358
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:16,149
all about so when you go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

359
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,800
meetings please think about what the

360
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,770
technical argument is not what the

361
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:23,260
political or economic argument or what

362
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:26,460
your boss<font color="#E5E5E5"> tells you to tell us unless he</font>

363
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:30,340
heads good toon guardians of course so

364
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:34,420
we develop standards and that's just

365
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:38,110
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it is we're looking to make the</font>

366
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:41,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet better more useful continue on</font>

367
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:45,159
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed technologies once in a</font>

368
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:50,670
really major way ipv4 to ipv6 that was

369
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:53,410
hard we look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and the</font>

370
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,720
next thing and the next thing and try

371
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:58,960
and figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to make it work we</font>

372
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,420
also try to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that it's</font>

373
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,030
manageable that you can actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

374
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,730
out into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the field and deploy it and it</font>

375
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:10,840
actually doesn't cause your IT guy or

376
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,370
your network guy to be on the phone 24

377
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,570
hours a day<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven days a week trying to</font>

378
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,889
figure out what that little knob meant

379
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:25,780
that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you turned at the entire</font>

380
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:28,240
network crashed so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> no vote are we</font>

381
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,860
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vote but we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vote it the</font>

382
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,860
IETF believes in something called rough

383
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,809
consensus and what that means is that we

384
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,360
do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> need perfect consensus in a</font>

385
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:39,399
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go forward understands what</font>

386
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,760
we need rough consensus which means that

387
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've got a good number of the people</font>

388
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">who say this is a good idea and we've</font>

389
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:53,320
considered all the other we all are the

390
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:54,340
all the other issues all other issues

391
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,710
are addressed but they're not

392
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,959
necessarily brought into the final

393
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,780
solution if you're sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a meeting</font>

394
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,210
our working group here and you start

395
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:07,389
hearing huh me it's not incipient

396
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:11,260
feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's a way of</font>

397
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:13,420
establishing our judging consensus work

398
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:17,650
you know so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would say to</font>

399
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:19,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys okay um am I more to the left</font>

400
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,490
or the right of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the center of the room</font>

401
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,889
with the left people hum

402
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,300
and then it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be judging consensus</font>

403
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,830
and that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like right</font>

404
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,770
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle and you just sort of be</font>

405
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,850
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to guess where I was so you'll</font>

406
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:35,889
hear those hums happen from time to time

407
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:37,600
if you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

408
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,790
if you actually are familiar with the

409
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,219
clap the question feel free to join in

410
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,840
if you're not please don't it just

411
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">confuses things if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't figure out</font>

412
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,270
what goes on because the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

413
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,470
humming and how loud it is gives you an

414
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:55,260
idea of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have actually</font>

415
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,260
like paid attention to the discussion

416
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,980
most of this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty basic we want you</font>

417
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,800
to be kind to everybody else and we want

424
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:25,750
by making<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself known and by making</font>

called birds of a feather working group

instantiation of a working group that

592
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:13,649
sadly enough um generally a working

593
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:16,049
group is designed to pick a particular

594
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:18,480
problem run for a particular length of

595
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:21,260
time produce a couple of documents that

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">are described in its Charter and end</font>

597
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,140
sometimes we can't quite do that so we

598
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,168
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that last for quite a long</font>

599
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:31,500
period of time the face-to-face meeting

600
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:34,320
is all about resolving points that have

601
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,419
come up along that process that you

602
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,250
can't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need more bandwidth</font>

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,389
that will happen at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group</font>

609
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:54,178
session is that you will get

610
00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:56,158
occasional introductions of new ideas or

611
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:58,499
things that might be merged into other

612
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,419
documents so you might get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tiny little</font>

613
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:06,320
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tutorial but mostly it's going to</font>

614
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:09,749
be about what's already going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

615
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,549
occasionally it<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that the</font>

616
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">working groups just sort of got stood up</font>

617
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:16,200

618
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,149
session before we stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a working</font>

620
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:22,978
perceive the working group sometimes

621
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:24,719
they're a one-shot discussion on a topic

622
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:26,309
that we're not going we know we're not

623
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:29,579
going to go to a working group on but

624
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:33,989
mostly they're there to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

625
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:36,029
we might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on this is where</font>

626
00:33:33,989 --> 00:33:38,669
we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the pros charter the</font>

proposed work items a tutorial about the

628
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:43,859
problem so these might be a little bit

629
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:47,879
more tutorial for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

633
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,779
to form a working group if so we go

634
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,969
through the whole charging process and

635
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:59,309
it shows up as as they work boss

636
00:33:56,969 --> 00:34:00,989
generally only meet once it's really

637
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:03,749
really rare<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a ball feet twice</font>

645
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:26,189
that we've realized that we can't bring

646

00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,830
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 is that right roughly roughly</font>

709
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:14,290
and then you'll see some registration

710
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:17,670
staff who are generally locally hired to

711
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:19,770
do the meeting things um

712
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,650
great people<font color="#CCCCCC"> Secretariat website is</font>

713
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,960
there please take a look at it and again

714
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:27,420
when you see these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've got</font>

715
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have mineable work</font>

716
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">out usually there are the people that</font>

717
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:35,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go to and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last resort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

718
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:37,140
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to hopefully point you in</font>

719
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,450
the right direction internet assigned

720
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,368
names and numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> Authority um if you</font>

721
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,319
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on an internet draft and you</font>

722
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:46,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making changes to the</font>

723
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:49,259
parameter registry and mostly how many

724
00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">people understood that statement that's</font>

725
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,530
what I was afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when you get</font>

726
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,819
further into the IETF as you build

727
00:37:54,530 --> 00:38:01,369
documents one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will do</font>

728
00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:03,869
is assign numbers the things that you

729
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:05,790
reference like an internet internet

730
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:07,079
address refers to a particular house so

731
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,970
domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> name and things like that</font>

732
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:16,020
parameters registry is more along the

733
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:18,359
lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm blanking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

734
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here parameter register use is more</font>

735
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:26,098
along the lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what that bit met in</font>

736
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,150
that packet at position 23<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so when</font>

737
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,970
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to it you mount your</font>

738
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:32,579
going to want to talk to these folks on

739
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:33,899
Michelle's back there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are</font>

740
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:36,780
probably others scattered throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

741
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,200
whole thing rse editor when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets time</font>

742
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,579
to turn the internet drafts which is our

743
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,319
which is the process which is the first

744
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,510
document you will ever see in this

745
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:47,880
organization into something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

746
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:50,790
refer to as a standard we turn them into

747
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,040
rfcs which stands for a really strange

748
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,529
name request for comments the reason the

749
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,250
stands for that is historical<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there</font>

750
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:01,230
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an RFC editor staff and RC editor</font>

751
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:03,480
series editor production<font color="#E5E5E5"> center</font>

752
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:05,819
publisher and there's also a guy who

753
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,849
isn't actually part of the staff but is

754
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:10,529
responsible for managing a series of rcs

755
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:12,900
that are independently submitted as

756
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:18,450
opposed to submitted through the IETF

757
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:20,849
process this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why I said purple these</font>

758
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:24,270
are good<font color="#CCCCCC"> people um say hi to him thank</font>

759
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:27,780
him please uh you'll see ray wandering

760
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:31,109
around ray is a is an employee of the

761
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:35,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet Society and his job is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

762
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:37,529
manage the contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Secretariat</font>

763
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:40,410
and folks along those lines he he

764
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:41,849
basically is the guy responsible for

765
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,379
putting his name on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature that</font>

766
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:47,759
gets us to various hotels and things

767
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:50,549
like that I Anna staff the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IANA staff</font>

768
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:53,910
and the RFC people will have tables out

769
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:55,829
by the registration desk um they

770
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">generally have office hours the first</font>

771
00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:01,890
three days of the meeting go<font color="#CCCCCC"> have fun</font>

772
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:04,819
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him they have candy so you know</font>

773
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:08,819
go by and say hi it's a useful thing

774
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:11,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and we finally come to slide 19 how</font>

775
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:14,730
am i doing a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I mean well um</font>

776
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,950
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said that I wasn't going to</font>

777
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:19,289
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF organizations such</font>

778
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:21,359
go read this this talks about the

779
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:24,539
history in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF it talks about how</font>

780
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:28,739
we're organized how we select on how we

781
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:31,289
select some of our our management it's a

782
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:34,230
good document um although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

783
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:36,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably time we updated it the meeting</font>

784
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,849
wiki there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these for every</font>

785
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:41,308
meeting so this I ETF 96 will change

786
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:42,869
after every meeting but in for this

787
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:46,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting this is the place you want to go</font>

788
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:47,910
most effectively useful if you're

789
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:49,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for something to take you to</font>

790
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,940
ride with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> airport or come back</font>

791
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,558
or come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the airport when you're</font>

792
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,079
getting here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's other things</font>

793
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there like the networking</font>

794
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,150
information stuff um tutorials there's a

795
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of information that has been put</font>

796
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,289
together about how the IETF works and

797
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,839
about how to do things like right graphs

798
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:09,710
and such the tutorials directory has a

799
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:14,190
bunch of that please<font color="#E5E5E5"> go take a look</font>

800
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:15,809
there is a I think it's like five five

801
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:19,400
or six mailing lists that come up for

802
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:21,119
every meeting and there is a meeting

803
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,619
there's a meaningless that you're

804
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">subscribed to regard whether you want to</font>

805
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,700
or not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't meeting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> announcements</font>

806
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:29,220
there's a meaningless that there's a

807
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,950
male eNOS that you are subscribed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

808
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,118
you asked for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is goes to</font>

809
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,919
anybody who's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the meetings</font>

810
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,350
there's another meaningless for

811
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:42,280
newcomers

812
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:45,190
which is right there so useful things

813
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:50,800
network information um on your printer

814
00:41:45,190 --> 00:42:01,420
slide I had a reference to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place on</font>

815
00:41:50,800 --> 00:42:04,920
the main IETF page which is sorry stop

816
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:08,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh-oh it's now up</font>

817
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you can go from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and get to</font>

818
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:19,299
there um at the time I was doing this

819
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:20,560
document it was not seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

820
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,910
hadn't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that before I actually</font>

821
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:27,190
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just go back to the</font>

822
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:28,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">page so anyway it if you want to figure</font>

823
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:32,680
out how to get on for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our network this</font>

824
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:35,110
is where you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go this is possibly</font>

825
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:38,160
the best network connectivity you will

826
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:42,340
have unless you work for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> company that</font>

827
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,440
sells it anywhere in the world we we

828
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,750
have a great staff we've been doing this

829
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,060
like I said now for well we've been

830
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:54,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing networking now for about 28 years</font>

831
00:42:49,060 --> 00:43:00,160
at the meeting so go on here it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

832
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:01,090
you get started um I RTF<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going</font>

833
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention this because you're going to</font>

834
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:06,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">see these on the agenda um I RTF</font>

835
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:08,470
internet research task force it's an

836
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:12,160
organized activity the in an

837
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:15,069
architecture board and it is a group of

838
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,560
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> a group of research groups that</font>

839
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:19,750
look at things that were not ready to

840
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,480
look at in the IETF sort of researching

841
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:24,820
things the late on our networking was

842
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,610
literally investigating interplanetary

843
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:29,230
networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay vint cerf was involved</font>

844
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:31,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">in that one by the way just kind of fun</font>

845
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:34,180
one of the ones that you will probably

846
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,800
see a lot of conversation especially if

847
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,290
you're working in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security area is</font>

848
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,380
the cryptographic the crypto research

00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:37,300
have a chat<font color="#E5E5E5"> with about what you want to</font>

that be assertive this is your

919
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:51,820
opportunity to do this I think our

920
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:54,280
current definition for newcomer is five

921
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,540

922
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,400
fewer meetings you're welcome to come to

923
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,529

924
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,900
chances after this one to beat some<font color="#E5E5E5"> feet</font>
