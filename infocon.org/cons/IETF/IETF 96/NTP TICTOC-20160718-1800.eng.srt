on the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the design team but</font>

130
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,150
the main issue that needs to be solved

131
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,580
first is um that the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to do</font>

things initially in the NTS<font color="#CCCCCC"> drafts and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

133
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,860
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still in there um with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

134

135
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,360
just wrapped into extension fields of

136
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,810
ntp<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets did not work out because um</font>

137
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,220
we needed to transport actually change

138
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,920
of

139
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">goods which was which was so large that</font>

140
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,079
that would cause IP fragmentation and

141
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,519
generally large size of the NDP packet

142
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:35,050
switches which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also generally a</font>

143
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,610
problem um yeah we would get problems

144
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,019
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT devices with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP</font>

145
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,089
fragmentation we might get the problem

146
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the resulting ntp packet would be</font>

147
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:45,009
rejected by a client<font color="#E5E5E5"> or server just</font>

148
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:47,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of its size on even after the</font>

149
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:48,910
fragmentation had been reverted and also

150
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:50,560
IP fragmentation has some negative

151
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,459
implications on the protocol security

152
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,550
and so we went ahead considering

153
00:10:54,459 --> 00:11:00,930
alternatives on the first alternative

154
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:05,410
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be to just still run the</font>

156
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,300
extension fields as originally planned

157
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:14,019
but with some mechanism to do the

158
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,628
fragmentation so that it doesn't have to

159
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:21,670
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done on an IP level um this would be</font>

160
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:23,139
tons and tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work and so we yeah are</font>

161
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:28,149
strongly considering other alternatives

162
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:31,569
um something that has also been on the

163
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:33,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">table at times was to just run the</font>

168

doesn't solve the fact that we've been

169
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:48,939
advised that IP fragmentation is bad on

170

a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> level and might also not</font>

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:57,518

extension field on regular ntp packets

183
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:28,509
and this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done over UDP 123 um</font>

184
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,569
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last alternative that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't</font>

185
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:32,480

186
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:34,069
pretty

187
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,190
over the channel that is represented by

188
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:40,040
extension fields of actual ntp packets

189
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:46,600
so this would go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a UDP 123 um</font>

190

next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> please also an issue that is</font>

191
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,120
related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this heavily is that we</font>

192
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:58,930
somehow might or might not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font>

193
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:04,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the usual ntp rate bandwidth or</font>

194
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:08,449
packet rate limitations um because on

195
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:11,589
the one hand there might be on suppliers

196
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:13,699
that just enforce these limitations on

197
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,529
levels that are not the actual ntp

198
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:18,290
software so out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control of the</font>

199
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:20,300
ntp software and also we have a

200
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,660
requirement somewhere in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nds main</font>

201
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:26,990
document that says that um<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTS secure</font>

202
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:29,480
traffic must not negatively interfere

203
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,570
with non-secured um time synchronization

204
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,470
traffic in this case ntp traffic and so

205
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:40,510
it's also debatable whether on whether

206
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:43,040
or not pushing the right limitation

207
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,199
levels with key exchange packets some

208
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,069
might fall in that category in my tent

209
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,370
enter that requirement so the

210
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:53,510
accountants are pretty much we could run

211
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,079
whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we're going to run</font>

212
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,959
over UDP 123 and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to</font>

213
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:02,560
post the question do we respect the

214
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:06,469
usual rate limitations um or do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

215
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,810
if we do not then the whole key exchange

216
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:12,260
setup it might be more might become very

217
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:15,050
slow um which is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep in</font>

218
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,600
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this would also represent kind</font>

219
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,459
of maximum compatibility and then the

220
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,069
other big option is to not run over UDP

221
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:27,138
123 and just ignore any reservations

222
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:29,880
that are usually enforced<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok next slide</font>

00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:31,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">please here we have Alice</font>

224
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,890
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that need to be decided pretty</font>

225

<font color="#E5E5E5">much no matter what k exchange mechanism</font>

226
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:43,980
we go for specifically on and the first

227
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,200
one is and we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these in the side meeting three a few</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hours ago the first one of these is what</font>

230
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,880
is to be done with unauthenticated time

231
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">stems that we might get as kind of a</font>

232
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,380
side effect of key exchange because we

233
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,530
do the key exchange mechanism over

234
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,990
actual ntp packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

235
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:08,030
week consensus that we've reached is

236
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:10,290
that it is healthy to forbid that these

237
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:15,000
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> these unauthenticated time</font>

238
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:16,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">stamps are used whereas because we have</font>

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,810
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirement that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hybrid mode must be</font>

240
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible it is probably not a good idea</font>

241
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:25,890
too hard forbid the usage of

242
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:28,589
unauthenticated time stamps overall and

243
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:32,819
then the question needs to be posed how

244
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:35,220
to handle pure mode with on the key

245
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,440
exchange model that we go for and also

246
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether to handle that at all and one</font>

247
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,370
alternative that we might go for because

248
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:45,930
we want and need to push um some version

249
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,690
of some helpful version of the document

250
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,060
out soon um<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be to postpone pure</font>

251
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:54,330
mode actually because some consensus

252
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,920
that we've reached or some result of the

253
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:59,910
discussions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've had was that pier</font>

254
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:03,930
mode isn't all that important to most of

255
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:06,569
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that use ntp and those that</font>

256
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,739
it is important to have reasons where

257
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,670
they might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> persuaded to use other</font>

258
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,940
mechanisms the same discussion pretty

259
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,860
much on is to be had about authorization

260
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,240
both server and client authorization

261
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,400
mostly kind authorization um is just a

262
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,300
is it healthy to postpone this issue and

263
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,790
um have a document out that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font>

264
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,969
with it yet and we're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of leaning</font>

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,080
the design team but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

288
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,300
much i'm falling from relevance because

289
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,570
these are only relevant if we choose to

290
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:36,180
go for the NTS custom key exchange and

291
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,330
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're leaning towards at least not</font>

292
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,470
soothing choosing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the UM</font>

293
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,320
mandatory to implement key exchange

294
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,710
algorithm these can helpfully be

295
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,610
postponed or not thought about for now

296
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay next slide please um other things</font>

297
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be done is first off the</font>

298
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,260
handling of cipher suites as it is in

299

the documents currently um is not

301
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:06,750
improved upon we have dropped from an

302
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:09,360
charm that might help with dealing with

303
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">this issue and something that has</font>

306
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> item that can</font>

be said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be checked off the list</font>

308
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:25,050
successfully is that we generalized from

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">hmx procedures which bid um chosen in</font>

310
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,780
the specification it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to</font>

311
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:34,230
do it back to Mac algorithms in general

312
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:37,530
um something else that was discussed was

313
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:40,470
where where to put and how much text to

314
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,240
put in the documents about the chicken

315

317
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,750

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,560
security mechanisms to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> reliable and</font>

319
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consensus that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hovering</font>

320
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,740
right now is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need enough text to</font>

321
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:02,950
clearly specify what NTS needs a

322
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:04,540
requirement on but the actual deeper

323
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,390
discussion on this should not be

324
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,310
anywhere in the NTS documents they might

325
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,740
it might go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into some kind of external</font>

326
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:15,730
document would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good idea to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have it</font>

327
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:18,190
somewhere um pretty much the same thing

328
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes for discussion about just a</font>

329
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:24,160
comparison between different on overall

330
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:27,610
security mechanisms like NTS or<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto key</font>

331
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,980
or the symmetric key exchange um this

332
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,199
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be healthy to have available</font>

333
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:36,160
somewhere we just feel that it doesn't

334
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:38,320
really belong in the NTS documents um

335
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,210
and then we have also one issue the

336
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,889
issue of symmetry of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> message sizes</font>

337
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,050
in the actual time synchronization

338
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,910
exchange from where it was discussed

339
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,850
whether it's it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant that</font>

340
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:52,570
on the request and response message are

341
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:56,350
of the same size just to increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

342
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:58,570
symmetry in the communication we do not

343
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,980
yet have any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of consensus on the</font>

344
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,820
site it hasn't been discussed much as

345
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:07,240
far as I remember next slide please<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

346
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,629
what's to be done next the first thing

347
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,030
in the debt is it's important that we

348
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:15,010
clarify um one key exchange mechanism

349
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,110
that is actually mandatory to implement

350
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,060
for any implementation um so that all

351
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the different potentially all the</font>

352
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,590
different implementations have something

353
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,070
that all can use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this needs to be</font>

354
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:29,980
specified<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the NTP draft um something</font>

355
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:34,780
that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> help with this is a proposal</font>

356
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:37,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">by Demi franca um whos dis driving is</font>

357
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:42,310
used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS for what we intend to do</font>

358
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:44,460
um yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a specification of</font>

359
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:49,960
how the mechanism is to be used in

360
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:52,390
specifically in the NTS for ntp draft um

361
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,670
we then need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do or</font>

362
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:59,170
if to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about the pier mode</font>

363
00:20:54,670 --> 00:21:01,690
and it to specify the question about the

364
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:05,080
unauthenticated timing information if

365
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:07,000
the question posed a pisser itself due

366
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,649
to the phase change mechanism like if we

367
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,820
have these unauthenticated timestamps

368
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,870
flying around

369
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:16,030
oh and the course of key exchange and

370
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:19,360
then we should see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we bet and how</font>

371
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:21,820
we include the work in the announcers

372
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:27,610
draft into our specification<font color="#CCCCCC"> and use</font>

373
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:30,790
this next slide please so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

374
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:34,830
much poses the question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to go</font>

375
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:38,440
about publication of the these documents

376
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:41,110
um we<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to</font>

377
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,740
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new version</font>

378
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:46,800
out for the NTS<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20p draft and we need to</font>

379
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">have another working group last call</font>

380
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,930
don't still says right after the next

381
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:57,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">face-to-face meeting karen has hinted at</font>

382
00:21:52,930 --> 00:22:00,580
but she wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to be sooner um</font>

383
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,100
one issue that we still have remaining

384
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:07,449
is that even if we postpone stuff from

385
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:10,209
the NTS<font color="#E5E5E5"> front EP draft um we also have</font>

386
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,160
the generic NTS draft and this needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

387
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,020
contain material<font color="#E5E5E5"> about at least the</font>

388
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,540
broadcast<font color="#CCCCCC"> month that's that's the issue</font>

389
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,879
specifically I feel and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if we if</font>

390
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,100
we push that out of the NTS 20p draft

391
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,440
the NTS 20p draft requires that the

392
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,760
anti-aircraft be published and so we

393
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,620
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do with it</font>

394
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we feel that in the course of the</font>

395
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,629
working group last call um while we got

396
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,310
a lot of feedback we did not get

397
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,470
concrete feedback about the quality of

398
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:40,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> specification with the broadcast</font>

399
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:42,100
mode and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it might be possibly</font>

400
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,280
have a third document the CMS for NTS

401
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,020
this is largely used for a would largely

402
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,899
be used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unaccustomed key</font>

403
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,629
exchange protocol so huge amounts of

404
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,090
what's in there are not relevant anymore

405
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:58,180
if we don't use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the mandatory</font>

406
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,520
mechanism and what is the relevant could

407
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:04,690
be just taken into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> documents</font>

408
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:08,080
so it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to to drop this</font>

409
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:12,070
or drop the publication process for this

410
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,679
document at least depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

411
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,740
choose as the key mechanism okay do we

412
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,870
have a next time no

413
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,980
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I'm open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for questions</font>

414
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:24,750
and discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so just a couple</font>

415
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,920
points<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we open the floor for</font>

416
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:33,179
general questions based on the the side

417
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:36,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting we had earlier today we sort of</font>

418
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:39,090
have a couple of of next steps and one

419
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:47,250
of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Daniel is working on a draft</font>

420
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:50,300
for us and and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have I'm</font>

421
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:54,330
assuming you know continuing calls

422
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:58,260
that's some interval figure out what it

423
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:59,879
I do for the design team itself mom and

424
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,800
I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

425
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,970
when we get to a specific scheduling but

426
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:10,550
we've also talked about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> concept of</font>

427
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:13,290
having a face-to-face interim

428
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:16,169
specifically in the probably in the

429
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,670
Boston area in either in

430

431
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:30,950
some dates out on the mailing list it to

432
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:33,120
see what what might actually work so

433
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,220
obviously we only have a one hour slot

434
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,719
now and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much how</font>

435
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:42,510
much of the detailed questions that we

436
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:48,809
want want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into a few very few but</font>

437
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:50,160
you get an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the of the the status</font>

438
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:53,970
of the work so are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions</font>

439
00:24:50,160 --> 00:25:00,900
about status or approach or anything

440
00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:02,820
like that any remote questions nope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

441
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,559
the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing that I did want to</font>

442
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,010
point out is<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the if you go</font>

443
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,629
to tools ITF torg go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTP wiki at</font>

444
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:14,250
the top of the wiki you'll see a link

445
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:16,650
for the the NTS working group last call

446
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">design team and we're doing a fairly</font>

447
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,000
decent job or they are doing a fairly

448
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,428
decent job of keeping rough summaries of

449
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,760
where they are and there's also a link

450
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:28,530
to a Google document there that has some

451
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,429
of these issues articulated a little bit

452
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">further so any</font>

453
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:35,919
the questions about that nope fabulous

454
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:38,889
the next thing on our to-do list is the

455
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:45,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">bcp and i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send dennis to the</font>

458
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:56,110

459
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:58,259
now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just go over the current</font>

460
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:01,840
status<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp document it's</font>

461
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:08,499
currently up on the data tracker as

462
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:10,949
draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> riley ntp ecp 02 that's a bit of</font>

463
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:13,059
my fault because I didn't understand how

464
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,220
items get promoted so I will be

465
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:23,320
resubmitting it sometime this week as

466
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:25,240
draft IETF ntp bcp and the draft has

467
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,700
been reviewed by a few people now it has

468
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,679
some good information in it more review

469
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,929
is always welcome so if you have the

470
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,720
time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> review it either in its current</font>

471
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:39,490
form or once it gets uploaded as an ietf

472
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,529
document if you could send<font color="#CCCCCC"> me your input</font>

473
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:44,889
either directly or on the mailing list I

474
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:47,409
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it um right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now there are a</font>

475
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:48,820
few areas other than just general

476
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:52,509
editing and making sure all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> links</font>

477
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:54,158
work there are a few areas that we're

478
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:57,669
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve before we move it</font>

479
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,529
forward one is in the security

480
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:03,129
considerations the current track has

481
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:04,779
nothing there it just has a TBD I intend

482
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:07,570
to supply something this week<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some</font>

483
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:11,230
general text about how important time is

484
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:14,019
to security to again with and then also

485
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:16,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> highlighting the parts the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vcp that</font>

486
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:19,299
deal directly with security so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

487
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:23,350
will be there in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coming week or so</font>

488
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:25,830
on we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg Dowd working on</font>

489
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:29,129
some information<font color="#CCCCCC"> for load balancing</font>

490
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:32,049
which we'd very much like to get in um

491
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:33,789
but you know it's it's still in progress

492
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:37,749
i'm sure it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very comprehensive</font>

493
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:40,840
once it gets in at the working meeting

494
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:42,759
we had earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> today we came to a</font>

495
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,549
consensus that the best path forward

496
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:47,419
would

497
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:50,809
probably be to take the document in its

498
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:54,039
current form make the modifications to

499
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:56,509
those two sections that i mentioned

500
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:59,360
clean up the rest of the test for text

501
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:02,059
for any stray links that might be might

502
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,979
be there and we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a target to</font>

503
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:09,080
consider um moving it forward on toward

504
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">workgroup last call at the next interim</font>

505
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,850
meeting which would likely be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

506
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:16,009
month um so you should expect to see

507
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:20,629
some activity on that document over the

508
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:24,499
coming weeks that's all I have right now

509
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:30,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">um if anybody has any questions just on</font>

510
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:33,980
the the general flow of things I think

511
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:37,158
that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great thank you let's go</font>

512
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,720
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slides so the next set of</font>

513
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:43,609
documents are a set that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

514
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:48,679
defer to the next virtual interim but I

515
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:51,230
did want to highlight them just a tiny

516
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:53,629
bit we have we have an ongoing

517
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,429
discussion about extension fields and we

518
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:59,899
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ongoing discussion discussion</font>

519
00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:01,639
about the ref ID documents we talked

520
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:07,719
earlier today about the distinction

521
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:09,469
between ref ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> additions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that ref ID</font>

522
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:16,519
things that are backwards compatible

523
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:20,480
versus those that are not and I think

524
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:23,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">and there was some desire to see some</font>

525
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,519
consolidation of the drafts that we have

526
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:27,889
potentially consolidated into the set

527
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,950
that are backwards compatible and the

528
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:36,229
set that are not or consolidation that

529
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:38,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">would make them make it clear which ones</font>

530
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:43,129
were backwards compatible and which ones

531
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:47,359
were not I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Harlan if there is</font>

532
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:50,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">something in particular that you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

533
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:53,529
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these I don't know if you've</font>

534
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,529
tried your microphone remotely

535
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,680
nope there he goes I just asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> him that</font>

536
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:14,649
so I could push the red button oh thank

537
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:16,940
you um<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the first I've heard of</font>

538
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,640
extension field proposals that are not

539
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:25,010
backward compatible so I don't know what

540
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means yet but i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking i was</font>

541
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:34,610
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ref ID stuff i believe</font>

542
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:36,740
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um i'm not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> word okay no i mean</font>

543
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:38,870
they're out there there's a number of

544
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,760
extension that the extension field draft

545
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:46,969
that Danny and I are working on has to

546
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:51,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">do with exact goes to some mechanism</font>

547
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:54,380
around what is a ref what is an

548
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:58,159
extension field there there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> also out</font>

549
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:00,530
there drafts on some ref ID proposals

550
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,780
and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of other extension</font>

551
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:04,430
field proposals that are out there so

552
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,260
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been up for a while I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

553
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">had much feedback on them the other</font>

554
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:14,180
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say is that i sent Brian</font>

555
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">utterback a email and I think I've sent</font>

556
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:20,480
it to Danny as well that has a 15 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font>

557
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:25,719
line hunk of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pseudo code that shows how</font>

558
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:28,850
to crack an<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTP packet that includes an</font>

559
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,570
arbitrary number of extension fields

560
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:37,070
possibly followed by a legacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac and</font>

561
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:39,379
how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use that to parse a packet</font>

562
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,629
and the you know all you need is a

563
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,640
switch that says if I've got something

564
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,640
at the end do I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parse it as a</font>

565
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,190
legacy Mac or an extension field and

566
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,220
it's just as I've said it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big</font>

567
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,220
deal

568
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let me ask a question of the</font>

569
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:05,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">room how many people have read any of</font>

570
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:09,460
these drafts hmm okay so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

571
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:15,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out how to get these reviewed and</font>

572
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:16,929
moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there anybody here or</font>

573
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:21,610
remotely that can volunteer to review

574
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:27,160
the any of the ref ID documents okay

575
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:29,050
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh good I see it and then the</font>

576
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:34,590
extension header ones these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

577
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:36,639
really short drafts actually so and as

578
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,629
part of the reviewing them you could

579
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,250
also think about how they could

580
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:44,679
potentially be condensed so and I think

581
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:51,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really important actually I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

582
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:53,860
want to I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the things that</font>

583
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need to look at is we for the people</font>

584
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are reviewing the extension field</font>

585
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:02,890
stuff we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to review the RFC that was</font>

586
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:04,630
recently done in the context of these so

587
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,190
if you have an interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

588
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular draft you might want to</font>

589
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:12,820
volunteer to review<font color="#CCCCCC"> that draft those set</font>

590
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:20,410
of drafts okay I'm trying not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

591
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:22,389
names but um so anyway uh I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

592
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:24,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see these on the table for the next</font>

593
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,830
virtual interim and see if we can get

594
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:32,830
them resolved and make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision on</font>

595
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:34,570
them one way or the other to move those

596
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:38,379
forward and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that that that set of</font>

597
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:40,300
issues addressed if not the concept of

598
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,940
doing a face-to-face interim to deal

599
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,760
specifically with MTX will probably

600
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,100
expand to deal with NTS and this this

601
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,530
set of of drafts when we get all the key

602
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:57,389
players in the same place any other

603
00:33:50,530 --> 00:34:03,059
questions or comments on this topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

604
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:09,360
so the next topic that we have is a a

605
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:09,360
document submitted on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mode 6</font>

606
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:15,130
protocols which despite your long

607
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,480
history<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF you named it in</font>

608
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:24,760
such a way it didn't show up in the

609
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:31,330
tools but before so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had asked Brian to</font>

610
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:35,590
do a a draft on the we've had for a long

611
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:37,719
time on our list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do's documenting</font>

612
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:40,540
a piece that got left out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> RSC 1305</font>

613
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:42,669
when we did the<font color="#CCCCCC"> update to ntp and it had</font>

614
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,529
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with the mode six messages we</font>

615
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:48,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually had a conversation earlier in</font>

616
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:50,730
the in our side meeting about whether it

617
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:54,370
makes sense to proceed with this or not

618
00:34:50,730 --> 00:35:03,090
and there was some feeling that it's

619
00:34:54,370 --> 00:35:03,089
basically a<font color="#E5E5E5"> management tool and that by</font>

620
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,890
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font>

621
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,630
encouraging people to use it any way we

622
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,549
want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be encouraging them to use</font>

623
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:15,910
standard management protocols instead of

624
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:20,530
using something like this and so

625
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:23,560
especially with Harlan remote and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian</font>

626
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:25,180
sitting here we can bet we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

627
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">double-check this on the mailing list</font>

628
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:31,350
but sort of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus was maybe we</font>

629
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:39,280
don't need this after all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe we</font>

630
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:41,650
would that by by publishing an RFC at

631
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,270
this point related to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular</font>

632
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,830
piece that we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be encouraging</font>

633
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:47,550
people to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we really in</font>

634
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">general don't think we want them to do</font>

635
00:35:47,550 --> 00:36:00,520
go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cal relaying Harlan he says we</font>

636
00:35:52,870 --> 00:36:01,839
need it about distressed so so Harlan

637
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,930
you say that we need it and that no

638
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:09,430
working alternatives exist can you jump

639
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:10,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">back in oh yes you're in the queue so</font>

640
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,069
you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak Harlan I haven't</font>

641
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,480
knocked you out of qu<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

642
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:21,880
that it was left out was an oversight

643
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:25,570
and that's a bug

644
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,120
and if some other alternative exists

645
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:30,880
that some other framework to implement

646
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:33,900
it that's great but let's have that

647
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">because mode</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 provides critical</font>

648
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,970
functionality and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice to</font>

649
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:44,080
have something working before we decide

650
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:49,120
to deprecate the old way um<font color="#CCCCCC"> hollander</font>

651
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:51,460
this is haiku<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I basically my opinion</font>

652
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,680
with this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have to drop</font>

653
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:58,270
it entirely but I don't see a

654
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:01,779
requirement for creating an RFC for this

655
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:04,030
basically because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are trying to</font>

656
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:08,590
standardize a management protocol for

657
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:12,610
this one single specific let's say

658
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:16,270
application space for<font color="#CCCCCC"> MTP and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in my</font>

659
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:19,410
view if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to standardize the</font>

660
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:23,470
management monitoring and configuration

00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:26,020
possibilities of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTP service instance</font>

662

we should if we really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

663
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,509
we should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with one of the</font>

existing standard protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I don't</font>

00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:38,230
want to depreciate mode six packets or

666
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:42,220
anything but I don't I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

667
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:45,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lot of it's a very high</font>

668
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:49,109
priority to standardize this way of

669
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:52,620
managing ntp server it's it's probably

670
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:55,180
the reference implementation is the only

671
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:57,759
implementation using it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine</font>

672
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:59,919
and there will always be a inclement

673
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,910
ation specific ways of monitoring and

674
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:07,720
management but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on</font>

675
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:09,430
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other working items we have on</font>

676
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,330
the agenda of this working group and

677
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:17,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">just leave that as it is and don't</font>

678
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:20,290
create an RFC out of it okay if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may if</font>

679
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,649
you want an implementation specific way

680
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:25,960
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's called mode 7</font>

681
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:28,840
mode 6 is an implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> independent</font>

682
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,620
way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> perform ntp monitoring that</font>

683
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,570
requires no additional mechanism so

684
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,470
again until there's a working

685
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,670
alternative

686
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:45,399
I'm opposed to getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of the</font>

687
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:48,130
contents of mud<font color="#E5E5E5"> six there is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

00:38:45,400 --> 00:39:02,490
here from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Daniel Frank that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making it</font>

689
00:38:48,130 --> 00:39:06,040
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll resolve the dispute so</font>

690
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:08,009
you're not going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer I'm waiting</font>

691
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:14,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">to hear what you say because well oh</font>

692
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:17,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so Brian Hammerman so first in</font>

693
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:19,000
response to what Harlan said it wasn't

694
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,700
an oversight we actually made a

695
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,720
conscious decision to leave him out I

696
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,640
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it but</font>

697
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,990
there are probably good ones um but I

698
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,759
actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond probably</font>

699
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:33,640
somewhat to the question the towel<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

700
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:38,230
read um relayed but also what<font color="#CCCCCC"> heiko just</font>

701
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:42,089
said so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know where to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

702
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:45,040
about six commands because 5905 actually

703
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:46,779
obsoletes 1305 which which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where they</font>

704
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,770
were defined so people don't think to go

705
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:53,470
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look so there's a couple of</font>

706
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:55,030
options one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you just said</font>

707
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:59,589
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just let people try and find him if</font>

708
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,609
they really really want them which I you

709
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:04,029
know if the work group wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

710
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:05,560
then why we could go the router just

711
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,300
publishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> an informational RFC that</font>

712
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:11,380
says here's what the reference

713
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:15,760
deployment ation does and we're done or

714
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:17,589
if you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be correct in the</font>

715
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">status of this in order to have to</font>

716
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:22,390
represent what what you just said we

717
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:28,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">publish the RFC but we publish it</font>

718
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:30,368
immediately as historic yeah and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

719
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,020
basically says yes this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what people</font>

720
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:36,099
have done but we don't recommend doing

721
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:40,450
it going forward yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't</font>

722
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:42,520
think that documenting a certain

723
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,480
specific let's say feature or

724
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,880
functionality often implementation is

725
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:52,110
subject to an RFC I mean I

726
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:56,050
would see that an RFC is basically

727
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:58,750
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to standardize oh the way how</font>

728
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,790
other implementations and all

729
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,340
implementations basically who are who

730
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">claim to be our c compliant should deal</font>

731
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:10,330
with that and my point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

732
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:13,209
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a historic thing so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i I'm</font>

733
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:16,180
probably in favor of either publishing

734
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:19,080
it as an informational RFC as an

735
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:22,270
historic RFC if you want or just

736
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:24,520
document it on the ntb<font color="#CCCCCC"> doc website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

737
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:26,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say this is how it how</font>

738
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,540
it currently works if anybody's

739
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:30,040
interested in it this for me this is

740
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,770
part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> documentation of the</font>

741
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:37,210
reference implementation and not subject

742
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:38,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">to an RC and in general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree with</font>

743
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">your initial premise that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

744
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:42,060
there's really no reason to publish

745
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:47,290
something that's implementation-specific

746
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:50,080
however because 1305 does document ntp

747
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:51,700
and includes the mode six people are

748
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:56,610
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look for it in some some</font>

749
00:41:51,700 --> 00:42:01,569
fashion so yeah it from my perspective

750
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:02,650
it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if the working</font>

751
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,960
group wants to do one way or the other

752
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:08,980
I'm perfectly fine with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

753
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,140
no skin off of my back I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out</font>

754
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:14,460
if I may that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the reasons they</font>

755
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:18,580
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 is to allow monitoring of</font>

756
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:20,680
ntp and by built keeping it as part of

757
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:24,160
the protocol it's a very lightweight

758
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:27,279
mechanism that can be very useful while

759
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,370
the system is coming up or in the face

760
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,570
of other issues if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

761
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,690
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you this</font>

762
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:37,390
mechanism unless you know in order to

763
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:41,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide monitoring of ntp you're going</font>

764
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:44,440
to uses other mechanism you're adding

765
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:46,420
complexity to the system even during

766
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,920
times of<font color="#CCCCCC"> startup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that is</font>

767
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">short-sighted so Harlan I'll just say</font>

768
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,880
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know completely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in jest you have</font>

769
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,880
problems with SNMP

770
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:08,730
go ahead suresh krisshnan<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I I kind of</font>

771
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,650
disagree with like<font color="#CCCCCC"> huggers</font>

772
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,850
characterization of this like I think

773
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,360
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to publish something is</font>

774
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:16,950
historic right leg<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if so if it's</font>

775
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,360
just one implementation probably not but

776
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,980
if it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one like it probably</font>

777
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,570
makes sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> just document like what's in</font>

778
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,940
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like Brian said it's like</font>

779
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:25,890
something that was taken off right and

780
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,170
if it causes confusion like for somebody

781
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:31,950
looking like it's same thing happened in

782
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:35,670
v6 right like we took out<font color="#E5E5E5"> em and like</font>

783
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:37,169
obits from the specification and it kept

784
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,340
coming up for like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years people say</font>

785
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,800
like what do they mean what do they mean

786
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,270
and we still haven't put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back but</font>

787
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,620
people just say like oh the previous

788
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">version had it this version doesn't so</font>

789
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,730
and so if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> question goes away if</font>

790
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,500
people are actually asking the question

791
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,390
then it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to publish like even</font>

792
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:59,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">ss-sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you don't have a problem</font>

793
00:43:51,390 --> 00:44:01,410
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us publishing it as historic ok so</font>

794
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:04,230
there's another comment from Daniel

795
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:06,660
Frank not all RFC's our standards and

796
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,000
then he adds having something out there

797
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,399
to explain how to interoperate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

798
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">reference implementation is a good thing</font>

799
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:20,210
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it isn't a recommendation or</font>

800
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:20,210
standard and his battery's gonna die

801
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:28,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay um go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead I shall sorry just to</font>

802
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:33,240
add<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the security point of view I</font>

803
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:37,470
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommend documenting all these</font>

804
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:40,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">mod six information because um we find</font>

805
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:42,870
out that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several probably</font>

806
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,850
firewalls who are dropping some of the

807
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:47,930
mod six mode 7 queries from security

808
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:51,000
point of perspective but since all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

809
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:53,430
mood<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 queries are not documented they</font>

810
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,560
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know which ones exist and</font>

811
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:59,640
we have actually found a file found out

812
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:02,070
so many mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> six queries which make your</font>

813
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,200
clients vulnerable to Billy unnecessary

814
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,780
information and then that could be

815
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,279
exploited so it's important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have them</font>

816
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,900
documented somewhere because people

817
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,390
don't know and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not able to</font>

818
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,130
brilliant<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you would go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us</font>

819
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:17,259
documenting and then recommending not

820
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:20,799
use them<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless you absolutely have to I</font>

821
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:23,140
couldn't find I we found out some

822
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:26,589
queries that I'm not documented anywhere

823
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:29,618
but they do exist and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem I</font>

824
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:31,900
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you and Joe sort of</font>

825
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:33,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">Schengen and so yeah so if you go for</font>

826
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,740
historic like so what I heard is like

827
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:38,200
Angeles on the contribute text to the

828
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:45,759
security considerations to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brian go</font>

829
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:48,279
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so Brian so I hear</font>

830
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,670
consensus oh go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob I wouldn't</font>

831
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:54,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to deny you your mic time Rob</font>

832
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:56,770
Maggie<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep dive networking just after a</font>

833
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:58,150
quick sidebar it does seem like with the

834
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:00,940
consensus of making the recommendation

835
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:02,680
that we don't suggest you use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all</font>

836
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:06,220
those reasons that that would fit nicely

837
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:08,319
and bcp if we're going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> best a</font>

838
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,879
best practices document we're

839
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,920
recommending<font color="#E5E5E5"> in best practice so maybe</font>

840
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,720
we could move that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to there and then</font>

841
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,210
make the decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> about whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

842
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,180
documented as historic or not for the

843
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:21,250
just that subject but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should maybe be</font>

844
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:24,578
added to be CP because it certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

845
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:27,910
recommendation we should decide if we

846
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:35,349
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so you're saying maintain</font>

847
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:37,180
a separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the recommendation</font>

848
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:39,099
should not be in the core documents what

849
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,549
you're saying go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> may I jump in for</font>

850
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:45,910
a moment when it's convenient go ahead

851
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:49,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh what you're advocating here is losing</font>

852
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:52,480
the ability to type ntp Q Dash P and see

853
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,779
what the status is of your of the NT<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,270
the MTP instance on your machine or and

855
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:59,380
you're not working here yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

856
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,880
people here with their thumbs up

857
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:05,920
thinking that's actually a good thing to

858
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,390
lose so I that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whoa wait wait wait</font>

859
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,440
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> umm</font>

860
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:13,960
so so Harlan just just to clarify if we

861
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,839
document this is historic it doesn't

862
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:20,380
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't use it it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just means</font>

863
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:21,730
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't recommend you using it but</font>

864
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,140
that doesn't mean we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna we're not</font>

865
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:24,580
going to send the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTP protocol police</font>

866
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,790
out because Karen's got too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

867
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:30,279
do anyways again I'll feel a whole lot

868
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:32,950
better about these things when there is

869
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:40,240
a known working implementation of

870
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:42,370
something to replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so well actly</font>

871
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:45,819
yeah so we have 12 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> left so I</font>

872
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:47,220
should probably but you're new to the

873
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:51,910
mic so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a word</font>

874
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:54,310
Sebastian figa and yeah I think running

875
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:57,910
mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> six over the network is a different</font>

876
00:47:54,310 --> 00:48:00,759
thing than running NT PQ on your machine

877
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:04,720
and for running it on your machine it

878
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:06,190
doesn't need to be in the stand up yeah

879
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,669
that's that's an interesting point

880
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:12,550
actually thank you um so yeah ask me a

881
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:14,800
question I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna ask you a question</font>

882
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:19,210
yes you looked right<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me and said</font>

883
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:24,310
let's ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian oh that was at least a</font>

884
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:25,930
minute ago so um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brian I like then it</font>

885
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,130
sounds to me like there's there's rough

886
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:31,089
consensus to move forward with this

887
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:33,820
document as we've discussed can you so

888
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,860
first of all I need the Harlin's since

889
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,660
you are one of the strong proponents of

890
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:42,010
having this documented<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to be</font>

891
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:44,140
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NT f folks definitely</font>

892
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:49,120
review what's there and make sure that

893
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:52,960
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good document i will and i</font>

894
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:54,490
will send a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question about adopting the</font>

895
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,780
document as a working your document to

896
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:59,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mailing list and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then Brian will</font>

897
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:04,240
submit it with the right name<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with</font>

898
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:09,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that yep thank you Brian</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so back to</font>

899
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,209

900
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:15,040
next slide and so we're going to move

901
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:16,330
quickly through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh so as I said</font>

902
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,070
we're talking about doing some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

903
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:21,310
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntp face-to-face interim in the</font>

904
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:22,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Boston area primarily focused on NTS but</font>

905
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:29,230
also looking to resolve some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

906
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:31,779
other issues and I have some some some

907
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:35,320
rough schedule stuff going forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

908
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:37,570
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave Christoph to continue to</font>

909
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,130
you can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the schedule for the</font>

910
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,509
NTS

911
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:42,599
working group last call<font color="#E5E5E5"> design team</font>

912
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:44,880
meetings going forward so so that's

913
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:48,029
we're not going to discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> that here we</font>

914
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,849
will have probably three interims

915
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:52,529
between now and soul i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

916
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:57,180
looking at the week<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and i'll send</font>

917
00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">out the dates out to get some rough</font>

918
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,359
feedback on them but we're looking at

919
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:03,950
something the week<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> august 22nd or</font>

920
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:07,319
29th and then September 12th or 19th

921
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:09,269
October 10th or 17 so there's some you

922
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:10,410
know rough weeks there I'll send that

923
00:50:09,269 --> 00:50:13,529
out on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing list to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

924
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:15,538
feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at turning</font>

925
00:50:13,529 --> 00:50:17,400
one of those virtuals into a potential

926
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:20,220
full day<font color="#E5E5E5"> face-to-face in the Boston area</font>

927
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,640
either the September set or the October

928
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:27,689
set and we'll work on the details of how

929
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:31,109
to do that later then obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HAF 97</font>

930
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:35,279
is the week of<font color="#CCCCCC"> november 14th</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think if</font>

931
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:40,500
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some basic choices i think with</font>

932
00:50:35,279 --> 00:50:42,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Daniel's you know with Daniels input</font>

933
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,710
that's coming I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

934
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:49,799
chance to move to working group last

935
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:51,599
call prior to ITF 97 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christophe is</font>

936
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:54,420
looking very skeptical every time I say

937
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,720
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have objectives you</font>

938
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:02,730
have to have goals so at that point that

939
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:07,410
brings us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ntp items so</font>

940
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:09,509
go to the to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to</font>

941
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:16,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">move on to tik tok with nine minutes</font>

942
00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:20,549
left read Daniels comment on here first

943
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:22,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so Daniel hopes to have a his NTS</font>

944
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:24,990
proposal done in about three weeks which

945
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:26,789
is which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good so that'll be in</font>

946
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:29,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">advance of our next virtual interim</font>

947
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:36,059
which would be great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea alright so for</font>

948
00:51:29,759 --> 00:51:39,180

<font color="#E5E5E5">sure again relaying Daniel my goal by</font>

950
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:44,190
the way is to have a relatively complete

951
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:48,289
first draft of my NTS proposal in about

952
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:48,289
three weeks thank you

953
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:57,920

954
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:07,070
I'm going to step through is where we

955

<font color="#CCCCCC">are with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tick-tock the actually go to</font>

957
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,900
this and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure why I put them in</font>

958
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:14,680
this order so to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

959
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:17,750
specific working group items in Tik Tok

00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,299
the myth has completed IETF last call we

961

were just talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

962
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,920
expecting a final update from the

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,500
authors dealing with a few remaining

964
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,330
issues and then we have the resolution

965
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,640
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I Triple E copyright question</font>

966
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:33,290
that's on the table we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have two</font>

967
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,430
documents that have completed working

editor update and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1588 over</font>

976
00:52:53,210 --> 00:53:01,099

that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't received that yet so</font>

979
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:05,839
at some point we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide whether</font>

980
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:08,450
we're going to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward or that with</font>

981
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:14,810
that or not then if you move back<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

982
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:16,460
slide so that brings us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the other two</font>

983
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:19,940
items<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are on the plate right now</font>

00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:24,290
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> tick-tock and one is the yang data</font>

986
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:28,279
that one we also need a little bit of

987
00:53:25,609 --> 00:53:29,960
feedback from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I Triple E I ATF</font>

988
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,109
Coordination Committee it's a slightly

989
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:35,119
different issue in a sense that we're

990
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:37,670
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get we want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

993
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:45,770
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting all of the i's dotted and</font>

994
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:47,510
t's crossed so that we know before we

995
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:49,820
proceed with publishing it here that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

996
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:53,119
will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transfer it there part</font>

997
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:56,920
of the issue here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that I Triple E 802</font>

998
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:59,030
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hf have long figured out how to</font>

999
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,490
mostly collaborate with each other

1000
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:04,610
productively but I

1001
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:07,819
1588 is not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> triply 802 and so</font>

1002
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:10,760
sometimes that makes just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tiny bit</font>

1003
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,110
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated so that item is on the</font>

1004
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,580
table and then the last thing that's on

1005
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:15,290
the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we really haven't done</font>

1006
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:18,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">much with is the scalable</font>

1007
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:24,470
synchronization networks and I don't see

1008
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:25,850
those oh there they are so there is

1009
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1010
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,670
do with the scalable synchronization

1011
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:33,880
work we did spin up a separate mailing

1012
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:33,880
list for that there hasn't been a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1013
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:40,640
activity and so we need to figure out

1014
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:44,300
what we wanted what we want to do with

1015
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:48,440
those drafts eventually so that brings

1016
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:51,050
me I believe go down a slide and then

1017
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,820
down another slide so I've already

1018
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:53,930
really talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about next steps which are</font>

1019
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,880
the interim meetings that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1020
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:57,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">have going forward so this brings me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1021
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:03,980
the end of all of our business for the

1022
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:06,100
ntp and tik-tok working groups the so we

1023
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:09,440
will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short meeting on Friday</font>

1024
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,520
based on I mean check check your email

1025
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,680
to make sure it doesn't actually get

1026
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">cancelled because the primary work out</font>

1027
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,940
of that will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do we do based on</font>

1028
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:20,900
the feedback we got from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I Triple E</font>

1029
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:28,270
IETF coordination committee so any

1030
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:28,270
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comments at the end of this</font>

1031
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:38,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok oh there's Suresh yeah so one thing I</font>

1032
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:40,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like some kind of rough</font>

1033
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:43,250
timeline on when this next steps would

1034
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:45,350
happen so like for the merger of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1035
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:48,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">group's so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Allen kind of tentative</font>

1036
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:51,259
timeline would be nice like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

1037
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:53,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">arrive at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it like soon yeah actually I I</font>

1038
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:55,400
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have cut that part out when I</font>

1039
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:58,040
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying attention there there is</font>

1040
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">still a plan to merge the two working</font>

1041
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,480
groups at one<font color="#CCCCCC"> point I thought perhaps</font>

1042
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:05,540
the tick-tock work was dying down and we

1043
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,490
would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> close it and use ntp only but</font>

1044
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:11,150
further conversation has led us to

1045
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:13,459
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we there's still</font>

1046
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:15,260
enough that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep a working</font>

1047
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:18,500
group for time related items in

1048
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:20,300
the ITF so i think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path we're</font>

1049
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:25,910
going to do is the time related items

1050
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:27,590
and a time a timeline for that hmm just

1051
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:30,500
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to acknowledge but I wanted</font>

1052
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">like probably / I was gonna say did</font>
