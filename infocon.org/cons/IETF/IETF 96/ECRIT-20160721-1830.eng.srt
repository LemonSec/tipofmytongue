00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,920
you wouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDP and set up a</font>

148
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:47,260
session with with with media so the

149
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,760
example here is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> alarm right an alarm</font>

150
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,110
goes off you send<font color="#CCCCCC"> the message it's got</font>

151
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,569
all the same data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be an</font>

152
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,590
invite gets routed like a any other

153
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,990
emergency calls

154
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,870
you're in service SOS<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the and the</font>

155
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">request-uri and are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out that you get</font>

156
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,200
from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost server and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a route</font>

157
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:07,680
header and it does exactly the same

158
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,680
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it doesn't set up a media um</font>

159
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:16,050
there's a request to deal with a

160
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:19,089
statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> about privacy mainly that</font>

161
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,880
privacy for emergency calls and that

162
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,350
would apply to data only emergency calls

163
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,020
is subject to local regulation and

164
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're in many jurisdictions there are</font>

165
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:33,730
regulations that basically reveal or

166
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,470
tell you that that certain information

167
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,180
that normally is considered private is

168
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,010
at least shared with emergency services

169
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,329
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is actually a meaningful</font>

170
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,790
statement you need to make sure that

171
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:46,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's in the concern in the</font>

172
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,790
consideration so I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in um there</font>

173
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,800
was reference to a draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I put in</font>

174
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,360
that lets you do an update to additional

175
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,400
data we haven't worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that draft for</font>

176
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,900
a while and I decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

177
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,060
out that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the easiest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to</font>

178
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,939
progress this document eventually want

179
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get back to that because some data</font>

180
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,960
and specifically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that you're</font>

181
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:09,100
using a message alarm data would be the

182
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,450
example may in fact change over time we

183
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,490
have another way to do it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can send</font>

184
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,800
it by reference and then repeatedly

185
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,170
dereference it so we have a mechanism to

186
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,849
to do that but a push mechanism is

187
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,709
probably better but I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

188
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,060
reference it I don't need we don't need

189
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:27,160
that mechanism to make this useful and

190
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,510
tying the to the dress together is

191
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,260
probably not a good idea so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just took</font>

192
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:35,280
it out just deleted the text and then I

193
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:38,230
needed to make changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to conform to the</font>

194
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,560
the syntax that we have in the final

195
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,740
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of additional data i was using</font>

196
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,510
some earlier syntax and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i fix those</font>

197
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,450
those are the changes we did do a

198
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,060
working loose last call on but there

199
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:55,090
there was not a really a large amount of

200
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,979
review um and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make changes so</font>

201
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,270
the chairs agreed well the chairs

202
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,110
decided that they would just rerun

203
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:03,850
another last call which is fine and and

204
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,730
that's what we that's what they did so

205
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,240
we we would appreciate a few reviews i'm

206
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,550
going to get the

207
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:14,200
guys to refute to to do some reviews

208
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,420
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to deploy this in the nena</font>

209
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,330
architecture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> x generation 911 so this</font>

210
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:23,050
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have many interoperable</font>

211
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:25,870
plantations reasonably soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think and</font>

212
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,630
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate anybody taking a look</font>

213
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:32,560
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and give me any feedback</font>

214
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:34,930
questions this one's pretty simple and

215
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,760
and and fairly mature it's been around

216
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,589
for a while have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with a lot of</font>

217
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,330
these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> details making sure exactly</font>

218
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:44,440
how things are right but it's it's

219
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,850
actually a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty simple mechanism how</font>

220
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:53,399
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are following the draft read</font>

221
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:56,140
it keeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on what's going on ok</font>

222
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,220
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> plea for review I'd really</font>

223
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,870
appreciate it if people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

224
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:05,380
look at it wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you long so</font>

225
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:20,170
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a long draught ok ok sit for</font>

226
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:23,220
data only oops similar or similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

227
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">we get two slides in this one</font>

228
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:33,590
so similar gives you a way to return

229
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:36,530
location information on a fine service

230
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:39,860
response so this is used in two

231
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:41,959
circumstances one if you if you have a

232
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">valid location but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're missing some</font>

233
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,310
information that can occur when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send</font>

234
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,410
enough information<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the location</font>

235
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">information on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost request that we</font>

236
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,969
can uniquely identify at the location

237
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,030
but you may not have supplied enough

238
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,950
information that that we really like you

239
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,110
to have in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the location</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you send</font>

240
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,620
when you when you send that location an

241
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:07,430
emergency call a great example would be

242
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:10,070
you have a arm you have a street or for

243
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,589
which there really is<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one such</font>

244
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,030
street with the right Street house

245
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,220
number and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything else everything</font>

246
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:20,350
else is the same but you've misspelled

247
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:23,180
or or in some way mangle the city name

248
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:26,150
another great example is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you you</font>

249
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:30,550
you you don't include<font color="#E5E5E5"> the county or the</font>

250
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:32,449
a two-armed level information the the

251
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,420
911 authorities are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry the</font>

252
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,880
emergency call authorities really would

253
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,550
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have all locations have that a</font>

254
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,990
to information and but you've given us

255
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,319
enough information<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's only</font>

256
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:48,320
one city with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that name in the state and</font>

257
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,300
and we can supply that information back

258
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,370
so it's complete it gives you a complete

259
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,760
all the fields that we know about that

260
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,680
location you in that circumstance<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

261
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,220
have sent a valid location in so you're

262
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get a route out but there's</font>

263
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's information that we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

264
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,689
want to be able to return<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you so</font>

265
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:12,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can save it and send it in the</font>

266
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:14,510
emergency<font color="#E5E5E5"> call um the the the second use</font>

267
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,920
is when you send an invalid location so

268
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,540
this is when you send a piece of

269
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,280
information in but we cannot vote

270
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,230
uniquely locate you in them in the lost

271
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,209
database you don't get a route in this

272
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,210
case you get an error and you get a

273
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:33,500
there's three lists of valid invalid and

274
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,630
unchecked and you you know the

275
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,890
individual elements<font color="#CCCCCC"> of location</font>

276
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,710
information are put in one of those

277
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,370
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks so in this case what we're</font>

278
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,070
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font>

279
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,430
with is a valid location that is a maybe

280
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,950
you meant this so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a piece of</font>

281
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:52,040
helpful hopefully helpful information to

282
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:55,910
a user who's entered the an incorrect

283
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,829
location um we do the all the documents

284
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,630
for all of this say that it's highly

285
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">desirable to validate the location</font>

286
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,140
before you have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> emergency call right</font>

287
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,089
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that your location</font>

288
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,830
is valid before you have to go and get a

289
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,870
route for it so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

290
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:12,260
used way in advance when you first get

291
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,460
your service you put it in an address<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

292
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">you put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in an address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can't</font>

293
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,410
record<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't validate you need to</font>

294
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,400
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the valid location is</font>

295
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,219
and we're going to give you helpful

296
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,020
information give you a a valid piece of

297
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,200
information that said maybe you meant

298
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,089
this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the same mechanism</font>

299
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,850
it's just a way to return location

300
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:40,339
information in the fine service response

301
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:44,630
of a lost query next we have had several

302
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">reviews on this document and I i have</font>

303
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">updated the comment in response to those</font>

304
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,980
reviews one of them was quite extensive

305
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,170
extensive review and regret and gave me

306
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">several very very valuable comments</font>

307
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,339
which I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have implemented</font>

308
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,050
virtually all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I'm going to have</font>

309
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,390
that reviewer who's not here a damn

310
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,750
backs look to make sure that I've done

311
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:09,530
the right thing as part of working group

312
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:11,000
last call but this has received a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

313
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,949
interest from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nena guys they're real</font>

314
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,939
everybody is very very interested in

315
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,350
this and the mechanism is good for that

316
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,660
and that everything's<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we</font>

317
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,219
would again<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll get a bunch of reviews</font>

318
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,990
from them but anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room who's</font>

319
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,540
willing to review it this one's a little

320
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,120
bit you need to know lost pretty well to

321
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,510
kind of understand this is doing but if

322
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,330
you if you're familiar with RC 5222 then

323
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:38,450
then there the draft is actually fairly

324
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,699
short but if you don't understand lost

325
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,860
you'll you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will get lost reading this</font>

326
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,490
document yes yes yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to say that</font>

327
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:49,010
right so working group last call is

328
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,380
actually started i wrote i heard the

329
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,450
slides before they actually issued they

330
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,950
working group mascot which is great

331
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,460
which is unusual easy does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

332
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,990
minutes be yeah all right exactly yeah

333
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:07,380
it's right I had him several days

334
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:10,100
anything at smile but I I again I the

335
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mechanism is actually very simple</font>

336
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:19,879
but it it's it is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font>

337
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,260
use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more review</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and finally</font>

338
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,290
well any<font color="#CCCCCC"> clower people paying attention</font>

339
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,210
to this graph yeah we do it's mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

340
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">meaning we need reviews right working</font>

341
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,650
group last call yeah that process we're

342
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:34,409
asking people to review it see if they

343
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,780
agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mechanisms defined and</font>

344
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,240
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for editorial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nits if you</font>

345
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,250
don't like you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff for your</font>

346
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,440
keen on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff we do need people to</font>

347
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,750
review these things so is there anybody

348
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:54,450
volunteering to do help us with a

349
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:58,530
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group last call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dale hit that's</font>

350
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:00,360
all I will get a bunch of reviews from

351
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,790
from from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nena guys they want this</font>

352
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,360
pretty bad so I can fashion<font color="#E5E5E5"> Minh get</font>

353
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,360
them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> review it</font>

354
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:21,299
and finally we have planned changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

355
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:25,449
one is a a mechanism to deal with the

356
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:28,330
reality that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data in the lost server</font>

357
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,120
changes slowly over time an easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

358
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,769
is they build a new road in a town<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

359
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,498
we've got to add that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that piece of</font>

360
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:43,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">information another example is that a</font>

361
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:45,159
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a of a run at what we in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

362
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:47,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's called an unincorporated community</font>

363
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:50,320
it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> area that is not in a city but</font>

364
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:52,209
near a city and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the city expands its</font>

365
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,610
boundary to take that area in we call

366
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:58,240
that annexation there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other terms</font>

367
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:00,939
used in other countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> but those</font>

368
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,649
changes are an actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> change in the</font>

369
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,840
address the address changes because

370
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:09,039
instead of having the name of the

371
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,539
community the a four-level be you know

372
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,759
like the county name or some

373
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:16,419
neighborhood name it changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the</font>

374
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:18,909
name of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> city so what was valid is no</font>

375
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:21,129
longer valid that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> planned change</font>

376
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:23,289
these kinds of changes happen on a

377
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:26,740
schedule they say at midnight on this

378
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:29,200
date these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change yes and</font>

379
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:33,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">drug since they were in a city here but</font>

380
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:37,029
25 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a lot of plan name</font>

381
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,769
changes yes indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it did we're in a</font>

382
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:44,129
city that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had an are quite a number of</font>

383
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:49,360
planned changes thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and um so um</font>

384
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:53,080
that that mechanism is so that that

385
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:57,008
happens um today the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only way that we</font>

386
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,320
have to to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate issues</font>

387
00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:02,529
like this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's this statement</font>

388
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,840
in in phone bcp that says you should

389
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,570
validate periodical you should

390
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,668
revalidate periodically so that you have

391
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,139
a valid location every once in a while

392
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">you should check to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that it's</font>

393
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:19,168
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a really lousy way to</font>

394
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:22,149
handle a plan change um the the way this

395
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:25,180
so the whole mechanism what

396
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:27,970
that revalidate is a pull mechanism what

397
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,010
this draft proposes is a push mechanism

398
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,140
it's a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font>

399
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,660
that these locations will become invalid

400
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,820
at a certain time or will change at a

401
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,960
certain time and the way we do that is

402
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:44,620
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we save a URI in the lost server</font>

403
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,520
that we poke if you if a changes is

404
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:50,260
going to be made so when you do a

405
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,660
validation request you can supply a URI

406
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,700
that you or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be saved in the lost</font>

407
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,070
database and whenever that location

408
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,480
changes that you are I that you provided

409
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,000
will be poked to tell you that that

410
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,310
happens it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all optional at the server</font>

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,470
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server can have lots of control or</font>

412
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,720
what you are eyes it will or won't save

413
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,460
you are not guaranteed that your eyes

414
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,320
you give it will be saved you are not

415
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,480
guaranteed that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can give them you</font>

416
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,850
know there's limit on the size of the or

417
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,650
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can only have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them for a given</font>

418
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,389
source you know there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of limits</font>

419
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,190
on what this this does so that it

420
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,410
doesn't overload anybody but the the

421
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,200
normal case is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only be</font>

422
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,210
one two or three maybe you are eyes

423
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,000
against a given location of a finite

424
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:34,390
size um the other thing it does is it

425
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">provides an input variable called as of</font>

426
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:40,300
that lets you ask the server will<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

427
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:43,150
location that i gave you be valid as of

428
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:46,300
this date<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a way to make sure</font>

429
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can create that when this plan</font>

430
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,250
change happens on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a known schedule that</font>

431
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can validate ahead of the change</font>

432
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:57,340
that your proposed new address will be

433
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,860
valid as of the date of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the change so</font>

434
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,020
you can you can that you'll get this

435
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,909
notification that says this is going to

436
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">become invalid you know five days from</font>

437
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,740
now you can three days from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

438
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">location you can say well what if I</font>

439
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:15,630
changed it to this as of you know five

440
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:18,250
days from<font color="#E5E5E5"> now found four days from now</font>

441
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:20,770
would it be valid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the the</font>

442
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,630
server can say yes well as of that day

443
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,150
it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid you asked me about it</font>

444
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:32,050
today it's invalid in five days it would

445
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:33,820
be valid um so um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft has been</font>

446
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,530
around for a while we did adopt that as

447
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:41,970
a working group draft

448
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:46,780
um and the so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have issued a 0-0 of</font>

449
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:48,400
drafty crit it's again a fairly simple

450
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,899
mechanism but if you don't understand

451
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,350
that lost works once again it's pretty

452
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,380
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> do basically just adds this uri as</font>

453
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,850
an input parameter that you can save

454
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,860
gives you an object<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can send to</font>

455
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,659
that you are I to tell you that as a

456
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,990
change has been made and gives you this

457
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:09,310
as a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that lets you say will it be</font>

458
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:12,040
valid as of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific date this is a</font>

459
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:14,980
real problem encountered by real

460
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:18,280
implementations that they know they're

461
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also deals with a</font>

462
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,649
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we discovered in</font>

463
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,990
implementation which is that because

464
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:28,540
phone bcp says periodically revalidate

465
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:32,230
the number of transactions on the lost

466
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:34,899
server that are revalidation is two or

467
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:38,350
three orders of magnitude more than the

468
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:41,350
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other operations on the law</font>

469
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,840
server so the law servers has to be

470
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,969
scaled much much much larger just

471
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,879
because of that periodic revalidation

472
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:51,160
we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn that pull notion into</font>

473
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,590
a push mechanism so that we can reduce

474
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the load on the law sir it's really the</font>

475
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:59,050
validation part of the sir so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

476
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:02,110
deployment experience tells us we made a

477
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:04,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">mistake periodic revalidation is causing</font>

478
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:07,360
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of load that we didn't anticipate</font>

479
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:14,950
and we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn that mechanism</font>

480
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:17,350
around make it push so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have not had</font>

481
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">very many reviews on this I'm asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

482
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bunch of reviews once again I will go</font>

483
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,139
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nena guys because they are the</font>

484
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:27,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the problem here but I</font>

485
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:33,250
appreciate people people looking at it

486
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:37,030
and give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> some reviews yes Randall</font>

487
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:39,070
Randall gallons so I did look at the

488
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,500
draft but it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while ago and I I</font>

489
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:45,939
don't remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot about it so</font>

490
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:48,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">refreshed so the intent of the way this</font>

491
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to be used is this going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

492
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,178
used by

493
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,240
random clients out in the world every

494
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:57,610
time they want to know what

495
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,170
infrastructure to infrastructure kind of

496
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,740
view it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> less operator will to use</font>

497
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:05,260
this so and then it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some kind of</font>

498
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,600
security language in there about you

499
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:11,799
know not allowing the saved you are I to

500
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:15,129
be a source of malware spin and that

501
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:19,150
kind of stuff I mean it as well I mean

502
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:20,679
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a URI so you you you don't</font>

503
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,480
retrieve anything from that you are you

504
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,120
only you only do a post to that your eye

505
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,970
right but right ozone to let any

506
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,830
arbitrary person give you yeah there's

507
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,809
there's you should look at the text the

508
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,159
security the security considerations is

509
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:37,120
an important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of this particular</font>

510
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:39,429
document and and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to think</font>

511
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,090
through make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we can't you</font>

512
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:45,220
can't get a malicious you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps</font>

513
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,439
that you can only post right there's no

514
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,020
no data you're getting back but

515
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,110
nonetheless you could get a you know you

516
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:56,110
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a an error you know it could</font>

517
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,540
be no we know where you could cause some

518
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:00,010
innocent party to be sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> out sure</font>

519
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why they're you limit the number</font>

520
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,980
right so that you can't do it's not it's

521
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,928
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to do an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application attack</font>

522
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,360
you will you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will poke you know you will</font>

523
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:15,070
try to push a piece of document to some

524
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">things yes the the you you would like to</font>

525
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">know who who is requesting this you have</font>

526
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> occur you would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have you</font>

527
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,400
should have a policy and I pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I</font>

528
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about this i maybe i'll have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

529
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,730
go back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at what i wrote about</font>

530
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:32,559
this but the identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> human your actions</font>

531
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,679
that the server should reflect the

532
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,049
identity of the entity who's asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

533
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,309
it but the any idea then this is

534
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:40,960
infrastructure infrastructure but

535
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:44,040
they'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these potentially one</font>

536
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,080
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> safety or eyes / requester /</font>

537
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,690
location for<font color="#E5E5E5"> saved validated address</font>

538
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,460
right but but think about as again Anna

539
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,380
practical thing that the number of

540
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,540
Lissa's with the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is going</font>

541
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:58,660
to be you know one two<font color="#CCCCCC"> three it's how</font>

542
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">many surely so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your says providers there</font>

543
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,410
are four that address you've got the

544
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,210
equivalent of the of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> M sag and</font>

545
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:07,060
you've got some large number of

546
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,610
addresses in there yeah and so you're

547
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,710
going to have some number of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

548
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:14,199
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> validator</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address oh yeah</font>

549
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,000
yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's again in the in</font>

550
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,220
the scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> of databases that's that's</font>

551
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,280
pretty small as long as there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

552
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,990
only three of them right if there were

553
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">5,000 of them per record then maybe it</font>

554
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:28,210
would be a concern and and and there is

555
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,949
definitely advise about you know

556
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:35,980
bluemont how many of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> you handle</font>

557
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:39,250
any other questions or comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

558
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:43,420
I'm done reviews again same with this

559
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,450
there are three<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy drafts to read we</font>

560
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,010
put them in working group last<font color="#E5E5E5"> calls or</font>

561
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,410
asking for people to review them and

562
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,740
obviously we'll go to the list with that

563
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,740
also

564
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:10,550
this one first Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're next is this</font>

565
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:19,850
one first oh you can't see that kidney

566
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:38,540
huh maybe if I do this and look for the

567
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:43,100
screen is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so actually version 10 of</font>

568
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:46,100
the e comment was published today so

569
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:50,090
that is now available the major changes

570
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:54,439
since version 7 which was the last real

571
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:58,570
big revision in order to align with some

572
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:04,160
work that went on in 3gpp the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSD is now</font>

573
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:06,500
transported using<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PE are encoding</font>

574
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:11,470
which is a binary encoding it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

575
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:15,230
longer in<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML and furthermore there's a</font>

576
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:18,710
mid call<font color="#E5E5E5"> to normally Andy call the</font>

577
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:20,600
vehicle sends though the MSD in the

578
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,180
initial invite and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the piece app</font>

579
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,760
sends a response acknowledging that in

580
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,220
the reply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the invite and normally</font>

581
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it but there are cases where a</font>

582
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,650
pset might want to request an updated

583
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:36,590
MSD mid call so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that happens is</font>

584
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:39,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece app sends an info message to</font>

585
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:43,280
the vehicle and says please send me an

586
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:45,770
MSD before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text said that the</font>

587
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,649
vehicle<font color="#CCCCCC"> would send that reply MSD in the</font>

588
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:51,470
reply to the info now the vehicle sends

589
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:57,230
a new info message with the requested

590
00:30:51,470 --> 00:31:01,130
MSD in it the info package template was

591
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:03,380
filled out with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more text added an</font>

592
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,860
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that showed info and then one of</font>

593
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:09,800
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> big changes is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

594
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:12,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">the econ draft creates the mechanism</font>

595
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,240
with this control object and so forth

596
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:19,309
that's reused by the car

597
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">ashcraft there were some items in the</font>

598
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:24,420
metadata control object that were used

599
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,970
for car crash<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were not necessary</font>

600
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,370
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> eCall so by request those were all</font>

601
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,170
moved out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the e call document and put</font>

602
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,309
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car crash document as</font>

603
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:39,330
extensions so that's and there are a lot

604
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:41,610
of editorial changes and I can go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

605
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,919
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next slide which helps about where I</font>

606
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,870
got comments from yes so we get a lot of

607
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,630
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the number of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

608
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:51,300
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank all of them we had a lot</font>

609
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,610
of editorial changes resulting from that

610
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:56,370
and then the big technical changes that

611
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,990
i mentioned before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

612
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,300
Christopher especially for spending a

613
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:06,600
lot of time I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got things in</font>

614
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:09,030
a really good shape now next slide yeah

615
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,550
so there's really just to open issues

616
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,860
remaining one is a related to where I

617
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:16,290
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a second ago about moving</font>

618
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,840
the stuff that wasn't directly needed

619
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,399
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> eCall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the Eco document to the</font>

620
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,678
car crash and one of those is a

621
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,900
capabilities element that gets sent from

622
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,510
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vehicle to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piece app to let the</font>

623
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,250
pset know what the vehicles capabilities

624
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,990
are so the pset will not request

625
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:34,200
anything that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vehicle does not</font>

626
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:37,110
support so there was a suggestion to

627
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,850
move that capabilities object back into

628
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,340
the e call document but make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> optional</font>

629
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,860
so that if the vehicle does not send a

630
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,510
capabilities object it means its

631
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,340
capabilities are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the minimum set</font>

632
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,800
required for<font color="#CCCCCC"> eCall in the e call</font>

633
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,610
document but then the car crash would

634
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:57,350
then make the capabilities mandatory the

635
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:59,879
other open issue is about the use of

636
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,730
about the info package registration

637
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,910
right now the e call document says that

638
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:09,929
the e call<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the info package I</font>

639
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:12,210
can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send a body part a mime</font>

640
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:14,850
type that's listed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> emergency call</font>

641
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:17,280
data set and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's been some debate</font>

642
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:20,309
about whether that's legal / the info

643
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,340
document if it is legal everything's

644
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:27,379
cool if it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal then we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

645
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,379
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> options</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one option is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

646
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,809
one option is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we require because</font>

647
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:36,129
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose of making this registry</font>

648
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:39,440
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a list of static list is that</font>

649
00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:42,769
the way this gets extended is that we've

650
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,899
seen right now for<font color="#CCCCCC"> eCall we have MS D</font>

651
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:46,789
which is the data set from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vehicle</font>

652
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:48,979
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the peace app for for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Penn you're</font>

653
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:51,590
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> II call in North America we have a</font>

654
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,899
different data set<font color="#E5E5E5"> beds so potentially</font>

655
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">other regions as they start coming up</font>

656
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:59,508
with implementations of this general

657
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,730
mechanism will start defining their own

658
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:03,379
data sets and if we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that we</font>

659
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,899
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it as easy as possible for</font>

660
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:07,969
them to simply define the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mime type for</font>

661
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:09,618
this data set without having to go

662
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,859
through a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work published an RFC</font>

663
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:14,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth so one option would be that</font>

664
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:16,369
we require<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new info package</font>

665
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:20,149
registration that would include

666
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:22,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything in the earlier ones for every</font>

667
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:25,040
new mime type that might get deployed in

668
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:27,679
a different region another option which

669
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,099
is kludgy<font color="#CCCCCC"> ER but avoids the legalistic</font>

670
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:34,700
argument would be that we don't use info

671
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:37,099
we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> reinvite or options or something</font>

672
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:38,569
like that but some other sit message

673
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:41,060
that doesn't have the legalistic

674
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:42,918
restrictions a third<font color="#E5E5E5"> option is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

675
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,799
define and this is all so ugly and

676
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:49,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">occlude but perfectly legal I think you</font>

677
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:53,899
define a a mime type that that says

678
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:56,719
multi-part emergency services data and

679
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:59,900
then put a parameter in there and what

680
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:02,480
you do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for info you</font>

681
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,400
just take your actual mind type and cram

682
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,410
it into this multi-part as an extra

683
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,690
wrapper around it so that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> info</font>

684
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:11,180
package only has the one mime type it's

685
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,790
horribly ugly but it would get<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

686
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:18,549
the wording of the info package

687
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:18,550
restriction so there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it</font>

688
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:31,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">christer and Krista Homburg yes first of</font>

689
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:34,470
all I also like to thank you for we've

690
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,830
given a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments and things which</font>

691
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:39,689
came out from<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TPP other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comments</font>

692
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,990
that you had and things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going very</font>

693
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:44,070
smoothly but as you say there are there

694
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,589
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few open issues I think</font>

695
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:48,480
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one more issue than this also</font>

696
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,190
which was raised by my colleague which

697
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,000
you're discussing offline was this usage

698
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:59,850
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Content ID and and and and and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font>

699
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:04,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">in forward but I think but that's the</font>

700
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:07,230
main issue is this in for and and i'll

701
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:09,150
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be short but I mean we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

702
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">previously we had this legacy info</font>

703
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,630
before we did in<font color="#CCCCCC"> four packages</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

704
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,310
were a lot of problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that people</font>

705
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,350
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for all kind of things there were</font>

706
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:18,000
no real semantics associated with it you

707
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,290
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supported</font>

708
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,080
and what they were going to do when they

709
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:24,779
receive is so so we define the info

710
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,330
package which has all the semantics and

711
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,780
and one thing which just info package

712
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:33,870
does say is that you define which mime

713
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,960
types are associated with which this

714
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:39,029
info package now the way it's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

715
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">in equal is a different instead of</font>

716
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:45,690
listening these<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine times it says that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you can use any mind x mm I'm pipe which</font>

00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:52,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">exists in this specific I on our</font>

719
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:55,650
registry so whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to use</font>

720
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:58,500
something new they don't need to define

00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">an info package they just add stuff into</font>

722
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:05,040
this I in our registry and that is my

723
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:09,570
main issue because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

724
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,830
it cydia mean we don't know in the long

725
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,390
run what people are going to put there

726
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:15,000
as long as they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> justify it somehow</font>

727
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:17,850
being in you know emergency related and

728
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,940
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> example or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I also think it gives</font>

729
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:22,200
a bad precedence I've given example I

730
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,450
will give it I don't know it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font>

731
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:28,560
one but assume that someone registers a

732
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:31,109
nympho package for transporting you know

733
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,720
game online game<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and they</font>

734
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:35,070
create iono registry for online game

735
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">mime types</font>

736
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:39,480
we start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these games 10</font>

737
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:41,730
games hundred games 200 games they all

738
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,800
define their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> mime type and they all</font>

739
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,290
put this into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> saints registry and</font>

740
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,390
use the same info package so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

741
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:51,060
it's it's it's a slippery slope and a

742
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">dangerous way to go so my suggestion is</font>

743
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:56,670
really and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this original</font>

744
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,460
intention of info package when you need

745
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,050
something new you define a new info

746
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,880
package<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said here earlier you</font>

747
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,770
mentioned RFC but that's not true you

748
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need an RFC to define a new in the</font>

749
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,170
package its specification required and

750
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,630
an expert review so you can define<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

751
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:14,430
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe any you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

752
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:17,700
Chinese Americans whatever they they

753
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:21,240
find is it can be done and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> an info</font>

754
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:24,060
packages<font color="#E5E5E5"> rrrr</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chi in that sense so I</font>

755
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,399
really think that should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done we list</font>

756
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:29,900
explicitly the info packages and these

757
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,220
are my<font color="#CCCCCC"> plans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you use and nothing else</font>

758
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,990
also what's important to think that this

759
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,359
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the mine finds another</font>

760
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:39,240
thing which we have in the info package

761
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:42,720
is a section where you need to either

762
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:46,259
define or reference a specification

763
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,689
which describes how this info package is

764
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:52,860
used and that of course includes how the

765
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:54,510
mime types are used so now assuming that

766
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,490
you're adding a new mime time to this

767
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,980
registry which coming into this info

768
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:02,270
package you would also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update</font>

769
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,560
this add a reference to the

770
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:08,520
specification which now describes the

771
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,190
usage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mime type and so on and</font>

772
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,080
maybe it could be doing something else

773
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,240
maybe it could affect some of the other

774
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,040
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> which are in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the info</font>

775
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,799
package rate whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we</font>

776
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,630
don't know so then you would have to

777
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,670
update the info package and there is

778
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,290
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> no procedure for updating the</font>

779
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,300
info package the actual template that

780
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:29,910
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> provided to Anna there is no no</font>

781
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,580
mechanism for that so my suggestion and

782
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:34,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have said offline I am willing to help</font>

783
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:37,230
whatever I can do to do that is we

784
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,020
define this info package we call for

785
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:42,060
ikura cars crash sorry they we define

786
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,130
our another waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for package we can</font>

787
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,020
use similar name no problem we can even

788
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,000
it's a lot of copy paste we can do and

789
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,000
then for you know

790
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Asia whoever needs they do in their info</font>

791
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,530
box I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a clean way is the</font>

792
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,660
way you know exactly what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you</font>

793
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:59,460
don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and look in this rigid</font>

794
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:03,390
tree where there's something new<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

795
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:06,030
there even though and so on and I think

796
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:08,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a generic way to do it I know</font>

797
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:09,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is this capabilities in this</font>

798
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:12,510
specific case there make an instant that

799
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,190
we have done so we can know what

800
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">supported but I don't think that's way</font>

801
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,730
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should go that individual info</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packet</font>

802
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">is start defining their own inclination</font>

803
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,890
a mechanism that not what we should do

804
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,960
there is a common negotiation mechanism

805
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:27,660
which you when you send your invite you

806
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,090
include this receive info header field

807
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,980
which name<font color="#E5E5E5"> stain for package if I</font>

808
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:34,500
support this in package and I know which

809
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">mine pies are associated I everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

810
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,240
good so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really think that i strongly</font>

811
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:45,870
think we should do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> here also sorry</font>

812
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:48,569
for for you know yes got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

813
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:50,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">I again I didn't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up here</font>

814
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,260
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> afree I really</font>

815
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,669
appreciate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work that's been done i'm</font>

816
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,440
really thankful for that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we'd</font>

817
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,090
love got done a lot of progress but this

818
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:05,930
is the main issue where we unfortunately

819
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:08,550
are not on the same page<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prime rozum the</font>

820
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:10,649
when you add a new block of data all

821
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,650
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is adding a piece of data</font>

822
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:17,460
right it's a hunk of<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML that we're</font>

823
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:20,610
sending between the entities right we

824
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:23,610
need to decide what level overview is

825
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:26,670
appropriate to add a piece of data using

826
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:28,830
the mechanism for providing if we decide

827
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,960
that specification review is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

828
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:32,640
level a specification requires the right

829
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,800
level of documentation to add a new

830
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing then adding to the registry should</font>

831
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,000
have specification required if we decide

832
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:41,820
that that's not an appropriate level of

833
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,640
documentation it's too much overhead for

834
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:47,310
the for the kind of information that we

835
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,250
have then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

836
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,980
expert review by requiring that you were

837
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:54,960
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new info package you are</font>

838
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:57,420
demanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do specification</font>

839
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,680
required that might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want but</font>

840
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,480
it isn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision that we're making</font>

841
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,259
it's just you got to do it that way

842
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's what</font>

843
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:07,980
nation what when<font color="#CCCCCC"> m.phil says it is low</font>

844
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,680
overhead we can build a template that

845
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">says to do a nympho package you know</font>

846
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,140
filling these blanks done so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

847
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:18,930
huge it's not a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of overhead</font>

848
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:22,379
specification required is more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

849
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:24,899
know a review and other things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

850
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">it some well if you read the definition</font>

851
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,780
of standards required it's a lot more

852
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:33,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">than just document required Krista I'm</font>

853
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:36,900
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about standard required what</font>

854
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:38,790
maybe I remember the definition maybe I

855
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,030
remember the definition of specification

856
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:44,120
required wrong but my what I what what

857
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:48,600
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is needed is there needs to be a</font>

858
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:50,160
publicly available document which takes

859
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,870
per trigger account because the expert

860
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,980
reviewer needs to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

861
00:42:51,870 --> 00:43:00,980
it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be an RFC it doesn't</font>

862
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:03,240
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be an opposite exactly so yeah</font>

863
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,770
classification just means specification

864
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,299
you have it there in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you yes</font>

865
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,280
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a standard does not have to</font>

866
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:14,390
have consensus just has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be written</font>

867
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:17,220
down yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean how does sleep yeah</font>

868
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:18,930
right so but but all I'm Sam<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just</font>

869
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,430
for reinforcing the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's</font>

870
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,399
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to repeat it right we need to</font>

871
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:26,220
decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the level of control that we</font>

872
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,080
want / adding another hunk of data if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

873
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,899
decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that specification required is</font>

874
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:35,460
appropriate great let's do that by

875
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:37,680
pushing my requiring info we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

876
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,150
to make that we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it stronger</font>

877
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,950
right we can say and adding something

878
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,480
that a registry takes more than

879
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,220
specification required I don't think

880
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,740
we're going to do that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could but</font>

881
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,629
we're stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the minimum level of</font>

882
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,919
specification report which may or may

883
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,890
not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate I happen to think</font>

884
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,420
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not appropriate but we can we can</font>

885
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:58,560
we can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that decision independently</font>

886
00:43:54,420 --> 00:44:03,840
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in favor of playing</font>

887
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:06,930
games with the the sip info package RFC

888
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,390
right if if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SIP guys say no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

889
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:11,399
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that he's right you got to</font>

890
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,410
specify what mimetypes going the package

891
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,060
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the story we're going</font>

892
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it</font>

893
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:19,770
and just are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my pain for a point of</font>

894
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,510
interest the chairs are trying to

895
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:23,810
solicit help to look at that and decide

896
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:31,170
make that decision to outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

897
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:33,120
community right Robert<font color="#CCCCCC"> good yeah and</font>

898
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:36,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ryland yeah I have a lot of sympathy for</font>

899
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,509
krista's points here I think the reason

900
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,620
we did all this work to come up with

901
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,660
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of info with the</font>

902
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,670
info packages rules to prevent the kind

903
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">of proprietary explosion of the use of</font>

904
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:49,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">info which info wichman didn't</font>

905
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:53,280
interoperate and I feared if we add

906
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:54,750
these ad mimetypes our outsides of the

907
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,920
control of the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> package that</font>

908
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,800
effectively you've got different

909
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,770
versions of the same package that aren't

910
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,270
going to interoperate as Brian said I

911
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,960
think we can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a template you</font>

912
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:09,090
can be very clear we put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the RFC</font>

913
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:13,140
this is the template if you want to add

914
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:16,230
add a new a new usage then this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

915
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,000
you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this how you create the at the</font>

916
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,910
what you would put your specification

917
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,560
you just fill in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blanks so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

918
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:26,940
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just play devil's advocate for</font>

919
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">a moment I think I very well understand</font>

920
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,720
the concern that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys have about the</font>

921
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:33,420
reason there's info package and the

922
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,250
reason requirements and how allowing us

923
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,170
to do this could potentially create a

924
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:39,810
slippery slope that allows you know the

925
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:42,480
game people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just go hog-wild with</font>

926
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:44,460
completely different types of data with

927
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,950
completely different semantics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

928
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,710
so forth and that would be a mess but

929
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:52,109
just to play devil's advocate if I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

930
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:54,090
game designer trying to do that sort of

931
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,220
thing I could easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that with info</font>

932
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:58,710
now several different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

933
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,830
define one mime type and just say this

934
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind pipe contains XML or JSON or</font>

935
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:05,340
whatever and then I put whatever I want

936
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,740
in there that has wildly different

937
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:13,650
semantics and sizes and rates and

938
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:16,979
everything else yeah this is uh on this

939
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:19,650
is hummus yeah i think the case that

940
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,330
Krista<font color="#E5E5E5"> are provided here sort of de</font>

941
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">bourrée seems a little bit constructed</font>

942
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:29,960
I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that you come up with</font>

943
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:29,960
gaming the gaming community is is is

944
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:35,609
no no it's like it's like is this a real

945
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,859
concern like literally the gaming

946
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:40,170
community of writing sip applications

947
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:42,989
and then putting stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> in for emergency</font>

948
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:44,309
service to must be kidding right now

949
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:47,099
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would use emergency</font>

950
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:49,319
services you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> they oversee I</font>

951
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:52,109
said that they would define<font color="#CCCCCC"> dated would</font>

952
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:54,839
define their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> iono registry for</font>

953
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:57,119
gaming<font color="#CCCCCC"> mimetypes and they even then they</font>

954
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,400
would one have one single info package

955
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,469
which points to that registry and then

956
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,930
everyone starts putting these these mime

957
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:06,089
types into the same registry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all</font>

958
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,669
gets associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one single info</font>

959
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:10,469
package I'll eat I didn't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

960
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:11,430
were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the emergency iono</font>

961
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:13,619
registry but they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

962
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:18,509
dosometing<font color="#CCCCCC"> sim similar with their own</font>

963
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:20,459
owner registry basically allowing you to

964
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:22,469
have one info packager then people can

965
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:24,649
start adding adding adding mimetypes

966
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:28,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet that's what I want to avoid and</font>

967
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:30,209
and of course you know anyone can define

968
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:32,430
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML type which is very flexible on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

969
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:35,489
we can't prevent that but I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> but but</font>

970
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:37,678
I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a reason for us to do</font>

971
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:39,449
you know the wrong thing just by saying

972
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,759
yeah but someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this but</font>

973
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:44,099
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we do we should do what's right</font>

974
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:48,449
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know that's over sure but</font>

975
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:50,279
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if the reason to make it's the</font>

976
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:53,130
reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to do something in a more</font>

977
00:47:50,279 --> 00:47:56,869
difficult way which isn't the semantics

978
00:47:53,130 --> 00:48:00,989
that we want is to prevent us<font color="#E5E5E5"> from being</font>

979
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:04,439
a precedent<font color="#CCCCCC"> for somebody else to do the</font>

980
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:06,329
wrong thing even without us being that

981
00:48:04,439 --> 00:48:09,089
precedent people who want to do the

982
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:11,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong thing can do the wrong thing Chris</font>

983
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:14,130
I don't think it's easier because even

984
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:16,170
in even if we would move forward this

985
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:20,009
way there<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text needed</font>

986
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:22,380
we need text either an update to RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> 68</font>

987
00:48:20,009 --> 00:48:23,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">is 86 or something describing how this</font>

988
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,549
is done yes you can create these

989
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:28,558
registers and all these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and</font>

990
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:30,509
we need rules how it's done how do you

991
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,449
update the info package there would be a

992
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:36,900
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work not for you maybe because</font>

993
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:39,599
this would be maybe for me so I I think

994
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,029
that they finally news effect is really

995
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,609
the easiest way to do it

996
00:48:41,029 --> 00:48:45,769
you need to write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little text but then</font>

997
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:48,499
it's done and it's clear and no one has

998
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:50,598
any any you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's no ambiguity as</font>

999
00:48:48,499 --> 00:48:52,249
also so just a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> check we get like</font>

1000
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:53,599
six minutes and he's got to be get

1001
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:58,069
through this one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that six minutes</font>

1002
00:48:53,599 --> 00:49:00,409
video d of my working with 3gpp as well

1003
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:03,558
and I also support krista i think if we

1004
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:06,909
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a precedence here I mean when we</font>

1005
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:10,549
looking at the SIP protocol in 3gpp

1006
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:12,380
there are people who look if there are

1007
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:15,380
any holes where they can sneak something

1008
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:17,329
in what you're doing here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

1009
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:28,759
fan of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least not when I'm here</font>

1010
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:31,909
in this meetings so but first from big

1011
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:34,069
to bed no I I just think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should go</font>

1012
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:37,400
along the lines that the sip info

1013
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:40,849
protocol a message was intended to and

1014
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:44,209
we had long debates in 3gpp as well how

1015
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:46,309
we can use info<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are very restrictive</font>

1016
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:49,509
in this usage and I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can also be</font>

1017
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:52,099
that here and not open some doors debts

1018
00:49:49,509 --> 00:49:54,049
maybe even if somebody wants to misuse

1019
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:56,209
info on cramster<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling like I said</font>

1020
00:49:54,049 --> 00:50:00,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's plenty of ways to do it they</font>

1021
00:49:56,209 --> 00:50:01,729
don't violate the letter of the RFC so

1022
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,469
and rollin well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would hope that the</font>

1023
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:07,009
expert review of the info package would

1024
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:09,499
at least catch some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those if it looks</font>

1025
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:11,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">like you're just basic regni generic</font>

1026
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:13,158
container to stuff in whatever you like

1027
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:14,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">means gear up said in 20 PP we could</font>

1028
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:16,729
create a nympho package called free to

1029
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,919
BP application and just like for

1030
00:50:16,729 --> 00:50:21,890
everything in the future and I have to

1031
00:50:18,919 --> 00:50:24,109
come back to ITF again this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not what</font>

1032
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:25,578
we want to encourage so and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1033
00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:27,109
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really that hard pretty much</font>

1034
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:29,479
we can fill out the whole template in

1035
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:31,400
the RSC<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a registration template and</font>

1036
00:50:29,479 --> 00:50:32,808
you just need and identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just need</font>

1037
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,119
to fill in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this bit in this bit and this</font>

1038
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:38,089
bit we will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we'll have two</font>

1039
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,339
examples right one for equal one for

1040
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:43,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful car crash and it shouldn't be</font>

1041
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:46,009
that difficult well but the issue isn't

1042
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:48,319
with what we do for eco and car crash

1043
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:51,890
the issue is what does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next region</font>

1044
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:53,990
that might need that good so ms t is one

1045
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,759
set of data in North America<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ruiz</font>

1046
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,819
beds which is a pretty flexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of</font>

1047
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,350
data but what happens if China or

1048
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:02,780
Australia or Saudi Arabia or some other

1049
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:04,368
region or country decides they want

1050
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that isn't quite beds they</font>

1051
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:09,050
want their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own data set so what the RFC</font>

1052
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:10,850
with the documents say now is well you

1053
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:13,190
define a mime type of you add it to the

1054
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:15,529
registry and everything else is exactly

1055
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,350
the same so can I say in addition to the

1056
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:20,090
mime type you're going to have to have

1057
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:21,950
specification for the info package which

1058
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:25,280
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian points out the case of just the</font>

1059
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">doc requires it I'm sorry specifications</font>

1060
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,700
just the document that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

1061
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,770
publicly available document and

1062
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:34,009
following that template so we provide

1063
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:35,720
them a template and we identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1064
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:39,230
here fill<font color="#E5E5E5"> out your own stuff fill out</font>

1065
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:41,259
your own stuff it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

1066
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:43,820
a huge piece of documentation and

1067
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:45,260
basically we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want good documentation so</font>

1068
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,820
we can implement that thing without

1069
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:50,560
having to go for all kinds of hoops and

1070
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:53,510
hurdles in order to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what it is</font>

1071
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,310
yes free<font color="#E5E5E5"> successor so sorry Saudis will</font>

1072
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,080
have to define their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own info baggage</font>

1073
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:59,150
and I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an issue and I</font>

1074
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,920
mean no matter what is gonna I assume

1075
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:03,440
they're gonna document it sound wearing

1076
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,420
some documents right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so no matter how</font>

1077
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,000
it's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> there jit they're just not</font>

1078
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,980
gonna send an email to iono and hey here

1079
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,980
is our mime type and then it's not

1080
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:15,410
occupant anywhere I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1081
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:17,090
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> even I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what the ITF</font>

1082
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:19,160
procedures for registering new mime

1083
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,990
types are but I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1084
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,359
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna pass either just someone</font>

1085
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:26,000
saying please please register is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my time</font>

1086
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,650
without any indication what's in it so

1087
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,780
they will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define any info</font>

1088
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:32,900
package day you know write it down and

1089
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,640
it's it's it's not that difficult I mean

1090
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,700
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too much information that</font>

1091
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:40,160
you need to provide the the real the

1092
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,600
real stuff is is how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it and that</font>

1093
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,368
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to define it somewhere</font>

1094
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,009
else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expert review</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it look at</font>

1095
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:48,020
that and and day for package template

1096
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:52,160
with reference to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1097
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:54,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">good okay so let's get through this real</font>

1098
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,549
quick sure that one I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy Mike I</font>

1099
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:57,080
want my<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minute to the skirt okay</font>

1100
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:01,490
well actually there's this really very

1101
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:03,080
little say on this um<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's just</font>

1102
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:05,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">a mirror of it I mean the stuff that</font>

1103
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,609
came out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> he call was moved the econ</font>

1104
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,000
metadata control object was moved in

1105
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:10,279
here

1106
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,160
there are a lot of editorial changes and

1107
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:17,030
I think that's it so once we decide

1108
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:18,589
whether we're moving the the

1109
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,510
capabilities object whether we're

1110
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:22,520
leaving it here or moving it back into

1111
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:25,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">eCall so it forms like part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the base</font>

1112
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:28,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">pack for extension here that's really</font>

1113
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:32,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only open issue that affects this</font>

1114
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:34,640
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Rosen in the interest of</font>

1115
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:36,470
fairness I just looked up the

1118
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:49,220
required well it depends correct it it

depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on well write it depends on</font>

1121
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,380
right it we probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to specify</font>

1122
00:53:55,670 --> 00:54:14,630
that if we allow it to be in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor</font>

1123
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:16,280
tree re if we if we have comments please

1124
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:19,370
use the mic if we don't have comments

1125
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,410
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done here thanks Randy oakdale</font>

1126
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:23,089
one quick ones got to be quick well what

1127
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:25,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the microphone and rylan</font>

again is at least for public safety

1129
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:28,340
applications in different regions I

1130
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:31,640
would hope they would be at the vendor

1131
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:34,580
tree I'm sorry for<font color="#CCCCCC"> public safety</font>

1132
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:36,020
application isn't like car crash I hope

1133
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:38,180
they wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in the vendor tree</font>

1134
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:40,040
right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely not and</font>

1135
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:42,169
particularly because what we're really

1136
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,460
talking about here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is as various not</font>

1137
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:45,530
just public safety we're talking about

1138
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:48,410
vehicle initiated emergency calls and

1139
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:51,020
we're talking about region specific data

1140
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:53,600
sets for them car manufacturers would

1141
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,880
probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement this all of</font>

1142
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,529
the regions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same vehicle so that</font>

1143
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vehicle just knows what to send</font>

1144
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:01,820
based based on where it is you wouldn't

1145
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:04,580
couldn't do that in the vendor tree you

1146
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:06,770
wouldn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Rosen so so</font>

1147
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:11,060
that's a comment to change the text to

1148
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:12,590
say that it's too late but we should

1149
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:17,930
have probably done that with additional

1150
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:20,690
data and having said that its

1151
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:23,020
specification required from a recognized

1152
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:25,760
standards organization

1153
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:28,069
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we actually have an out on</font>

1154
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,809
that though<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1155
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:32,720
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> register a mime type but you</font>

1156
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:44,950
also need expert review for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IANA</font>

1157
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:48,770
registry ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks Randy so</font>

1158
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:59,299
we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to what we talked</font>

1159
00:55:48,770 --> 00:56:03,109
about originally which was basically the

1160
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:04,790
document status so we have we have no

1161
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,980
individual drafts hanging out there

1162
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:10,099
targeted at egret right so nobody has

1163
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:13,220
submitted anything for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> while we have</font>

1164
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:15,710
these five drafts that are on the screen

1165
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:18,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there three of them we called</font>

1168
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:26,390
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we're getting to the point</font>

1169
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:28,609
where our work is winding down and when

1170
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:33,680
we submitted the request<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

1171
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:36,410
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> at IETF 96 there was 25 meeting</font>

1172
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,180
requests more than they had space for so

1173
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:41,058
my point I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to is we're almost</font>

1174
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:42,890
if we don't start wrapping up some of

1175
00:56:41,059 --> 00:56:44,630
this and winding down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keep asking</font>

1176
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:47,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">for meeting slots we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

1177
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the IETF a disservice by you</font>

1178
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:51,349
taking a meeting so awkward and there's

1179
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:55,459
a work group that really does need to

1180
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:58,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">meet so I'm couraging people to review</font>

1181
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,740
the working group last call documents so

1182
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:03,920
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have basically don't have to</font>

1183
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:06,979
meet you know in Seoul I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

1184
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,260
alyssa is going to you know overpower me

1185
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,609
in any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or form but we got to</font>

1186
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,950
get through these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that between</font>

1187
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:15,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car crash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and II call I think</font>

1188
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:18,160
those are not insurmountable issues I

1189
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:20,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">think if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we pay attention to those in</font>

1190
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:24,200
work through it we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1191
00:57:20,329 --> 00:57:26,089
documents done prior to to Seoul so I

1192
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,058
mean that's that's from a chair position

1193
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:31,880
that's what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like people to to</font>

1194
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:33,829
start working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on um Brian Rosen I I mean</font>

1195
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,920
I certainly agree with with what you

1196
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:36,900
said

1197
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,309
we put November down for you put

1198
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,950
November down and I'm hopeful that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1199
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:42,690
can meet that um but I think we had

1200
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:45,089
November a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago on it yes i</font>

1201
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,530
understand it depends on reviews it

1202
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:48,180
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on reviews i'm going to work</font>

1203
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:51,720
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get reviews so that we can do</font>

1204
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:54,629
those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i do believe that we</font>

1205
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:56,879
that there is more work to do and that

1206
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:58,920
more work is a result of deployment

1207
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,710
experience that works<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're having I</font>

1208
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:06,059
know at least two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1209
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:07,589
do um so I you know they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done as</font>

1210
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:08,910
individual drafts we can do it you know

1211
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:10,740
we can leave the mailing list open I

1212
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:12,690
understand all those kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things but</font>

1213
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,950
I think it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> good I think it</font>

1214
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:18,030
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better to leave the working</font>

1215
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:19,470
group open for a while that's two to do

1216
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:21,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">these those additional pieces of work</font>

1217
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's like thanks for the warning</font>

1218
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:26,939
obviously what we have to view is

1219
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:30,780
submission for dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Graf's is what we</font>

1220
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:32,520
look at so i think i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would hope</font>

1221
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:36,750
that all of these documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> are with the</font>

1222
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:38,700
IHG before the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting of the only</font>

1223
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,930
the gating factor is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is small</font>

1224
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:42,390
group of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who need to review all</font>

1225
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:44,308
of them are the likely candidates to

1226
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:46,558
review all of them but that would be my

1227
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:47,609
expectation for this but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

1228
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,740
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this group is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1229
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:51,390
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overhead in keeping</font>

1230
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:55,049
the group open and keeping the mailing

1231
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:57,290
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just having it sit there if</font>

1232
00:58:55,049 --> 00:59:00,660
even if there's no work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while</font>

1233
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:02,730
there's no reason to close it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for</font>

1234
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:05,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">this particular topic it seems like</font>

1235
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:06,990
things might pop up now and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1236
00:59:05,369 --> 00:59:10,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun we don't we can</font>

1237
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:13,049
sort of be in dormant state and that

1238
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:15,029
doesn't cost us anything so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1239
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:17,940
that would be my recommendation is after

1240
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:20,040
we get through the rest of these that we

1241
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,599
go and go into dormant state and then

1242
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">people can always bring the list with</font>

1243
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,760
new things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they come up and if you</font>

1244
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:29,009
know a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes by or something and we</font>

1245
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,349
change our minds we can we can close the

1246
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:33,180
group or just keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list or we have a</font>

1247
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:34,920
lot of options sorry that's a nice

1248
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:36,720
addition I think my point was more

1249
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,730
around taking precious precious minute

1250
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,348
time our meeting time at them you know

1251
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:41,940
what the meetings for face-to-face you

1252
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:44,609
know when II when this should be done by

1253
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:46,770
them in general working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group who's all</font>

00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,509
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASG so yeah I don't want to be</font>

1262
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,730
that's the chairs piece for the people

01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:49,050
hard requirements or if we ever see

1278
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,870
requirements on a 3gpp well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

1279
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:54,720
point is just that we basically did this

1280
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:57,420
for that for the service being developed

1281
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:00,629
in 3gpp we wrote the draft here for that

1282
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:02,070
so it's just one service but I mean I

1283
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:03,600
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time but I'm assuming the</font>

1284
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:05,640
timing on that is like we basically know

1285
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,799
everything like if we resolve these last

1286
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,870
couple open issues we can go to a group

1287
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,270
last call and go to ITF last column that

1288
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:16,350
will be okay for a 3gpp is that correct

1289
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:18,060
I think so just one thing we have a

1290
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:19,860
meeting where we have a meeting next

1291
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:22,400
week and we have two more meetings one

1292
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:39,300
of which<font color="#CCCCCC"> clashes with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sole meeting</font>

1293
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:41,400
to get this done for release 14 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1294
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:43,290
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible that new new</font>

1295
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:52,410
requirements will still be popping up

1296
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:59,940
from 3gpp in<font color="#E5E5E5"> November well but still I</font>

1297
01:01:52,410 --> 01:02:07,040
mean you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak yeah</font>

1298
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:11,280
I think to work is gonna is already

1299
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:13,140
pretty stable as far as a 3d BB work is

1300
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,060
concerned obviously they reference and

1301
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:16,680
we have all this open<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues and I know</font>

1302
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:19,290
they have a meeting next week so they're

1303
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:24,569
gonna be they're gonna be but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1304
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:26,580
it's i said it's it's there no main

1305
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:28,140
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean we we found issues that</font>

1306
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:30,870
previous meeting but they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have those</font>

1307
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,490
have all been taken care of say things

1308
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:35,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much went much smoother than it</font>

1309
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:37,080
thought so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so but you you remember</font>

1310
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,400
the original idea we were going to run

1311
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,190
it through IETF last column before

1312
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">Alyssa hit the pub request button we're</font>

1313
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,670
going to check<font color="#CCCCCC"> practice see if there's</font>

1314
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything else we needed we hadn't</font>

1315
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:49,890
covered from 3gpp perspective so I mean

1316
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:51,720
we can still follow that but if you know

1317
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:53,400
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says we don't have to</font>

1318
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:57,770
deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any more than you know</font>

1319
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:59,730
please it please let<font color="#E5E5E5"> us know okay I</font>

1320
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:01,320
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we're quite that right now</font>

1321
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:03,960
but I guess we could also initiate as

1322
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:07,050
well right we could we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> VA's to ITF</font>

1323
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:08,700
decreed from free to be p.m. so we think

1324
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:11,010
this is good now so don't hold it

1325
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:14,189
anymore or if you're waiting one out

1326
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:18,030
since then uh sir communication and

1327
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:20,670
