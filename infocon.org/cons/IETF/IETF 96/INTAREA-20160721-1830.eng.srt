119
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:26,360
evolution program<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good I'm even</font>

120
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,770
seeing a couple of people whose hands

121
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:36,200

122
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:41,600
that's good um you inter full screen all

123
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:48,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the bottom all to keep going</font>

124
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:50,260
down down down down yeah but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

125
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">show because then it's a Pecha Kucha um</font>

126
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:58,100
so basically this is a you know this is

127
00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:00,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">an attempt to take an immovable object</font>

128
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,540
and hit it with an unstoppable force

129
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,990
it's hard to evolve the stock but the

130
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,969
stack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bolts anyway um is there any</font>

131
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that the IEP can help and are there</font>

132
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">gaps in work in the IETF where there</font>

133
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,790
could be sort of engineering fixes to

134
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,530
some of these problems so in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> date</font>

135
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,939
say that the stack<font color="#CCCCCC"> is hard to evolve</font>

136
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,920
mean there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> these many layers and you</font>

137
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,950
know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room may have</font>

138
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,900
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ipv4 to ipv6 transition I'm</font>

139
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,220
assuming everyone here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's</font>

140
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,699
probably some slides you can find on

141
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,110
that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't um and so some of</font>

142
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,340
this was driven<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of this</font>

143
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,810
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually sort of like you know</font>

144
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,040
various actors who have part

145
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,239
responsibility for different parts of

146
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,699
the stack sort of moving in different

147
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,200
directions we originally thought so this

148
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what the IEDs stock evolution program</font>

149
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,690
looks like is can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we help um since the</font>

150
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:51,080
program<font color="#CCCCCC"> was sort of rebooted in 2014 um</font>

151
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:53,120
we've done two workshops um two and a

152
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">half workshops semi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> marni oh and I ought</font>

153
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,550
see so we're kind of looking

154
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">i OT things and how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i OT things have to</font>

155
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,189
do with various layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stack</font>

156
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,979
because there's no program to look at

157
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:04,290
the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> iot thing um and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

158
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,600
boss spud Accord<font color="#CCCCCC"> Plus this morning that</font>

159
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,829
was a great deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun um and then</font>

160
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,839
there was a barbell<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun measurement that</font>

161
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:12,449
led to the measurement analysis for

162
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,920
protocols research group which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

163
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:15,149
proposed research group but since<font color="#CCCCCC"> I made</font>

164
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,310
these slides it's now a real actual

165
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">full-blown research group um so there's</font>

166
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,180
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot that we've we've done</font>

167
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,009
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really touches on int area so far</font>

168
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,680
there may be as we look at how sort of

169
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:30,180
things in transport interact with things

170
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,959
down at layer 2 because there's this

171
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,920
layer 3 and that obviously has some

172
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:40,128
interactions there watch this space um

173
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,540
there's three ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> participate</font>

174
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:44,610
basically we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open list stock Evo</font>

176
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,399
relatively quiet recently because most

177
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,449
the people who are paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention to</font>

231
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,319
mandatory for all the documents and the

232
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,120
outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a recommendation</font>

233
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,060
from the reviewers we will have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

234
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,709
two reviewers from the directory whether

235
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,050
the document is ready for going to let

236
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:38,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">go or not so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

237
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,640
the directory will be doing you the

238
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,430
second thing that we will be doing is to

239
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,250

and our impact or hassle relationship

242
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,150
with the internet area and if that is

243
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,370
the case to also provide a review and to

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,730
deadline that is set on on the request

287
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,850
and last light all this information

288
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,730
together with mods more detailed things

289
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,440
will be up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Internet era directory</font>

290
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,329
web page<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is been updated so the</font>

291
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,730
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there right now is</font>

292
00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:03,199
that yet updated but it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in</font>

293
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:06,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next few days thanks thanks Carlos</font>

294
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,849
so subscription<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad so the thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

295
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:09,140
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to harmonize like this</font>

296
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,369
Directorate with like lot of the other

297
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,049
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are happening if you look at</font>

298
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:13,668
sector this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it works so</font>

299
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:15,349
the chairs all get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the pool by</font>

300
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:17,030
default and they try to review like all

301
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,619
the documents going through and we

302
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:22,220
haven't been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that in the past but</font>

303
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:24,678
it kind of starts to make sense to do

304
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,630
this as a way of like one thing that's

305
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,870
not written down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but it's something</font>

306
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's like on our minds as ad is like</font>

307
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,479
succession planning right like so

308
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,679
there's one thing we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

309
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,360
is like we want to have a team of

310
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,740
talented

311
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,449
who are like able to go through

312
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,620
documents from other areas trying to

313
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,030
find touch points and everything that

314
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,449
makes our life easier when we had to

315
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:45,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">replace ourselves</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's one</font>

316
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,000
thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of not stated here but</font>

317
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,320
it's something you're not thinking

318
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,820
second thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

319
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,240
systematically review all the documents

320
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,980
and that cannot be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done without a larger</font>

321
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,410
cool so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a nice set of</font>

322
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,360
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are in there but it's not</font>

323
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,350
sufficient with a number of documents

324
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:05,919
going to idea plus call so it's kind of

325
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,240
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> opting in all the internet area</font>

326
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,040
motion group chairs whether you're free

327
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,590
to opt out if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to do it</font>

328
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,120
like we won't like it but if if you want

329
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,030
opt out or not do the reviews like I

330
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,189
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> come and talk to the ladies or the</font>

331
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:22,360
D the coordinators and we cannot be<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

332
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,980
on car listening individual so are you

333
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,240
expecting a certain number of reviewers

334
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,740
every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> letting perform the</font>

335
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,530
Directorate or do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any idea of</font>

336
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,820
you know what what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this won't be</font>

337
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,470
like a round-robin<font color="#E5E5E5"> list that's how the</font>

338
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,240
other directorates work so this like an

339
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,679
all the list of reviews in there so when

340
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,720
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rahman comes out the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

341
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,970
Angeles does it and it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

342
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,400
going to be 1 review a month out<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

343
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,820
like if we get the right set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

344
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:52,690
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks all right any other</font>

345
00:18:45,820 --> 00:19:24,520
questions Carlos<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you so next</font>

346
00:18:52,690 --> 00:19:26,169
is Tom yeah sorry about the teen Abrams

347
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,240
it's coming up if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start an</font>

348
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:30,730
intro<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i won't deal with a</font>

349
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,490
blue-screen enjoy my name is Tom Herbert

350
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:37,929
today I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about generic</font>

351
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:41,760
UDP encapsulation I think I presented in

352
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:44,770
in area before why we're here today were

353
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,340
planning on or I guess is it a working

354
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,980
group by them

355
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:52,779
yeah so so we did we live and we did

356
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:55,010
adopt the document the previous revision

357
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:56,570
you think the new a new revision and

358
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,870
editors<font color="#CCCCCC"> are companion document right</font>

359
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we need to get the so the global</font>

360
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,479
change on it exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

361
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference between three and four and</font>

362
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,039
then what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the companion document talk</font>

363
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:09,470
about I guess that's what great so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

364
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,260
be representing a loose young and some

365
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,630
Isaiah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-authors just a brief</font>

366
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:18,529
background on go it is a type of

367
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,690
encapsulation within UDP we are

368
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:23,799
explicitly designing it to be generic

369
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,789
and extensible and we have

370
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,549
virtualization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and non virtualization</font>

371
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:31,190
use cases originally this was in NV<font color="#E5E5E5"> 03</font>

372
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:33,770
we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move it to int area</font>

373
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:40,010
because very general protocol so it

374
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:42,110
seems more appropriate they're mixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> GU</font>

375
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:44,000
is very much like cheery in fact it's

376
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,570
essentially based on GRE so we use a

377
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,970
concept of flag fields and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one sense</font>

378
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,850
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of you as being a successor</font>

379
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:57,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">to GRE so we did find with GRE it was</font>

380
00:20:52,850 --> 00:21:00,139
kind of limiting extensibility so<font color="#E5E5E5"> GU was</font>

381
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:02,330
defined based on that principle to go

382
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:06,860
beyond GRE and allow extensibility but

383
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:09,260
with the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> model um quick overview of</font>

384
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,678
the features so as I mentioned goos very

385
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,360
much like GRE with flag fields we added

386
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">a header length so this does allow for</font>

387
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,639
variable length headers and also allows

388
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:22,730
middleboxes to parse over headers they

389
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,169
don't understand we have an IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol</font>

390
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,950
number so one significant difference

391
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:30,620
with between GRE & goo goo carries an IP

392
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol number sets the 8-bit normal</font>

393
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:36,199
protocol number we use UDP encapsulation

394
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,469
similar to how will<font color="#CCCCCC"> join GRE over UDP to</font>

395
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,620
facilitate CCMP we a concept of control

396
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:45,350
messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus data messages one</font>

397
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,510
important extension is security we have

398
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,799
an optional security field that allows

399
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:53,110
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the header itself and</font>

400
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,059
similarly we have checked some

401
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:59,199
fragmentation several basic extensions

402
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:00,700
that all cover in a moment we targeted

403
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,480
hardware friendliness and as I mentioned

404
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:07,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does support network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> virtualization</font>

405
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">also the back fact that we used IP</font>

406
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:11,408
protocol number is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an aberration we</font>

407
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,500
do intend<font color="#CCCCCC"> on using this for layer 2</font>

408
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:15,549
layer 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> n layer for encapsulation</font>

409
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:20,529
there's a separate project we're working

410
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:23,590
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the layer four component so this</font>

411
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:26,370
is the current format of goo version 0

412
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:30,189
it's actually simplified since the last

413
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:32,559
version that we had done taking feedback

414
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,779
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adrienne</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Farrell so it's a UDP</font>

415
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,389
header followed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> four byte goo header</font>

416
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:40,600
followed by fields and a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

417
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:42,939
section so the flags indicate which

418
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,219
fields are present just like GRE the

419
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:48,639
private data is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a section that</font>

420
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:51,519
is somewhat undefined in the sense that

421
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:53,500
it can be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for private data so an</font>

422
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,529
implementation or site could put in

423
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:00,059
their own information<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could put in</font>

424
00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:06,429
tlv s or flag information or other like

425
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:07,840
just good version<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is actually what i</font>

426
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:10,809
would consider kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> special case</font>

427
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,250
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> really came up with the IP and</font>

428
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:18,190
UDP discussions and we realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

429
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:22,000
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the format</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gu</font>

430
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:25,090
we could actually directly encode an IP

431
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,220
packet within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GU header and call it</font>

432
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:31,590
version 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this has the exact same</font>

433
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:34,059
semantics as ipv4 and ipv6 over UDP

434
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,699
however since it's compatible<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

435
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:38,740
good version<font color="#E5E5E5"> number this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a goob</font>

436
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,809
packet which essentially means we can

437
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:45,130
use the same port number for both direct

438
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:50,260
IP and normal Goo packets with a good

439
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:52,210
header so the changes in version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 which</font>

440
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,158
was the most recent change and they

441
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,159
pointed out we simplified it so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> move</font>

442
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the concept of an extension fields bit</font>

443
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,840
magic number the inner flow and

444
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">identifier is renamed flow entropy</font>

445
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,389
that's basically the UDP source port

446
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:11,049
used for ecmp purposes we did describe

447
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:12,879
the set of IP protocol numbers that are

448
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">innocence legal</font>

449
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,830
very few were actually excluded

450
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,669
hop-by-hop options in ipv6 for instance

451
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:23,350
and ipv6 extension headers are

452
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,910
discounted an ipv4 but for the most part

453
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:28,000
it doesn't seem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a reason to</font>

454
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:30,490
exclude any of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal IP protocols</font>

455
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,370
at this point we allow user-defined

456
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:35,620
control types we greatly expand at the

457
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:40,120
ayana considerations so there are

458
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:44,620
several values that we need to to define

459
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,850
iono numbers for the checksum and some

460
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,199
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things were deferred to the</font>

461
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,800
extensions draft which I'll talk about

462
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,630
in a moment and we expanded on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

463
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,669
Security section and also there's a

464
00:24:52,630 --> 00:25:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">public online advanced security and</font>

465
00:24:54,670 --> 00:25:03,870
extensions draft so that was the main

466
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:06,939
draft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we have a companion draft</font>

467
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:08,939
which is myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lucy and Fred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> templin</font>

468
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,870
contributed greatly to the fragmentation

469
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:15,520
part of it so this is consolidating what

470
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,250
we kind of consider the fundamental set

471
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,620
of goo extensions so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop you</font>

472
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,810
we also had the idea that we would need

473
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,510
extensions so we kind of derived a basic

474
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:27,040
set what appear to be the fundamental

475
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,730
core extensions that we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to have</font>

476
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:33,129
an in an encapsulation protocol and they

477
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:36,100
are checksum option fragmentation option

478
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:40,000
security and paler transforms and remote

479
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:43,179
checksum offload checksum option it's

480
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,640
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to UDP light except we</font>

481
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,590
always cover the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GU header which is</font>

482
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,010
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific with a header length and</font>

483
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:52,570
we allow some portion of the goop paler

484
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,270
to be covered the reason we have a

485
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,760
checksum in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GU header is this kind</font>

486
00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of resolves some tricky issues we got</font>

487
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,270
with the ipv6 checksum in particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

488
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:07,629
this will include a pseudo header so the

489
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:09,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is that we can use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GU checksum</font>

490
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,720
to include the pseudo header and that

491
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:16,840
allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not use the ipv6 checksum</font>

492
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,670
which can be it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be used</font>

493
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,860
accepting restrictions on not using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

494
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,600
or pretty complex as we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in G</font>

495
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,520
reviewed if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mpls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reading people</font>

496
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:29,179
nextly fragmentation

497
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,300
then this basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an idea from 44</font>

498
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:35,720
59<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ideas put fragmentation in the</font>

499
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,680
encapsulation layer Joe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Fred have</font>

500
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,720
obviously been talking about

501
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,080
fragmentation on the list a lot this is

502
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,760
part of the discussion the idea it's

503
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,070
pretty pretty straightforward it's much

504
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,650
like normal IP fragmentation we do get

505
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:51,889
to put a fairly large identifier in

506
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,900
which is obviously helpful and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

507
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about fragmentation</font>

508
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">encapsulation is actually very efficient</font>

509
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,930
we only have the outer IP how to

510
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:02,659
replicate it there's no inner IP header

511
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:05,930
that's replicated so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's IP header goo</font>

512
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:09,920
header and then basically the fragmented

513
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:12,620
packet security option as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

514
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">also is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very important this is a</font>

515
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:17,389
variable field to accommodate various

516
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,630
security protocols sorry now is defined

517
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:23,390
as a 64-bit 128 bitter 2056<font color="#E5E5E5"> fitch field</font>

518
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,790
it's opaque in the sense that in order

519
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:27,650
for security work obviously the

520
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,960
endpoints have to agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning</font>

521
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,340
of it and we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of examples</font>

522
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,930
of how this might be used simple

523
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:38,149
security cookies secure hash could use

524
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:41,300
other algorithms to whatever extent we

525
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:44,420
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> security payload transformation</font>

526
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:47,230
option is kind of related this is the

527
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,640
idea that we will want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypt</font>

528
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,920
payloads often maybe sometimes and

529
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,220
compress it so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the payload</font>

530
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,470
transfer transform option this tells

531
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:00,080
what the payload actually is so our

532
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:03,710
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition for this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls so</font>

533
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,169
this allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have GU dtls payload</font>

534
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:10,610
and the dtls obviously protects the

535
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:14,720
payload with fairly strong security it's

536
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:18,620
like remote checksum offload is an

537
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,890
optimization this is for Nick's network

538
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:24,739
interface cards that compute the TCP or

539
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:27,410
UDP checksum of packets however are not

540
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:30,110
capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking inside an</font>

541
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:31,460
encapsulation to do the computation so

542
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,879
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> found some tricks if you</font>

543
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:38,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn on the UDP checksum there are ways</font>

544
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,200
to derive the inner checksum if we know

545
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,789
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

546
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,889
so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the remote checksum all</font>

547
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:45,320
flight is to emulate sort of a checksum

548
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:46,850
offload but packet actually goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

549
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,860
receiver and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the receiver can deduce</font>

550
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,928
what the correct checksum is on the

551
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,490
basis that the outer UDP checksum was

552
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:55,070
correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's a really nice</font>

553
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:58,370
performance optimization and we see

554
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:02,360
pretty good results<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this so we kind</font>

555
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:04,518
of like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i guess the request</font>

556
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:08,330
for making on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interior is to adopt</font>

557
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:10,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">goo so apparently that has happened the</font>

558
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,809
goo extensions if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't read the</font>

559
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:14,059
draft I believe they're pretty

560
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:16,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">straightforward at this point please</font>

561
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:18,710
read those and we would also like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

562
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:22,279
adopt those kind of the companion

563
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:24,409
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks so the that's a</font>

564
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:27,980
reminder so we've already accepted to

565
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:30,980
inherit from many 03 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GUI and you</font>

566
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:33,169
heard what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the differences are from C</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3</font>

567
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,010
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 and there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the extensions document</font>

568
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:38,389
so i guess the next step would be to

569
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,429
request the adoption of the extensions

570
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:43,519
document on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list but how</font>

00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:57,889
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody have any question for Tom</font>

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:12,080
a general question after<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh Ross Callens</font>

575
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:14,139
talk talk at the plenary where and who

576
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,299
should be writing the document on which

577
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:21,529
encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use for what because we</font>

578
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:24,830
certainly have enough of them so you saw

579
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:26,570
my you so my question to at the plenary

580
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,158
right so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna like the irony</font>

581
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,809
that I'm presenting another UDP

582
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,610
encapsulation and I'm asking why we're

583
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:37,668
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many UDP encapsulations one way</font>

584
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:43,129
I would view this so obviously mpls in

585
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:47,210
UDP GRE and UDP are done the difference

586
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:50,780
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> GU is it could subsea retic Lee</font>

587
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:53,180
subsumes both of those and any other IP

588
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,100
so in some sense it's obviously an

589
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,660
ambitious goal and obviously won't

590
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,879
happen but this should be the last

591
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,880
encapsulation protocol we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have</font>

592
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,710
which as you as you heard from working

593
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:13,580
groups response<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's been the</font>

594
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:16,100
story for the last six<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay actually it</font>

595
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,149
is a serious question because it this is

596
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to be the last one we</font>

597
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:23,210
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough and some kind of</font>

598
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,190
guidance and architecture document about

599
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,530
which ones you ought to use where for

600
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,800
what what purpose would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably benefit</font>

601
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:32,930
people who don't follow the

602
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:38,870
encapsulation development to work here

603
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:41,750
in detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah siddhesh kristen side</font>

604
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:44,840
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> shared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the optimism that this will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

605
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:47,390
the last and and if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why</font>

606
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,870
a google XKCD standards and you'll

607
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:53,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably find something but I I do</font>

608
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,820
believe that like something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave</font>

609
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">did like is useful because we had like</font>

610
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,810
similar things with the v6 transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

611
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,389
software so we had like a SoftWIRE

612
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:06,020
behave like a bunch of things to do

613
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:09,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">before or v6 be 60 v 4v four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2v 6v6 to</font>

614
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:11,180
be four<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on and so I think it's</font>

615
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:14,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">like something that's important and if</font>

616
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:17,270
you can identify like the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

617
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,950
differences between like how who can be

618
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,480
used forces like something else like

619
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:24,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful for somebody to big</font>

620
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:28,880
poop<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good doggy thanks</font>

621
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you thank you very much so</font>

622
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,530
next in line is Rolf this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

623
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,570
pick to us about the the update<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

624
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:39,020
privacy considerations or for a pea pod

625
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:41,030
cast multicast right so I'm quickly

626
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,500
going to recap on where we coming from

627
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,120
so we did a couple of experiments one

628
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,720
here at the ITF and Yokohama if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if</font>

629
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,489
you remember and one on a fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font>

630
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,010
campus<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and what we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we record</font>

631
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:55,700
it all broadcast and multicast I'm

632
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,920
traffic and it turns out that there's a

633
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,750
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of personally identifiable</font>

634
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,460
information in those protocols and a lot

635
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these protocols don't come from from</font>

636
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,840
the IETF

637
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:08,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">um so the privacy problems we saw for</font>

638
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,110
example was host namings a lot of people

639
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">name their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> host after themselves which</font>

640
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,969
if that is broadcast obviously everybody

641
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,070
knows your name<font color="#E5E5E5"> and potentially your</font>

642
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:19,500
identity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is basically covered</font>

643
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:21,570
in in this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw earlier</font>

644
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,910
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chess presentation so this is</font>

645
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,980
basely done there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of users are</font>

646
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,350
persistent identifiers and that has big

647
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,390
implications on a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

648
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's thing done in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF or I Triple</font>

649
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">E where you talk about IP address</font>

650
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:37,290
randomization or mac address

651
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:38,669
randomization if you randomize your mac

652
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,740
address but you have a persistent

653
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:43,020
identifiers that is broadcast to

654
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,300
everybody on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the land why even bother</font>

655
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it completely destroys mac address</font>

656
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:50,190
randomization a couple of protocols do

657
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:53,070
this we observe protocol behavior and a

658
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:55,290
lot of protocols frequently broadcast

659
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,540
and frequently means like four times a

660
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,790
minute and that's a lot so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

661
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,730
be on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network for for a couple of</font>

662
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:06,480
seconds and we have seen everybody on

663
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:07,890
the land let's a lot of protocols out of

664
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,990
that broadcast and multicast so you can

665
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:12,240
correlate it and we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with a</font>

666
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:13,709
bunch of protocols and at our<font color="#CCCCCC"> University</font>

667
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,649
for example we could reconstruct the

668
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,540
social graph of students so even didn't

669
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:20,970
know who they were but who they share

670
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,139
data with just by looking at broadcast

671
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,850
and multicast data that was actually

672
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite interesting and we love</font>

673
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:29,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussions with lawyers I'm along the</font>

674
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">way and we looked at a couple of the app</font>

675
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">stats that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually using broadcast</font>

676
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,879
and multicast and very often<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

677
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,790
configurable when to use that feature of

00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,980
the application some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you can</font>

679
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,659
switch it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and off but you can</font>

680
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,420
reconfigure it i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to say</font>

681
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:47,370
configure<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like if</font>

you're a<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft windows user for</font>

683
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:51,810
example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can configure your wireless</font>

686
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,969
space and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows is behaving</font>

687
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:59,490
differently so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> responding to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ping anymore and things like that and we</font>

689
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:05,459
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that in those apps so the</font>

690
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem very often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is proprietary</font>

691
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,310
protocols sewn on IDF protocols and

692
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:13,680
because idea protocols are fine we

693
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,120
believe for three reasons so there's

694
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,440
people looking at these protocols that

695
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,480
have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say input</font>

696
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,310
like the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> Directorate they're</font>

697
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,109
being reviewed people design them

698
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,328
carefully a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have something</font>

699
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:25,770
to say about them and we have documents

700
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:29,250
that you will privacy for example this

701
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:32,009
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet the NSS d privacy we have RFC 70</font>

702
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,660
and 19 which goes with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the HTTP privacy</font>

703
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,040
and a bunch of others and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

704
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,109
operational support<font color="#E5E5E5"> and product so</font>

705
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,550
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of wireless access points</font>

706
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:41,310
for example where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can enable dhcp</font>

707
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:43,109
snooping which means the access point

708
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:45,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">will see that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP packet and not</font>

709
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:46,680
going to rebroadcast that packet on the

710
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,089
wireless interface because then you can

711
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a rogue DHCP server or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

712
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:51,630
like that so there's products that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

713
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,670
deal with these protocols and they can

714
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:56,250
because they're openly specified by the

715
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,450

716
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,369
culprit here but its proprietary

717
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:03,089
protocols because they receive none of

718
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:06,319
this no review no input no operational

719
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:09,060
support because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're largely unknown</font>

720
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:12,329
so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this document we have some</font>

721
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:14,670
protocol design guidance for these kind

722
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:16,260
of folks to avoid these privacy problems

723
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,760
that we have observed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in real</font>

724
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,960
operational networks when we did our

experiments for example by you<font color="#CCCCCC"> revealed</font>

730
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,930
at the ITF or other SDOs such as IP

731

address or mac address randomization

732
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,710
because it completely destroys all these

733
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,899
efforts so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> an app developer</font>

734
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,700
and you have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool broadcast feature</font>

735
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,470
you can completely destroy IP address

736
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,960
randomization you should be aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

737
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,220
this right you should go somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

738
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,390
look it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I shouldn't do</font>

747
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,540
while since experiment there's been

749
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:23,310
having added progressively but yes I

750
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be to to eventually</font>

00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,029
adopt<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document so we really want to</font>

00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,250
opinion is

754
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:36,040

like immediately and impact who it also

756
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,480
begs the question is we have some

757
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,120
documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the host lamb document</font>

758
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,090
which is lingering in this group maybe

00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it should progress so he could you speak</font>

760
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">louder because I respect when we have a</font>

related document on the hostname

762
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:55,779
considered harmful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that one</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">start to be taking a long time therefore</font>

765
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:04,330
no particular reasons so to grow a

766
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:09,220
specific question I'd support<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding</font>

767
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:12,610
adoption now be a good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we saw</font>

768
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:14,529
for the hostname draft we will send it

00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:20,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will request publication after the</font>

772
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:43,060
this to the list but we do see as before

773
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:46,450
support them now ice pops turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> nope we</font>

774
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:49,990
don't have anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time hi</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">v working group it's been around for</font>

780
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,980
quite a while its guidelines on adding

781
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:10,950
congestion notification to protocols

782
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:15,460
that encapsulate IP so the basic idea is

783
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:27,609
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide oh there's a pointer hope you</font>

784
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:32,430
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point yeah the basic idea</font>

785
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,430
is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a best con practice draft</font>

786
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:40,460
given that ACN was added to IP in 2001

787
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:42,430
but that changed the lower interface and

788
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,170
nothing was ever really written about

789
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:47,750
what protocols beneath IP should have to

790
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:50,869
do this is both the tunnels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lower</font>

791
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:53,210
layers it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not straightforward</font>

792
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:54,619
it's like most things about

793
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:57,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">encapsulation and reasonably just</font>

794
00:39:54,619 --> 00:40:02,000
straightforward but ecn has two problems

795
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:04,609
one that the lower layers are often not

796
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,240
in the ITF so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cross organization as</font>

797
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:11,440
I Triple E 3gpp and there are some that

798
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:15,169
across area in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF as listed there</font>

799
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:20,690
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other is that it's cross-layer</font>

800
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:23,480
in that there's a need as you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see on</font>

801
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:27,369
the next slide to send information both

802
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:29,599
down the stack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the stack and also</font>

803
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:30,950
some lower layers have very different

804
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,930
feedback structures to others<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

805
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,569
there's more written in the drop of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

806
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:38,750
to hear call forward and up or up and

807
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:41,240
forward depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on whether they've got</font>

808
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:47,869
their own way of marking ecn in their

809
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:49,879
outer header so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big problem is</font>

810
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:55,609
incremental deployment as the next slide

811
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:59,240
shows and this this compares ecn with

812
00:40:55,609 --> 00:41:00,950
diffserv or traffic class identifier

813
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,930
more generally because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sometimes</font>

814
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:07,879
called traffic class in weight it's

815
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:09,649
called a and<font color="#E5E5E5"> b 6 in fact and it with</font>

816
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,650
that you're sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> your requirements</font>

817
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:17,420
down the stack to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower layer or to</font>

the transport is capable of

understanding easy and down the stack

822
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:29,060
and then you're the lower layer is

823
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:33,020
sending possible congestion experienced

824
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,730

00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:10,790
it which is very small and has just<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

837
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,899
split out into another little draft

838
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:15,770
which you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see at the moment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

839
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:19,730
individual but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TS PWD chairs want to</font>

840
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:22,610
fast-track it to PS because it's

841
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:25,790
essentially it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was it was a section of</font>

842
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:29,030
text in this BCP that updated a number

843
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:31,220
of other proposed standards and so we've

844
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:35,110
taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out as a proposed standard so</font>

845
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:40,759
it all goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process smoothly</font>

846
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:44,060
and the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a very simple</font>

00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:52,640
tunneling of ecn and its scope was IP

849
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:54,530
and IP tunnels and it was unclear to

850

<font color="#E5E5E5">people some people guess that that meant</font>

00:42:54,530 --> 00:43:01,460
also IP and I pee where there's a shim

852
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:03,410
in between like you know Jerry or do

853
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,020
that has just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been talked about and</font>

854
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:07,129
others guess that it didn't mean that so

855
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,470
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought we'd better make it clear so</font>

856
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:12,800
this is just a minor update to say we do

857
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:16,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually include that and we've</font>

858
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,720
specified it as tightly coupled shim in

859
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:21,920
other words where the shim is added at

860
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:24,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outer so that it is</font>

861
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,300
effectively something where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font>

862
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's doing it can have in memory what</font>

863
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:32,830
was in the other header and what will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

864
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,830
in the new one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can compare the two</font>

865
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:39,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and just in case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and in fact I'd like</font>

866
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback from anyone that reviews this</font>

867
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:43,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this we've said that RC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6040</font>

868
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:47,509
should apply because we figure we're

869
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:49,430
talking about updating tumbling specs

870
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:53,870
that have been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many you know</font>

871
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:56,180
hundreds of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it may be</font>

872
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:57,500
infeasible to change implementations

873
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,259
because the way they've been structured

874
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,550
but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we could say must we'd</font>

875
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:07,500
rather say must

876
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:09,390
and to give a feel for the specs this is

877
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,330
going that this has in the updates

878
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,650
header it's all that list there<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6040</font>

879
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:19,799
itself because it's widening the scope

880
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:21,810
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jerry spec one I thought of</font>

881
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:28,640
since was envied GRE but I don't know

882
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:31,200
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the status of a is same from yeah</font>

883
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,609
well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of heard the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goo maybe</font>

884
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:38,580
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> overtake it or something I</font>

885
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:41,460

887
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:47,040
and envy GRE have the same status they

00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,400
were independent submission track<font color="#CCCCCC"> docs</font>

889
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:56,190
yep yeah it's just whether MV GRE is

890
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,600
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere I because I don't both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

891
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,470
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as I know neither</font>

893
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:07,169
work it all the work that's going on in

894
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">NV 03 is new and caps yep even though</font>

895
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,800

<font color="#E5E5E5">million cap yeah then carrying on down</font>

898
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:23,300
the list there's all the l2tp well the

899
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:25,680
version 2 in version 3 there's pptp and

900
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,560
then add it to the list of a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

901
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,390
protocols there are non ITF ones all the

902
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,750
GTP ones from the 3gpp GPRS tunneling

903
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:40,009
best and that's just stated which is

904
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:43,470
informational in the IETF so essentially

905
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:48,110
the idea of this is to specify

906
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:55,080
implementations as being modified by to

907
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:58,490
RFC 6040 support and this actually 60

908
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:01,080
base also lists a couple of good guys

909
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:04,020
who have already done this let's go and

910
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:08,759
janae oh thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much who already</font>

911
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:10,590
have specified this eric nam<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark you</font>

912
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">say standard strike it's not clear what</font>

913
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:14,700
Stardust those things will have yet but

914
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">envy or three strainer because i won't</font>

915
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:21,089
said in the headers

916
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,089
yeah it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intended status yeah</font>

917
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:33,310
okay right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so next steps we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

918
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:36,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">like someone to review both these if if</font>

919
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you feel you may get forced to review</font>

920
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,970
them you might want to pick the short

921
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:41,740
one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> two pages before you get</font>

922
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:49,720
forced to read the other one which is 29

923
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:52,689
pages but the the obviously be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font>

924
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,339
that some standards track is more

925
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:57,400
important but the other one is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

926
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:59,800
more generic so someone with a bit of an

927
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:05,740
architectural feel for all this would be

928
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful so yes reviews please for both</font>

929
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,879
and I've put up there the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

930
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,410
we're looking at for reviewability you

931
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,570
know the comprehensibility gaps for the

932
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,950
first one but the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> one it's more</font>

933
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:20,080
is the list complete is the main thing

934
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:23,980
because it's such a short one and that

935
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:26,049
point about can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make it a must for</font>

936
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:30,790
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6040 or do we have should it</font>

937
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:31,510
be assured but like that looked over so

938
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:34,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know whether there's any</font>

939
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:37,870
volunteers have you think volunteers in

940
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:40,570
this one group well you can call for

941
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:42,069
volunteers would probably encourage you

942
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:45,060
to do it on the mailing list because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

943
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:50,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're starting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time right</font>

944
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:56,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks thank you much bachelor</font>

945
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:59,080
grammatical<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cheers yeah</font>

946
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:03,030
thanks it's chris right so chris is

947
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:06,960
presenting on behalf of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ron he's gonna</font>

948
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:10,600
talk to us about a pink or eating or

949
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,190
yeah enhanced thing it is and seniors

950
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:19,029
we're running behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can probably do</font>

951
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in five minutes if i'm lucky so as</font>

952
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:25,210
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enhanced ping is an</font>

953
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:29,500
enhanced form of being or extended ping

954
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:31,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not one of the authors</font>

955
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,270
they couldn't make it so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving this</font>

956
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:38,160
presentation for them so the motivation

957
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:40,960
is that when operators deploy a router

958
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:45,910
there might be useful to be able to use

959
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:48,700
numbered v4 interfaces or private

960
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:52,629
address space for v4 or only a<font color="#E5E5E5"> link</font>

961
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:56,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">local address on the v6 interface but</font>

962
00:48:52,630 --> 00:49:00,430
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that you can't ping those</font>

963
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:01,990
interfaces from anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet</font>

964
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,970
and even in the case of like a numbered

965
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,779
ipv4 interfaces even from within your

966
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:10,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">own domain so eeping comes to the rescue</font>

967
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:13,510
here it's an application much like

968
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:17,430
traditional ping sends a probe message

969
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:21,010
waits for<font color="#CCCCCC"> reply what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different about</font>

970
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:23,020
extended ping is that you have two

971
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:25,960
interfaces that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to specify</font>

972
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,300
one is the destination interface that's

973
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the interface that the probe is going to</font>

974
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:33,010
be sent to and that will be an IP

975
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:35,850
address just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in normal ping and in</font>

976
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:38,380
addition you<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify a probed interface</font>

977
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:41,650
that's the interface whose status is

978
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,150
being queried<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're typically</font>

979
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:46,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">different from each other but they could</font>

980
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">also be the same and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of makes it</font>

981
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:52,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">normal ping v so that destination</font>

982
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,820
interface has to be a reachable IP

983
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,859
address just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in normal ping and</font>

984
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:02,230
then the probed interface will specify

985
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:03,760
with the interface name index or an

986
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:07,920
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> which may or may not be</font>

987
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:11,080
reachable this is what a user would see

988
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:14,200
executing the ping in this case they are

989
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:16,029
specifying the destination interface is

990
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,799
the last IP address there and then there

991
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:20,460
are specifying the probed interface with

992
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:24,300
some option and then they find out the

993
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:27,010
status of the probed interface itself

994
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:30,640
similarly here they use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> link local</font>

995
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:35,560
address so in terms of what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

996
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:37,990
do to ICMP to make this work we have we

997
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,690
create two new ICMP messages the

998
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:43,390
extended echo and the extended echo

999
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:47,170
reply the extended echo message

1000
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:51,460
is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a normal echo message</font>

1001
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:54,700
except it adds an IP extension header or

1002
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:57,430
IP extension rather ICMP extension that

1003
00:50:54,700 --> 00:51:00,430
identifies the probed interface and

1004
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:04,359
carries the destination interface in the

1005
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:07,058
usual place and the extended echo reply

1006
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:09,480
message very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the normal echo</font>

1007
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:13,390
reply except it's got additional codes

1008
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:17,950
for telling you the status<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the probed</font>

1009
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:20,460
interface and there's two versions

1010
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:22,750
posted one in version one at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

1011
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:26,380
some comments have been received from a

1012
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:28,720
mailing list in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular adding the</font>

1013
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:32,130
ability to identify an interface by MAC

1014
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:36,480
address various editorial comments and

1015
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:39,579
we'll be posting a new version after ITF

1016
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,490
and so eventually we'd like to do this

1017
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:46,359
to be considered for adoption at some

1018
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:49,149
point thanks thanks a lot quit so very

1019
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:51,750
mike is not the author but I guess

1020
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:54,519
you're willing to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions yes</font>

1021
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:57,819
jhene aiko<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have not read the draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sir</font>

1022
00:51:54,519 --> 00:52:00,490
but I have a question ah so when you

1023
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:04,000
didn't define interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assume for</font>

1024
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:07,959
example for ipv6 link-local you should

1025
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:11,890
specify it with zone index right correct

1026
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:15,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct in fact yes I i pointed out to</font>

1027
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:17,618
to the authors that link local addresses

1028
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:20,380
and mac addresses for that matter on

1029
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:24,339
VLAN tag interfaces might not be unique

1030
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:26,140
for a given router and the related

1031
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:29,799
question so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said you couldn't</font>

1032
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:32,740
identify the interface by IP address or

1033
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:34,720
name is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or and so basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if my</font>

1034
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:37,049
interface has more than one IP address

1035
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,029
can i specify interface and make address

1036
00:52:37,049 --> 00:52:41,680
both of them right now I think the

1037
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:44,019
semantics of that aren't really well

1038
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,788
defined in the draft but we would

1039
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:49,328
welcome i'm sure the authors would

1040
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:52,119
welcome that input<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i will i</font>

1041
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:56,430
will help transfer that to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks</font>

1042
00:52:52,119 --> 00:53:00,520
one last question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do anything we want</font>

1043
00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:03,220
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trinka I see quite a bit of</font>

similarity with in the Sun MP get for

1045
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:09,640

1046

packet to an IP address and querying the

1047
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:18,819
status of interfaces maybe some pictures

1048

1058
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:52,359
make sure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> author's receive that</font>

information thanks um thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very</font>

1060
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,660
much so again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors are not</font>

1061
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,570
present but we encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to send</font>

1062
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:01,330
comments on the list thanks a lot Chris

1063
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:02,770
so next topic Margaret's gonna talk to

1064
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">us about bandwidth aggregation for</font>

1065
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:09,160
network access a new topic and probably

1066
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:13,650
relevant for interior and very adult to

1067
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:17,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">also being next to the zoo I guess so um</font>

1068
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:19,810
for several<font color="#CCCCCC"> i TS now we had an informal</font>

1069
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,580
group meeting to discuss bandwidth

1070
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:25,720
aggregation for network access or what

1071
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:30,130
we call banana um the bananas scenario

1072
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:32,439
is a very strict subset of a site

1073
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:34,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming scenario it's a scenario</font>

1074
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you have multiple links to a home</font>

1075
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,860
or small office and they are provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1076
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:44,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same service provider which opens up</font>

1077
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:48,220
a possibility for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of picture</font>

1078
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:49,810
where you've got a host a in a homer or

1079
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:55,740
small office you've got a host be

1080
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:59,170
somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the internet and the cpe is</font>

1081
00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:02,500
used is connected to two different types

1082
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:05,350
of link in this case in this particular

1083
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:08,790
example an LTE link in a DSL link but

1084
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:11,130
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific to that and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

1085
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:14,490
have a concentrator in the operators

1086
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:16,410
network that also can combine those two

1087
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:20,040
links and in this case there are various

1088
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:21,660
options for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do things like a load</font>

1089
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:25,800
sharing across<font color="#E5E5E5"> those two links for</font>

1090
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:27,810
bandwidth aggregation and or failover if

1091
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,970
one of those links is down the traffic

1092
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:31,520
could use the other link there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

1093
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,959
people are doing work in this area

1094
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,880
throughout the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the broadband</font>

1095
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,290
forum is working on some architecture

1096
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,720
for this but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many operators</font>

1097
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:41,630
who are out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there already implementing</font>

1098
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,919
this in several different countries

1099
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:45,960
hundreds of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users of</font>

1100
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,270
proprietary solutions in this area and

1101
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,800
we've been getting a lot of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1102
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:52,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">together when we first got together</font>

1103
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,260
there were seven different proposals for

1104
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:56,730
doing this where we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seven</font>

1105
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,230
left and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk to you bout a little</font>

1106
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,610
bit about what happened and we're

1107
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:04,260
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to solve this</font>

1108
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:06,380
problem using IETF protocols there were

1109
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:10,520
at one<font color="#CCCCCC"> time as I said seven different</font>

1110
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:12,870
proposals at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point what's left as</font>

1111
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:16,110
internet-drafts that haven't expired are

1112
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">two MP TCP based proposals that are</font>

1113
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:20,580
going to be merged into one after this

1114
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,860
meeting I think the agreement was very

1115
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,720
close to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting but when they</font>

1119
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:37,589
proprietary proposal right now I'm going

1120
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,720
on the independent stream that's already

1121
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:41,730
been deployed to multiple hundreds of

perform provide the basis of a

standards-based proposal there were

1125
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:50,520
other proposals as well there was a

1126
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,960
mobile IP based proposal that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

1127
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,790
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was quite a bit of</font>

interest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but the spec seemed to</font>

1131
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:03,000
be updated and there were always<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a</font>

1132
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,040
list based proposal that was

1133
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,410
experimental and the authors were doing

1134
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:11,310
I'm mostly interested in doing a

1135
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:13,020
simulation and measurements and stuff on

1136
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:15,660
their simulation and there were some

1137
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:17,070
others some other proprietary choices

1138
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:20,180
out there that haven't been documented

them is the problem statement document

1143
00:57:26,249 --> 00:57:30,660
that tries to describe that scenario in

1144
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:31,859
a bit more detail and my document

1145
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,839
considerations for a bandwidth

1149
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:45,779
want to keep in mind if one we're

1150
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:46,650
choosing a solution for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1151
00:57:45,779 --> 00:57:49,799
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying to figure out</font>

1152
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:52,109
right now is where to put this work in

1153
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:54,869
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf for how much of it to take into</font>

1154
00:57:52,109 --> 00:57:57,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ITF but my considerations document</font>

1155
00:57:54,869 --> 00:58:00,059
right now brings<font color="#CCCCCC"> up his shoes like her</font>

1156
00:57:57,809 --> 00:58:02,009
flow versus per packet multiplexing

1157
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,660
right you can say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor clothes</font>

1158
00:58:02,009 --> 00:58:05,609
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> better suppose the answer you get</font>

1159
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,649
from everybody else you got to do / flow

1160
00:58:05,609 --> 00:58:09,390
load sharing except that from a home

1161
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,910
there might at any given time the only

1162
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:13,558
one or two or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> flows into a perf</font>

1163
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:16,799
low load sharing actually gets pretty

1164
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:20,279
poor results so people are doing per

1165
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:21,900
packet or like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MP TCP</font>

1166
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:24,749
they're not absolutely doing / flow they

1167
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:26,969
are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to to share the load</font>

1168
00:58:24,749 --> 00:58:31,680
of one flow across multiple connections

1169
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:35,069
um I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether UDP gets low</font>

1170
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:38,069
balanced or bypassed in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NPT CP case</font>

1171
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:39,779
it's easy to do TCP UDP has to go a

1172
00:58:38,069 --> 00:58:44,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">different route some people are just</font>

1173
00:58:39,779 --> 00:58:46,920
using MP<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp and bypassing UDP ah that</font>

1174
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:49,589
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be okay if the amount of UDP</font>

1175
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:52,319
traffic stays low but if quick continues

1176
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:54,538
to run on UDP and becomes popular maybe

1177
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:58,199
that won't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I talk about those</font>

1178
00:58:54,539 --> 00:59:00,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">things in the draft and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together the TCP</font>

1180
00:59:00,209 --> 00:59:05,339
terminating the TCP connection musical

1181
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:07,410
like three slides left MTU and

1184
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:14,729
different trade-offs I think this pretty

strong agreement in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the group that's the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the next steps and what common work we</font>

1198
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:44,250
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF and then decide whether we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">can bring the work to the interior</font>

working group possibly or or to another

1201
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:52,350
group and that's basically why I'm here

1202
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:54,300
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to people about the</font>

a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of objection to that in the npp CP</font>

1212
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,180
group saying it was really more of an

1213
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:20,430
interior problem so should we be doing

1214
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:25,350
this kind of work and if so where and

1215
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:29,490
how here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it area somewhere else they</font>

may have any opinions about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for questions in general if you have a</font>

otherwise we encourage you to assist

01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,220
tonight to this barb off<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also</font>

1221
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:44,340
attempted to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we did send</font>

1222
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:47,609
information to the list about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> barb</font>

1223
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">off so anyone needs any more information</font>

1224
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:52,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the barb off you can find me at</font>

1225
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:55,350
the end thank you very much so we have

1226
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,870
11 slider from from Charlie that we're

1227
01:00:55,350 --> 01:01:00,360
out of time but if Charlie's here and

1228
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:02,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">willing to present maybe he can just</font>

1229
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:11,460
provide this and if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hear</font>

1230
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:13,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">Charlie okay so we're at a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time so I</font>

1231
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:15,780
can't present is that right yeah see a

1232
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:24,390
sudden it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay once like pretty much</font>

1233
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:26,960
info<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hold on well this will be very</font>

1234
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:32,100
short all those about not very short so

1235
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:37,770
next slide please yes so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

1236
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:40,350
draft about more or<font color="#E5E5E5"> less below layer</font>

1237
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:42,930
three characteristics of wireless links

1238
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:45,560
and we've had the draft out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1239
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:48,538
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten some comments it and</font>

1240
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:50,699
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> as earlier this week</font>

1241
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:52,319
I responded to all the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1242
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:54,449
were on the list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put out a new</font>

1243
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:56,669
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft which I pretty much</font>

1244
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:59,160
don't reckon too many people at a time

1245
01:01:56,669 --> 01:02:02,400
to read but please if you are interested

1246
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:05,848
take a look it's quite short so we

1247
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,400
included more citations for the kinds of

1248
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:11,749
protocols that could be affected by this

1249
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:14,849
for instance of ad hoc routing protocols

1250
01:02:11,749 --> 01:02:17,098
Alex asked a question about whether we

1251
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:19,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">intended to be talking about layer to</font>

1252
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hobbs her layer three hubs well really</font>

1253
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:26,669
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about what kind of affects</font>

1254
01:02:23,789 --> 01:02:29,130
their our own links between neighboring

1255
01:02:26,669 --> 01:02:31,979
devices but really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in sort of in</font>

1256
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:34,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">the context of layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ups it was a</font>

1257
01:02:31,979 --> 01:02:36,749
suggestion to reduce the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1258
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:40,439
informal nature of some of the

1259
01:02:36,749 --> 01:02:43,140
discussion so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was done the triggers</font>

1260
01:02:40,439 --> 01:02:46,769
were redrawn better captions and then

1261
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:49,859
some wordsmithing so all in all I think

1262
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:52,799
that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a relatively incremental</font>

1263
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:57,719
except maybe the next slide please other

1264
01:02:52,799 --> 01:03:02,509
words a suggestion for making in this

1265
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:05,819
draft a<font color="#E5E5E5"> discrete discussion about how to</font>

1266
01:03:02,509 --> 01:03:08,179
determine the quality of a link and link

1267
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:12,719
quality indicators is a non-trivial

1268
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:15,089
subject it's no just I guess you would

1269
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:17,069
say it's related to metrics over a link

1270
01:03:15,089 --> 01:03:18,749
and there's all kind of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1271
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:22,259
measure and whether it's bi-directional

1272
01:03:18,749 --> 01:03:25,828
or useful or what thresholds her are and

1273
01:03:22,259 --> 01:03:28,859
so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think that it does</font>

1274
01:03:25,829 --> 01:03:30,779
deserve discussion but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it</font>

1275
01:03:28,859 --> 01:03:33,719
belongs in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this draft and it would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1276
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:35,819
whole new area for discussion so I think

1277
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:38,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my last slide yep thank you very</font>

1278
01:03:35,819 --> 01:03:41,299
much Charlie so any quick feedback on

1279
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:43,439
this last couple of slides to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charlie</font>

1280
01:03:41,299 --> 01:03:45,479
otherwise probably we should take this

1281
01:03:43,439 --> 01:03:48,390
