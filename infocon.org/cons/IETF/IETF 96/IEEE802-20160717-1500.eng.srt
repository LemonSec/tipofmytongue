1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:20,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right they may show up with a</font>

2
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:28,720
you don't have the thing to attach it

3
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:34,780
you don't have the adapter okay okay

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:38,989
okay it's not animated I've got your

5
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,850
I've also got this loads in PDF you just

6
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:45,890
present from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the PDF i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna love ya</font>

7
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:52,340
nomination so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could just pull it</font>

8
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:54,830
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the email yeah it doesn't</font>

9
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:59,600
matter yeah it doesn't matter oh I don't

10
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">care about that it's just I'm just</font>

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,090
thinking which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is faster for the</font>

12
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:11,180
changeover okay all right and all right

13
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:15,460
it's 301 I guess we will go ahead and

14
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:19,130
get started um so this is a tutorial

15
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:22,309
covering two topics of emerging work in

16
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:25,908
I Tripoli 802 so I'll do the first part

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:29,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then switch over to Juan Carlos for</font>

18
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:30,830
the second part<font color="#E5E5E5"> um we're gonna the two</font>

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,090
topics we're covering our local address

20
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:42,860
use and privacy and usual disclaimers

21
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:51,040
about that none of us speaks for I

22
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:54,408
Tripoli 802 so these are our opinions ok

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,680
so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about the I</font>

24
00:01:54,409 --> 00:02:03,380
Triple E 80 to work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac addressing</font>

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,960
and that's providing some structure to

26
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the local address space and providing</font>

27
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,939
for our address<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution I'm Pat</font>

28
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:16,519
Thaler chair of the data center bridging

29
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:19,069
test group which also handles the

30
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:21,379
addressing work

31
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:25,339
and a distinguished engineer at broadcom

32
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:27,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm also i triple e</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 802 vice chair but i</font>

33
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:32,719
didn't put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on here because it's not</font>

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,239
as relevant to this topic um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

35
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">where this presentation is going to give</font>

36
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,239
you an<font color="#CCCCCC"> overview of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tripoli 802 MAC</font>

37
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:51,349
addresses and why we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some work</font>

38
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:55,370
on on local mac addresses um so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple</font>

39
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:58,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">E 802 defines a universal addresses and</font>

40
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,760
local addresses so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Universal addresses</font>

41
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,948
are supposed to be globally unique these

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,870
at the the two types of addresses are

43
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:14,209
both 48 bits or 64 bits we have both

44
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:17,049
kinds to find I'd say the vast majority

45
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:24,049
of address is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in use today are</font>

46
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:27,919
from the universal address space by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

47
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:30,530
way in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're called global</font>

48
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,769
addresses so I might slip up and say

49
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:39,079
global addresses as well but but

50
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:43,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">universal addresses is is the more is</font>

51
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:46,159
the more usual term for them they<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:51,229
universal addresses have the UL bit set

53
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:54,198
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 and they're called an extended</font>

54
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:58,159
unique identifier that's a term that

55
00:03:54,199 --> 00:04:03,259
came along<font color="#CCCCCC"> later so but you'll hear eui</font>

56
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:07,668
48 or eui-64 depending on the length<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80</font>

57
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:12,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">to 16 uses eui-64 and there are some</font>

58
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:15,590
uses of eui-64 as global identifier for

59
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,969
products that aren't where it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

60
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:22,909
mac address where it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a product</font>

61
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:25,820
identifier the other actively 802

62
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:30,710
standards primarily use 48-bit

63
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:32,510
addressing um local addresses bits have

64
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,080
the you UL bit

65
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:38,539
21 and up till now they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had any</font>

66
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:45,919
of any other defined structure it's just

67
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:51,040
a flat a flat 46 bit address space plus

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:58,430
the lope<font color="#CCCCCC"> universal local and individual</font>

69
00:04:51,040 --> 00:05:01,940
group a dress fits um<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're the</font>

70
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,880
universal addresses are handed out in

71
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,680
blocks by the I Triple E Registration

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:13,010
Authority there's three sizes of blocks

73
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:18,590
and with the most common being the two

74
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:21,860
to the 24th address block so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're the</font>

75
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,049
first 24 bits of the address are defined

76
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">by the value you're given by I Tripoli</font>

77
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:30,080
that value is called a<font color="#CCCCCC"> no you I and an</font>

78
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,040
organizational unique identifier and has

79
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:40,340
some other uses as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as address</font>

80
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:42,800
blocks and and the other two sizes are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

81
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,520
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20th addresses and 2 to the 12th</font>

82
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses just just so that if somebody</font>

83
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,859
only needs a smaller amount of addresses

84
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,450
the we don't consume all the address the

85
00:05:51,860 --> 00:06:00,950
full block of address space to give them

86
00:05:53,450 --> 00:06:03,979
some addresses um so the the let's say

87
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:06,170
the I Triple E assigned bits include the

88
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:11,750
universal local bit and the individual

89
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:14,690
group bit so the objective is to have

90
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:21,740
this address space space last at least a

91
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:25,340
hundred years so mac address consumption

92
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,220
has been ramping up over over time when

93
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,070
mac addresses were created<font color="#E5E5E5"> first created</font>

94
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:37,730
a company might get an address block and

95
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:45,349
and use it for years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years as as we</font>

96
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:48,050
started approaching the sec is this 2000

97
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:51,770
mac address usage was on pace to last

98
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,690
for centuries but then we started

99
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting addresses and things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

100
00:06:53,690 --> 00:07:01,900
and end in<font color="#E5E5E5"> TVs and in blu-ray players</font>

101
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:08,000
and all those other fun things printers

102
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:09,679
and in some cases there's multiple

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,610
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they have multiple</font>

104
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,330
ports and so that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> picked up the</font>

105
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:21,980
pace but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> still so at that rate of</font>

106
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:24,740
usage it still<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks on pace to last for</font>

107
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:29,690
a hundred years so that that was a big

108
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:32,450
uptick in usage but not but not anything

109
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:36,740
worse worrisome now we are starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

110
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:40,490
put network ports on things on<font color="#CCCCCC"> central</font>

111
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:43,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensors and actuators we've got LED</font>

112
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:48,020
lights<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are getting power and</font>

113
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,890
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ethernet cable they use</font>

114
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:56,349
power over ethernet which can provide

115
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:59,650
enough power to to run an LED light and

116
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:04,310
and some sensors and things as well as

117
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:06,650
the network and some of these things are

118
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,600
even disposable or short-lived devices

119
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">so there's some medical sensors for</font>

120
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,610
instance and some things are virtual you

121
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:19,880
know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of virtual machines</font>

122
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:21,770
that want mac addresses um so when we

123
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,630
start using mac addresses at that rate

124
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:29,870
we can't do a global<font color="#CCCCCC"> MAC address for</font>

125
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,760
every one of those things a it would run

126
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address space too quickly</font>

127
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,049
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be it's it's a manufacturing</font>

128
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,679
headache to have to give each one a

129
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:44,359
unique a unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and make sure</font>

130
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:47,329
mistakes aren't made in um so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

131
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,510
enable using local addresses without

132
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,430
having users or administrators have to

133
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,670
configure an address in each device when

134
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:59,120
they get it and the solution seems to be

135
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,550
to locate to enable local addresses

136
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:07,130
that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used without configuring</font>

137
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:12,439
them so in order to do that we want to

138
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:14,300
have some structure to the at the local

139
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:20,839
address space right now it's a big flat

140
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:23,410
space um and basically the only usage of

141
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,020
it right now as a local administrator

142
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:36,500
assigns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses from it as they</font>

143
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:39,680
wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the first project I'm going</font>

144
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:46,430
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is I Triple E 80 to see on</font>

145
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:52,219
local address usage um and the purpose

146
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:54,859
of a 0 to see is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Tripoli 802 is the</font>

147
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,710
standard that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of gives the overall</font>

148
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,529
architecture for the itrip<font color="#E5E5E5"> Leo do family</font>

149
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:04,400
of standards and so that's the document

150
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:08,000
this is going into it provides an

151
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,400
optional structure for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> use of the</font>

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,490
local address space since since the

153
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,490
advil address space has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for</font>

154
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:23,990
four decades now we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel we can</font>

155
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,970
say here's the way that everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

156
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the local address space and we're</font>

157
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:32,990
going to obsolete all the previous usage

158
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:34,310
of it and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other usages of it</font>

159
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,010
going around even though it's not

160
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:41,300
heavily used right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so this will</font>

161
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:44,089
go in as an optional structure to use in

162
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,839
a network for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local address space in</font>

163
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:52,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Network and part of the objective</font>

164
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,890
is to allow for coexistence of various

165
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,080
address assignment protocols so so some

166
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,000
people are likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you might use a</font>

167
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,070
generic kind of address assignment

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,130
protocol but there's also cases where

169
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,440
people want want to do a specific

170
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">address assignment protocol for their</font>

171
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">related to something else they're doing</font>

172
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,010
so we want to allow for there to be

173
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:18,350
multiple local address

174
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:20,030
uh assignment protocols um so this is

175
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">called us I'm not crazy about this</font>

176
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,860
acronym<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this this might get changed</font>

177
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,850
if somebody can come up with a better

178
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:33,920
acronym but it's called the structured

179
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:35,960
local address plan and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently at</font>

180
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,630
first working group ballots<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

181
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,600
currently going out for kind of the

182
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:45,800
first broader review in the working

183
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,460
group so this normally is a stage that

184
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">produces lots of comment and the details</font>

185
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:58,220
may change so basically right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

186
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:05,180
defines divides the address space into

187
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:08,050
four quadrants one is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standards</font>

188
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:12,530
assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier so that's a space</font>

189
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:17,050
for in which will<font color="#E5E5E5"> write I Triple E 80 to</font>

190
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:23,180
address assignment protocols to run in

191
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:25,670
and and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's an extended local</font>

192
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,439
identifier which is a space for

193
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,560
protocols that assign address is out of

194
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:36,260
a company ID block a company ID block is

195
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:40,060
something that any entity can get get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

196
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:45,860
block from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I Triple E for their use</font>

197
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:48,500
and so it's it's a it's a 24-bit

198
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,910
identifier like a no<font color="#E5E5E5"> UI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a 24-bit</font>

199
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:56,240
identifier but in this case the the

200
00:12:52,910 --> 00:13:01,640
local global bit is set to the local

201
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:05,140
value and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll also include in that</font>

202
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:08,930
some blocks for local administrator

203
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:11,120
assignment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's another</font>

204
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:15,349
block for administrative ly assigned

205
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifier and that quadrant can be used</font>

206
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:21,800
also for random address assignment so if

207
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,160
somebody wants random address assignment

208
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,630
too aware device just randomly picks it

209
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,939
an address and goes and uses

210
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:33,430
it if they want that to coexist with

211
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:36,200
some address assignment protocols um

212
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:42,979
that that has that quadrant and then

213
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:58,970
there's one quadrant that's reserved no

214
00:13:42,980 --> 00:14:07,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that one worked that's so that</font>

215
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:17,540
that would be um that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh 48</font>

216
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:23,390
bits minus minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> four so 44 bits yeah</font>

217
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:24,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">two to the 44 I know there were some</font>

218
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,920
people who are only interested in a

219
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,700
randomized assignment if they could get

220
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:34,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">40-46 but it's a pretty big space the</font>

221
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:37,640
other project is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E 802 CQ this</font>

222
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're in the very early phases of this</font>

223
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:45,170
project is multicast and local address

224
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:48,230
assignment and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to actually</font>

225
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,329
specify a protocol and procedure for

226
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,070
assignment of local add unique at

227
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:55,430
locally unique addresses so this would

228
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,440
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a kind of generic procedure</font>

229
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,439
that you could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of regardless of</font>

230
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:05,930
what protocols you're running on those

231
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:08,840
systems and it applies the assignment of

232
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:12,550
individual addresses and multicast group

233
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:16,340
addresses and it would provide for both

234
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:19,339
addresses for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for both address service</font>

235
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:23,210
providing addresses and appear to peer

236
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:25,400
protocol where somebody where<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a</font>

237
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:29,510
node tries to come to claim an address

238
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:33,290
and if there's a conflict detected gets

239
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:36,410
told that the conflict exists by the

240
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:40,310
piers and then tries a different address

241
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:43,219
so um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's two mechanisms for</font>

242
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:46,489
forgetting addresses that will cooperate

243
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:51,800
so you might a node might try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to claim</font>

244
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:53,420
an address and and get told hey i'm a

245
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,020
server on this network would you like me

246
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:59,839
to provide you as an address<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead and</font>

247
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,800
so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to keep those working</font>

248
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:08,900
together and right now we are soliciting

249
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:16,939
protocol proposals um I I wanted to say

250
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:18,800
this this also applies to multicast

251
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,730
addresses there are cases where

252
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:28,430
multicast addresses are used for for a

253
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:31,520
flow ID for for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> time sensitive</font>

254
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:38,000
networking flow for instance we've got I

255
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:41,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tripoli 1722 that specifies a audio and</font>

256
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,140
video flows and uses multicast addresses

257
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:48,860
and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a fairly lightweight</font>

258
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:52,069
version of a a an address society

259
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,760
distribution protocol in that and then

260
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:58,280
so they're interested in using this so

261
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,980
we added multicast group or group

262
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,860
addresses in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> individual</font>

263
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:08,170
addresses so that's basically the

264
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:12,380
outline of it it's pretty early<font color="#E5E5E5"> days I</font>

265
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,970
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to emphasize here that not</font>

266
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:19,459
every device should need a global MAC

267
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:22,360
address we need to enable the use of

268
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:28,810
local mac addresses and we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

269
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:31,850
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> that easier for people to do and</font>

270
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:34,190
so we don't want people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to assume that</font>

271
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:38,840
every individual MAC addresses in a UI

272
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:42,290
or that every device has any UI and then

273
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,939
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll hand it over to Juan Carlos</font>

274
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,178
and he'll give his presentation then

275
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:51,110
we'll take questions afterwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

276
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:53,570
actually I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present I'm going</font>

277
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run that from my computer just one</font>

278
00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:23,210
second here

279
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:31,969
okay yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want that other one</font>

280
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:44,140
open cuz you're there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> live a little</font>

281
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:47,360
just there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now you don't have the</font>

282
00:18:44,140 --> 00:19:13,630
the only sent that's the PDF one anyway

283
00:18:47,360 --> 00:19:13,629
ok ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok let's go real quick yep</font>

284
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:29,560
with the control<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you it's</font>

285
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:31,990
intricate so hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> Juan Carlos</font>

286
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,389
zuniga i'm going to present the second

287
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:37,000
part of the tutorial on emerging

288
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,750
technologies in 802 and my presentation

289
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,590
is around the privacy recommendation

290
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:48,640
project that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started in 802 actual in</font>

291
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:50,260
coordination with that with IETF so I am

292
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,660
here the culture of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet their</font>

293

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:41,830
don't want my data to be available and

310
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:43,900
he says he was probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> truth is</font>

311
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:46,389
we are connecting more and more things

312
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,270
people devices and information is

313
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:52,060
flowing all over so we have to do this

314
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,470
in a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> contient manner if we if we</font>

315
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,010
don't want to run into trouble in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

316
00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:00,250
future so the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind this project</font>

317
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,170
is specifically to to make people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware</font>

318
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:05,890
people that are designing that the

319
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:08,830
protocols of the the potential issues

320
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:13,110
that come can come up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future when</font>

321
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,110
information is no longer under control

322
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,990
so well that has already started talking

323
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">about data too but just a quick reminder</font>

324
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:26,230
for for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that are not</font>

325
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:28,240
familiar 802 is the group that is

326
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,760
working on the lower layers so you may

327
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,510
be familiar with Wi-Fi ethernet zigbee

328
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,540
blue too

329
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:37,300
with all those brandings came out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

330
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">travaglio two projects and they are</font>

331
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:45,580
usually assigning the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number so 11 3 15</font>

332
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:48,699
and so on these groups normally define

333
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,980
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 technologies we work</font>

334
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,260
together with IETF to define the rest of

335
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,690
the stack and then also with w3c to

336
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,210
define the application and upper part of

337
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,130
the of the stack these three

338
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,500
organizations work together<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only to</font>

339
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,420
define these protocols but also in the

340
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:09,940
in the privacy side we are coordinating

341
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:11,380
efforts so where everything started out

342
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,660
you'd say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy it's been</font>

343
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:18,460
discussed for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there was</font>

344
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:19,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">really a pig in 2013 after the of course</font>

345
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,040
there's northern revelations and

346
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:28,689
different issues that started happening

347
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:30,340
so I tfn IAB announced up the basically

348
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,860
had a formal position<font color="#E5E5E5"> against the</font>

349
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,040
privacy threat for pervasive

350
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,659
surveillance then we had a workshop

351
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,159
between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> three organization on</font>

352
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,290
strengthening the internet and we

353
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,580
discuss the different things that we

354
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,670
could do in each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

355
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations we created well there was</font>

356
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,320
already an executive coordination group

357
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:54,460
and between I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Triple E and I ETF and we</font>

358
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:58,419
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a topic coordinating privacy</font>

359
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:00,850
issues and this is from 2014 and we also

360
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:04,210
gave a tutorial to the I Triple later to

361
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:06,939
community on pervasive monitoring out of

362
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:11,200
that tutorial basically we created<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

363
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:14,040
group privacy in I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tripoli 802 coming</font>

364
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,770
back to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly we mean by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

365
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,540
we have to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font>

366
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,280
basically more philosophical if you will

367
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,040
but we have to focus on the individual

368
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,780
so by<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy we don't mean we are going</font>

369
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,030
to defend organizations we're not going

370
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,070
to defend infrastructure we're not going

371
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,710
to defend<font color="#CCCCCC"> a device we are going to</font>

372
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,139
defend the not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

373
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">device but individuals that can be</font>

374
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,700
surrounded by devices that may or<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

375
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,989
not belong to them so that that is

376
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep in mind</font>

377
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,430
it's it's all about the individual

378
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:51,820
then our discussion can very quickly

379
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:54,210
turn into a legal political or

380
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:58,570
philosophical discussion we have to keep

381
00:23:54,210 --> 00:24:00,490
technical so we define protocols in

382
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,559
these organizations we<font color="#CCCCCC"> define Internet</font>

383
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:05,530
protocols so we have to understand what

384
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,899
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the issues that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

385
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:11,190
attack and this is first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

386
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:14,370
identifying the privacy threats and then

387
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:18,250
meaty gaining those threads one by one

388
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:20,820
and then basically that way we don't get

389
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:25,240
into what is the reason of the threat

390
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:28,120
where it was a threat originated if it's

391
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:31,120
legal if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not legal we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

392
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,860
some legal frameworks or actually in

393
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,719
some countries for instance what is

394
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,270
legal in another country is completely

395
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,309
legal however the same device will

396
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,110
probably be shipped to both countries or

397
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:43,660
will trouble with the same individual to

398
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,469
both countries so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

399
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:49,510
into those discussions about legality or

400
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,980
political reasons for doing or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

401
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:53,290
just want to concentrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> on defending</font>

402
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:58,420
the threats regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the intention</font>

403
00:24:53,290 --> 00:25:00,460
of the attack by threats this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

404
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,400
subset but it gives you<font color="#CCCCCC"> an idea of what</font>

405
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean its identification correlation</font>

406
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,390
secondary use of the information

407
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,760
disclosure of this information excluding

408
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:12,460
the information surveillance so

409
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,700
monitoring individuals compromising the

410
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:21,790
store data the incursion and the means

411
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:24,010
attribution so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> oops I'm going to</font>

412
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,600
concentrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the first two in</font>

413
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:27,429
identification<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> correlation because</font>

414
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,639
those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones more relevant for I</font>

415
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:33,760
Tripoli a tattoo and for identification

416
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,800
we we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on this threat of</font>

417
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,530
tracking Wi-Fi mobile devices and you

418
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,110
might have heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were some</font>

419
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,990
issues were mac addresses of Wi-Fi

420
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:47,469
devices primarily from for mobile phones

421
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:49,510
were used to profile individuals without

422
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:52,270
their knowledge and there was this

423
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:55,480
famous use case in<font color="#CCCCCC"> London where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

424
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,100
waste bins were tracking past buyers and

425
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,530
then they were profiling

426
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,260
then because the trash bins were

427
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:05,049
correlating the information and from the

428
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,230
the path the<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking path of the user</font>

429
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:10,690
they could pretty much know what where

430
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user worked where he stopped to buy</font>

431
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,039
a coffee if it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the City of London</font>

432
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,280
most likely what kind of income he would

433
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,980
have what kind of age range so the

434
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:25,000
moment you know age income where you

435
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:27,160
work and you know where you live it's

436
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,440
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to find out who you are</font>

437
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,780
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though they claim</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't have a specific name</font>

00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:38,530
profile so that project actually got

441
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:40,780
stopped but that shows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how easy it</font>

442
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:44,320
is to basically build a system and start

443
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:47,918
tracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> people we know those systems</font>

444
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:53,830
exist today in different frameworks in

445
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:56,520
public places airports and so on the way

446
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:59,080
it works is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only as i mentioned core</font>

447
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,190
keep keeping track of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them address but</font>

448
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:05,199
also correlating with other metadata or

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:08,140
information from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user like</font>

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,679
the walking path where he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in</font>

451
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:14,919
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past in the case of Wi-Fi phones</font>

452
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,659
also broadcast the SSID s of networks

453
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,840
where it has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected in the past</font>

454
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:21,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you most likely have in the SSID in</font>

455
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,720
the clear the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your organization</font>

456
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:28,870
the company you work for or your home

457
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,539
etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we definitely don't</font>

458
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:35,439
want people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that a user is not</font>

459
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:38,710
at his home or that he has or work at a

460
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:43,950
place or he visited a coffee shop in the

461
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:46,750
past so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we do that is by</font>

462
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,870
identifying what are the PII is in the

466
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:59,889
known when we talk about credit cards

467
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:02,590
medical records IDs passports and so on

468
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,909
but when we start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

469
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,010
Internet of Things and all the new

470
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:08,620
technologies it's an interesting

471
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:11,049
question with a light bulb create a piii

472
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:13,268
with a microwave oven

473
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:15,399
a trash bin well if it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle</font>

00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:20,559
light bulb in the household in a small

476

room where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know next to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> baby and</font>

477
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,200
the baby the moment the baby is going to

478
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:29,649
sleep that always the light turns from

479
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,059
on to off always at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time we're</font>

480
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:32,709
revealing information if that type of

481
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:34,590
information is traveling on the internet

482
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,600
we have to be aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

483
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:40,840
misused and again it's not necessarily

484
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,699
to the owner of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

485
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,249
the device is used if someone is

486
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:48,070
monitoring a house and then they know

487
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:51,609
that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shower went on or that</font>

488
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:54,220
all the rooms of the house are are off

489
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:55,539
except for one that's information<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

491
00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:01,960
necessarily want to disclose so we are

492
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:06,700
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about applying the privacy by</font>

493
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:09,700
design principles and these are some

494
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:13,029
principles that have been discussed in

495
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,950
the past and are pretty generic but we

496
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:19,210
try to make them specific for our

497
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:22,149
protocols so one of the principles is we

498
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,850
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be proactive not reactive so</font>

499
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:27,609
basically we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to predict or as much</font>

500
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:29,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible try to attack or defend a</font>

501
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:31,809
threat before it takes place or it is

502
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:34,210
too late we want to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the privacy as</font>

503
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:37,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> default setting so we don't want users</font>

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:40,980
to become experts in configuring their

505
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:44,980
devices we want the devices to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

506
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,629
privacy enabled we also want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it</font>

507
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,359
embedded in the design we don't want to

508
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:52,779
be an add-on that you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

509
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,279
purchase to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be privacy enabled we want</font>

510
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:56,409
to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a positive sum so so we don't</font>

511
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:59,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to definitely the disrupt on the</font>

512
00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:01,539
business model of the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whoever</font>

513
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,559
is buying and selling that device for

00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:08,289
instance the<font color="#CCCCCC"> full life cycle protection</font>

515
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:09,789
so understanding the information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

516
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:11,289
generating by the device where it's

517
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:14,049
going to where it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be stored</font>

518
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it's going to be used so I'm not</font>

519
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:18,220
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopping at the device</font>

520
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,840
itself but also understanding that

521
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,600
indicates for I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tripoli arrow to for</font>

522
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,120
instance MAC addresses they travel and

523
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,669
they are used in

524
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,370
TF protocols so so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

525
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:31,980
what all the lifecycle protection of

526
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,600
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information we want to be</font>

527
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,910
transparent so make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all</font>

528
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,250
individuals understand that this is

529
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:40,170
happening or this could happen and if

530
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,460
ever they want to disclose their

531
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:43,950
information because that could be the

532
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,710
casing I don't know medical tracking

533
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:50,280
systems and so on the user may want to

534
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,840
decide to be tracked we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

535
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,810
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's transparent and the user</font>

536
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,860
is aware and again keep it user centric

537
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:01,110
so so it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user the</font>

538
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,270
mitigations that we can use and this is

539
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,820
pretty generic again so it's an 802 but

540
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:09,030
also 90th well first of all data

541
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:11,129
minimization so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need it you</font>

542
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:13,080
should not necessarily have it or

543
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,150
produce it so avoid as much as possible

544
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection the disclosure</font>

545
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:20,430
sensitivity and retention of pis make

546
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure again that privacy is the default</font>

547
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:24,860
in our protocol is not something that

548
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:27,060
it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> option that we have to turn on</font>

549
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,729
and we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that the user</font>

550
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,889
is allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> opt out or in this case</font>

551
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,990
could be opt-in you know if we come back

552
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:38,780
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question before us is the user</font>

553
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:38,780
though so you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be tracked</font>

554
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,650
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak quickly about a</font>

555
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:46,830
privacy experiment with it in the I

556
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:50,040
Triple E and I I Triple A two and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ETF</font>

557
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:53,520
networks when we created a set up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

558
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:56,580
to test the feasibility of randomizing

559
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,170
MAC addresses and that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> became</font>

560
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,090
that the permanent set up for both

561
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,710
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enabled now so</font>

562
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:05,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">people can can use freely MAC addresses</font>

563
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:10,980
without disrupting the network and in

564
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:15,540
both meetings so first of all as I've

565
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:18,210
already described a Wi-Fi 02 11 devices

566
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,920
exposure layer to address which we think

567
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:22,830
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> piii well it's actually a piii</font>

568
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:26,730
because it's globally unique and it it

569
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:29,129
can be used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify users in the way</font>

570
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:32,010
it happens for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that are not</font>

571
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,020
familiar is because for instance the

572
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:36,830
phone to connect more quickly they scan

573
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:39,470
actively for network so they they

574
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,960
continuously broadcast if the network is

575
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,419
available and by doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they</font>

576
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,519
disclosure and their and their identity

577
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:50,330
as well as a previous network that they

578
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:52,940
have connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some protocols in IETF</font>

579
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:56,720
make use of this information like ipv6

580
00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:00,230
address autoconfig to to create a layer

581
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 address so that is again propagating</font>

582
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:06,620
even beyond the the identifier the

583
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:09,260
unique identifier we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

584
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:12,709

586
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,950
moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> we we thought that not all the</font>

587
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,389
solutions of the problems now

588
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,480
fortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see more and more</font>

589
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:23,449
operating systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and devices that do</font>

590
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,850
support the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac address randomization so</font>

591
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly go through</font>

592
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,809
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you already heard from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Pat</font>

593
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:31,010
what what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> MAC addresses or how they</font>

594
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:35,000
are generated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

595
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:37,309
administered by my I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Triple E this is</font>

596
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,110
the structure so but already talked

597
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:43,789
about this there's a first<font color="#E5E5E5"> part that is</font>

598
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:45,590
assigned to<font color="#CCCCCC"> organ</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organization and then</font>

599
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:48,620
the second part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organization who</font>

600
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:51,500
uniquely assigns it to to a device so

601
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,899
what we did is we have a paper

602
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:58,190
describing the experiment but we created

603
00:33:53,899 --> 00:34:01,820
this small software to to run on<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux</font>

604
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:05,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows android and iOS to allow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

605
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:08,540
randomization of mac addresses and we

606
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,790
experiment how it would work and in

607
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,770
general there were simple rules like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

608
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,480
don't want to change your address in the

609
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:17,449
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> connection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to keep</font>

610
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,490
your address during the lifetime of the

611
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:22,399
connection not to disrupt the other

612
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:23,839
protocols but whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you disconnected</font>

613
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,149
from the network you would randomized

614
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,560
again in same thing when you were

615
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:29,569
scanning for networks and not

616
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,469
necessarily in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connected state we</font>

617
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:37,429
were able to randomize address every

618
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:40,339
every two minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think so we carried</font>

619
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:41,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">out the experiment that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF 91 first we</font>

620
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:43,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">created a separate network to make sure</font>

621
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:47,720
that we didn't disrupt the our own

622
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,610
network we saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was quite easy to</font>

623
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,589
to support just by<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweaking the D H</font>

624
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">cps ignition and not running out of</font>

625
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:58,200
addresses making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that we are</font>

626
00:34:54,449 --> 00:35:00,120
assigned a shorter lease the HCP list to

627
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,279
two mattresses that have the local bit

628
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,640
set so basically local addresses in this

629
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,860
case random addresses and then we were

630
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,990
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the same DHCP infrastructure</font>

631
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:13,350
for for both and that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

632
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:16,049
doing us of ITF 92 and in the plenary<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

633
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:23,040
triple 802 which actually happen here in

634
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:24,150
Berlin so interestingly we saw that even

635
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,330
though we were randomizing the MAC

636
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:29,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses there were some IP addresses</font>

637
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:31,710
that were still being assigned to this

638
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:34,100
to the same device despite the fact that

639
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:36,660
we were randomizing the mac address

640
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,180
after further investigation we realized

641
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:41,730
that the the DHCP binding was not only

642
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,879
taking place based on the mac address

643
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:49,230
but also on other identifiers like host

644
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,750
ID client ID and so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that rang the</font>

645
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,370
bell and we are doing some work now for

646
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">those of you that will attend a sag</font>

647
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:59,150
meeting or order the all the security

648
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:02,190
meetings and even in the in the six-man

649
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:05,550
we we are trying to to get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

650
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:07,890
these long-lived identifiers<font color="#CCCCCC"> sing our</font>

651
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:10,200
protocols because they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font>

652
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:13,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">bind still the information of the user</font>

653
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and track the user despite the fact that</font>

654
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:20,310
we are randomizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> MAC addresses or IP</font>

655
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:22,140
addresses so lesson learned we we cannot

656
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,930
work in isolation we have to make sure

657
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that privacy is fixed in all the</font>

658
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:30,660
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols and all the</font>

659
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:33,540
different parts of the stack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

660
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,490
was basically our conclusion as I

661
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,290
mentioned in this case well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the week</font>

662
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,390
is big into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning so if you hear</font>

663
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:42,120
you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier societies</font>

664
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:44,190
identify using the DHC group in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sag</font>

665
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:47,580
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mac addressing</font>

666
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:51,690
and another ways to get rid rid of this

667
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:53,190
identifier is definitely a up of all

668
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:57,300
these discussions and experiments that

669
00:36:53,190 --> 00:37:00,720
we have carried<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and the future work</font>

670
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:04,020
well again the IAB is doing some some

671
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,868
statements on and on the best use of the

672
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,910
product

673
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:11,029
we have specific work taking place in

674
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:15,500
different groups in the United later to

675
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:17,480
we created this I 802<font color="#CCCCCC"> II work that is</font>

676
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,390
defining the privacy threat model and

677
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,029
the and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommendations for I took</font>

678
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:25,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">later to users and that is in</font>

679
00:37:23,029 --> 00:37:27,559
coordination also with the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Pat</font>

680
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,169
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented data to see which will</font>

681
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:33,200
take care of defining a space as the

682
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:36,680
question was asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> before a space where</font>

683
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:40,549
we can randomize MAC addresses thank you

684
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:44,808
very much so I guess we still have a few

685
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:47,869
minutes right for Q&A and there we were

686
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:51,710
asked to to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that link to a survey</font>

687
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:54,230
monkey for you guys attending this

688
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:57,230
tutorial if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is all of us</font>

689
00:37:54,230 --> 00:38:00,680
or not that's helpful for the IETF

690
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:04,039
organizers they want to understand if

691
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,690
they if it's good to keep giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

692
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:09,289
tutorials about topics that are not

693
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:12,230
related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ETF or if there's ways to</font>

694
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:16,819
improve them<font color="#CCCCCC"> get better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess</font>

695
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:27,650
projects yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so are there any</font>

696
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:31,180
questions yes please<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to the mic you</font>

697
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,180
can check it that it's turned on please

698
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:44,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay can you please state</font>

699
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,250
your name first yes yes thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for</font>

700
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,130
the presentation both of you my name is

<font color="#E5E5E5">banners from Greece and policy fellow</font>

702
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:56,000
it's my first meeting here and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

703
00:38:51,770 --> 00:39:01,099
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you a question regarding the</font>

704
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:05,599
privacy that you said before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here</font>

705
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:08,059
you are producing the standards so these

706
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:13,460
tendencies<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be used in all</font>

707
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:15,710
over the world but the regulations about

privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not the same all over the</font>

710
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:26,530
world every friend in Europe in America

711
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:26,530
in AZ on Dance Crew so are either a

712
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:33,170
security measures from your side so

713
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:38,630
these standards that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you produce here</font>

714
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:41,599
about privacy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a would say adopted</font>

715
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:44,900
according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the regulations the policy</font>

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,270
regulation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> country have a blur</font>

717
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,540
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's country as I said has</font>

718
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:52,759
different legal environment that is my

719
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:57,319
question thank you very much thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

720
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:59,630
so the short answer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no because it's</font>

721
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:02,390
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult and as you say there are</font>

722
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,970
very different legal frameworks in the

723
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:09,740
world and often they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

724
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:12,950
contradictory so and you know that the

725
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,629
reasons for you know one country

726
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,669
tracking users may be completely

727
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">different to the reason for another</font>

728
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:22,460
country tracking users right and this

729
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:26,079
same standard has to be used in engaging

730
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:29,780
in Moscow in Washington and in Ottawa

731
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,700
Mexico City right so we know that

732
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,890
unfortunately that their reasons for

733
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:38,450
tracking users and then know those

734
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:41,629
places are very different and it easiest

735
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:43,578
is to not basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> take any any party</font>

736
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:45,410
just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well we're going to make</font>

737
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that this technology cannot be</font>

738
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:50,540
misused in the future and then we don't

739
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,930
we don't want to get into the argument

740
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,349
of

741
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:56,089
whether this is going to be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

742
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:58,550
government an organization by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal</font>

743
00:40:56,089 --> 00:41:01,730
organization by a commercial

00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:07,280
organization using privacy unfriendly

745
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:10,400
you know ways so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid all</font>

746
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,740
those legal political discussions and we

747
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,359
just want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it technical so so</font>

748
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,640
when you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about regulations you know</font>

749
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:19,250
complaint or regulation that that is

750
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">different because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be you know</font>

751
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:23,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">the in that that is when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> design the</font>

752
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,250
system sometimes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have like legal</font>

753
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:27,740
intercept type of things you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

754
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:30,440
are well known when you define for

755
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:33,939
instance cellular system you maybe have

756
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:38,329
to provide a hook to the to the

757
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:40,220
enforcement agencies to to to to track a

758
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,829
call for instance well that's part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

759
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,919
the whole system but at least we don't

760
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:48,349
leave a hole in which without

761
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,940
necessarily wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a user can be</font>

762
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:54,589
tracked by an external system right so

763
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:57,349
once you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system together you may</font>

764
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:59,420
run into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a regulatory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues but I don't</font>

765
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:03,079
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at the protocol level this is</font>

766
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:06,339
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to face or</font>

767
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:09,520
give their or give the individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

768
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:14,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">capacity let's say not to be tracked</font>

769
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:18,710
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a part of the protocol a Asuma</font>

770
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:21,619
yeah so again the protocol what we want

771
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:24,020
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid this is wasted to track people</font>

772
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:26,510
without necessarily the intention to do

773
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,579
it if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to enable the system to</font>

774
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:30,559
have a legal intercept feature well then

775
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:32,569
you define it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you make sure</font>

776
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,549
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's worked in a way that it's</font>

777
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:37,520
correctly used and for the purpose that

778
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:39,559
it was assigned for in a closed system

779
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,509
the problem here is that this our

780
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:43,339
internet technologies that are used left

781
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:46,130
and right and and you know that there

782
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:48,380
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several implementations that can be</font>

783
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:52,569
misused so that that that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

784
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,569
right this time thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very thank you</font>

785
00:42:53,230 --> 00:43:02,270
so if you're building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a client like a</font>

786
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:04,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile your name Lorenzo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quility if</font>

787
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:07,809
you're building<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

788
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:12,819
a client operating system you have to

789
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:15,160
weigh privacy against maybe other parts

790
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:16,660
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization or the team or</font>

791
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,788
whatever who are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimize</font>

792
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,980
connection time by reusing previously

793
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:24,789
used a tent fires doing things like DNA

794
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:26,440
and you're also trying to perhaps meet

795
00:43:24,789 --> 00:43:28,950
some entrance requirements that say you

796
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:34,420
must always be trackable on my network

797
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:35,980
is there some sort of place where we're

798
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,150
discussing those sorts of trade-offs

799
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,740
because at the end of the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist</font>

800
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't make it into implementations by</font>

801
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:43,328
default it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not gonna go</font>

802
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:45,490
anywhere and personally I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

803
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,900
see this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

804
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mobile operating systems</font>

805
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,059
to mac address randomization by default

806
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:54,520
all time but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> system level</font>

807
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:55,779
challenges that you you dodged right now

808
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,359
when you said you know when you build

809
00:43:55,779 --> 00:44:02,289
the system you have to deal with some of

810
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:03,430
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems but do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a place</font>

811
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:04,900
where we're discussing these problems

812
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,549
like do you have something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

813
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,140
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> my boss and says look here's all</font>

814
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:10,150
the scary things that we that will

815
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:13,839
happen to our users if we don't address

816
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:16,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">finder parameterisation for example so</font>

817
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:22,690
well there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I carry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two questions so to</font>

818
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:24,700
first the you are talking about the way

819
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,140
the way we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen in real</font>

820
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:29,740
commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems for instance and then</font>

821
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:31,990
that we did discuss solutions where we

822
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,939
can make profiles for instance we

823
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,990
understand that today's network for

824
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,359
instance when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you connect it to the</font>

825
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:39,069
hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might want to keep the same</font>

826
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,380
mac address when you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

827
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:43,538
hotel because otherwise if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pay for</font>

828
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:46,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the you know the Wi-Fi through the week</font>

829
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:48,010
they usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize you through the</font>

830
00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:49,990
mac address so you don't want to change

831
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> MAC address as long as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell the</font>

832
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:54,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">user well do you want to keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mac</font>

833
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,740
address for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this network then it's</font>

834
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:59,410
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to make a profile and then</font>

835
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,479
keep coming back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same mac address</font>

836
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is specific use case and and</font>

837
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,220
that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used also for connecting to</font>

838
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,240
an enterprise network where you are also

839
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,910
authenticated through through the sort

840
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of mac address and so on we had those</font>

841
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:14,980
discussions actually in the interior

842
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:17,560
before and christian christian with Emma

843
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,780
had a proposal would where<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

844
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:23,200
actually said that Windows 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

845
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:25,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">supported some sort of profiling it's</font>

846
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,299
not in the real of us to define that

847
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:32,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">profiling but that discussion did take</font>

848
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:35,530
place in at one point in time and even

849
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:37,030
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in the I think in our</font>

850
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:40,870
experimentation we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

851
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:42,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know ability to make profiles so I</font>

852
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:44,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think that there's a there's a</font>

853
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,500
forum where we we can talk about it

854
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:51,700
result in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a document that discussion in</font>

00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">an area that would there was a</font>

856
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,290
presentation and I think that there then

857
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,089
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> well Christian has a couple of</font>

860
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,810
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking about this</font>

861
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:07,150
this this one nation probably in the

862
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:09,970
introduction he does mention you know

863
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:12,310
the overall problematic but if i

864
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:18,939
remember well in interior it was only

865
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:22,930
slides that he percent yes I met<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barrow</font>

866
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:26,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">set my question is whether it may be too</font>

867
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:28,060
soon but if there's a way that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

868
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:30,820
generalize what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've discovered about</font>

trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring the possibility for</font>

870
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:37,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy into protocols that we're</font>

871
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:40,240
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on here or any any things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

872
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:43,210
you've observed that if you were going

873
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say if we started originally with</font>

874
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:52,030
this in mind we might have done it this

875
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:53,470
way but probably if I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

876
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:56,320
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> its it'll be around that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

877
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:58,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy by design</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> principles so I don't</font>

878
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,010
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were present</font>

879
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,010
in people's mind when when we started

880
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:04,240
working on these protocols and in

881
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:06,720
furthermore<font color="#E5E5E5"> these protocols where</font>

882
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,319
sometimes useful for local cable

883
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,109
connections and now they are

884
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:14,170
broadcasting information with radio in

885
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:15,910
the clear they were meant for computers

886
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:20,350
and now being<font color="#E5E5E5"> there being used in cell</font>

887
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:22,480
phones so so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if again if I</font>

888
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:24,069
understand your concern or your question

889
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,420
it it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be around the privacy by the</font>

890
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:27,700
sign that we did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have those</font>

891
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,590
principles in mind and we thought that

892
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a closed system that did not have any</font>

893
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,700
risks and all of a sudden though

894
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:37,390
became risks so we're trying to patch

895
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:41,140
the system now but ideally we don't want

896
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:43,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create more risks in the future yeah</font>

897
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:46,960
what I men in particular was I've read<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

898
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:53,049
number of privacy by design articles and

899
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:54,940
book how that applies to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the creation of</font>

900
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,820
protocols that we might do here at the

901
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,620
ITF is maybe a little less clear to me

902
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,540
generally speaking and I was just

903
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">curious if there were specific things</font>

904
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:06,790
like you mentioned the long-lasting

905
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:09,759
associations might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> counter-productive</font>

906
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:11,710
if we're if one of the goals is privacy

907
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,740
and it was that kind of more specific

908
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:17,230
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was curious about well that that</font>

909
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">long-lasting identifier says is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

910
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,190
quickly said but actually more and more

911
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:23,110
we discover that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they exist in more and</font>

912
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:26,110
more protocols so that is the current

913
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:28,990
discussion that we have people realizing

914
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:31,570
that now in<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> screen but oh by the</font>

915
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:34,060
way in layer 4 as well actually we would

916
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:36,730
use it now in layer 4 and then be on

917
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:38,980
application and so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that is</font>

918
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,930
one but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably in the future</font>

919
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:45,850
we will find out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's more than</font>

920
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:50,339
IDs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to work on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its my name</font>

923
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,500
on from<font color="#E5E5E5"> work from gist of what I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

924
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're protecting from the external</font>

925
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:02,770
threat how's the pasta in general the

926
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:07,360
thing and I still believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

927
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:08,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to for some sort of auditing and</font>

troubleshooting vision particular device

930
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:17,020
what you say not working properly with

931
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:18,610
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of techniques they've been</font>

932
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:21,520
discussing that's gonna become more and

933
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:25,270
more complicated so what provisions are

934
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:29,170
you thinking to maintain<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of</font>

935
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:34,380
auditing capability for whatever of

936
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:38,099
engineering or even for example were um

937
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,509
pricing<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs cafe thank you</font>

938
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:43,650
what does this question is usually don't

939
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:46,920
take place here of course I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> lying we</font>

940
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:50,519
can discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of them but but you know</font>

941
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:53,759
the commercial implications are only

942
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:55,109
considering to the point that if we talk

943
00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:58,259
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption for instance you may</font>

944
00:49:55,109 --> 00:50:00,299
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a more more processing</font>

945
00:49:58,259 --> 00:50:03,059
power in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and then that could</font>

946
00:50:00,299 --> 00:50:05,009
affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost and so on so we may want</font>

947
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:08,460
to consider that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when when choosing</font>

948
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:11,160
different type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> of encryption and when</font>

949
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,650
we talk about specifics like that but I

950
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,058
beyond that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think that this is</font>

951
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:18,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a discussion that normally takes</font>

952
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:22,470
place in this forum so it'll be more in

953
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:28,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">the I guess industry organizations who</font>

954
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:29,939
will decide on on those by the way

955
00:50:28,229 --> 00:50:33,089
encryption is as is the other word<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

956
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,890
the IAB keeps using encryption keep

957
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:39,808
using encryption don't send data on the

958
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:43,890
clear yes my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> dream I'm here</font>

959
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:46,349

960
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:48,930
question is not very much related to

961
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:50,759
policy i would say it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a carry</font>

962
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:53,038
out of curiosity out of the discussion

963
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:55,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">we had today can you get closer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mike</font>

00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a type I for you I maybe now same</font>

965
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,828
prob now yeah yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> right I've</font>

966
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:03,749
always thought but anyways um the the

967
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">question i'm raising is out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of curiosity</font>

968
00:51:03,749 --> 00:51:10,499
that I just drive from what you've been

969
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:15,299
discussing when you spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> about privacy</font>

970
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:19,799
by design and as a user how would a

971
00:51:15,299 --> 00:51:25,288
person make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that their privacy is</font>

972
00:51:19,799 --> 00:51:28,529
protected when they take the privacy box

973
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:30,839
basically and with the reason why I'm

974
00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:36,089
asking this question is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

975
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:39,739
buzz<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pokemon go game is going around I</font>

976
00:51:36,089 --> 00:51:42,299
was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who fenced oh</font>

977
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:45,390
downloaded the application the first day

978
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:48,719
the the game was launched but I was too

979
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:49,970
scared to use it after the the

980
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,900
controversial

981
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:55,770
discussions have been coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> out about</font>

982
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">how data is going to be used or may be</font>

983
00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:02,820
used in terms of tracking so um

984
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:07,950
guidelines in such a way might be

985
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:10,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">helpful if possible yeah I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

986
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:14,640
that falls more in the realm of w3c by

987
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:16,350
in the applications in our case when we

988
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,839
talk about the tick and unfortunately

989
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:20,850
today we have several texts right this

990
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,230
privacy for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> application privacy for</font>

991
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:26,220
your Wi-Fi privacy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this network</font>

992
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:27,900
privacy so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid the fact</font>

993
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,580
that you know users become experts and

994
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,320
they have to search all over the place

995
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:34,319
and tick tick tick tick tick<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to make</font>

996
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:38,100
sure it works you raise a good point

997
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:41,220
that you know what how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect</font>

00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the future applications popping up and</font>

then disrupting the whole the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

1000
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:49,710

1001
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,299
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain point we would like</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a correlation so that if the</font>

application be aware that you are

1007
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:03,629
against your own decisions in the past

1008

that that could be a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but</font>

1009
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:08,250
again that's pretty much an<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">layer w3c has something to working on</font>

1011
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:12,000
that with it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web browsers for</font>

1014
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:19,200
you do on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser where the browser</font>

1015
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:21,350
tells the website that came out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1016
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,689
discussions but still not enough

1017
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately yeah I I Tripoli 802 is</font>

1018
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:31,800
dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the layer to protocol and</font>

1019
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:35,490
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our objective is to avoid the your</font>

1020
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:39,240
device leaking data kind of to the world

1021
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:41,339
as you carry it around at layer 2 which

1022
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:45,509
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a totally different question than</font>

1023
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether um an application that's using</font>

1024
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:52,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">GPS and that you're logged into as a</font>

1025
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:58,589
user of that application are you willing

1026
00:53:52,860 --> 00:54:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to let that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know your GPS location</font>

1027
00:53:58,589 --> 00:54:07,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">hey what is my day don't see basically</font>

1028
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:10,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah yeah and I would say by the way</font>

1029
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:12,229
that's it's much less<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an issue with</font>

1030
00:54:10,259 --> 00:54:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pokemon go than it is with ingress</font>

1031
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:17,549
because ingress it puts out on comm

1032
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:29,999
where you were and somebody can see

1033
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:32,519
where I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> around on the ingress but</font>

1034
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:34,019
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's also not today's topic</font>

1035
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,729
because that's not a layer 2 thing

1036
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:40,769
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> application thing other</font>

1037
00:54:35,729 --> 00:54:43,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">insecurity again I would I would I would</font>

1038
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:44,660
like to like to put in an impassioned

1039
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:49,169
plea for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not ever say that</font>

1040
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:52,308
because now that we say sorry not to say

1041
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:55,289
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem is a bit above layer to</font>

1042
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:57,119
because but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends and therefore cannot be</font>

1043
00:54:55,289 --> 00:54:58,829
sold at layer 2 and the reason I say

1044
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,450
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think if we have strong</font>

1045
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:02,219
if we have strong security and privacy

1046
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:04,288
at the lower layers it becomes much

1047
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:07,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier to build a lot of the higher</font>

1048
00:55:04,289 --> 00:55:08,579
layers to rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because like one</font>

1049
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:10,650
discussion that we're having right now

1050
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:12,660
in the 6-pound working group is like we

1051
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:15,479
can't trust mac address randomization to

1052
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:18,089
be in place so we must randomized our

1053
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:19,439
own identifiers and if you look at it

1054
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a holistic point of view like if</font>

1055
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,619
you're building an operating system you

1056
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,359
say look that's a stupid thing to do

1057
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:26,219
because i have to randomize it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1058
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:27,989
different layers because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

1059
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:29,369
protect against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lower lay against</font>

1060
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:31,229
layer to threats because they're very

1061
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:33,119
dangerous and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i also want to protect</font>

1062
00:55:31,229 --> 00:55:34,828
against the layer 3 sets so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

1063
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,660
to implement randomization to places

1064
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:39,269
where as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can rely on their to</font>

1065
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:41,098
randomization its way stronger than

1066
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:43,019
doing it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their three right there's</font>

1067
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:44,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's a good reason why we don't</font>

1068
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:47,218
implement check sums in HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1069
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:49,019
it's done by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know and so it</font>

1070
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:52,229
would be nice if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could rely on this</font>

1071
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:54,569
stuff beings robust at layer 2 I agree

1072
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:58,759
and and I wasn't saying that we

1073
00:55:54,569 --> 00:56:01,380
shouldn't but um given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

1074
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:05,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">your your own device knows your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS</font>

1075
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:08,460
location if you if you no matter what we

1076
00:56:05,549 --> 00:56:11,430
do at layer 2 if you're logged into some

1077
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:12,570
system and sending them reports of your

1078
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:15,870
GPS

1079
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:18,480
location nothing we do at layer 2 it is

1080
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:21,630
going to undo the fact that that the

1081
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,160
system you're logged into I guess knows

1082
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:26,100
your physical location because you

1083
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,470
logged into it and are sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to it</font>

1084
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:30,420
but that that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there are</font>

1085
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:33,359
problems we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say is we can and should</font>

1086
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:36,090
solve it layer 2 and we shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1087
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,380
leaking information but I think they

1088
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,480
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three categories of problems and</font>

1089
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,130
stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't fix at all like a</font>

1090
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,600
GPS probably you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just mentioned i agree</font>

1091
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,890
hundred percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their stuff that</font>

1092
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,720
you can't fix hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1093
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:47,430
it's at little layer and i think that

1094
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,410
there's stuff that you can fix if you do

1095
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:53,310
a good job even in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the layers above you</font>

1096
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:55,140
like this case of IP address identifies

1097
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:57,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">identifiers in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the museum okay i would</font>

1098
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">encourage you try to to maybe think</font>

1099
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,380
about those a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit as well because</font>

1100
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:03,450
the solid lower layer security is always

1101
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:07,580
a better foundation of my in my mind

1102
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:10,200
then redoing it at the layer above sure

1103
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:13,140
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh good afternoon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my name is Gregory</font>

1104
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,960
I'm also public policy fitter and we've

1105
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:17,400
been talking a lot about privacy and

1106
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,840
there is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a similar concept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

1107
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,270
also equally very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for society</font>

1108
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:24,450
and this is anonymity and I was

1109
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:27,690
wondering whether ye are do you have a

1110
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:29,819
registrant on trying to protect

1111
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:35,480
anonymity as well or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1112
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:38,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't give way that oh I think</font>

1113
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,920
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we can't be included in</font>

1114
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,680
parts part of the privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> so definitely</font>

1115
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:47,330
if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep users anonymous then</font>

1116
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:50,970
that's a way of providing privacy

1117
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:52,140
there's different ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it we but</font>

1118
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,660
we don't I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think we necessarily</font>

1119
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:57,480
talk about the fact that anonymity

1120
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">because as we said sometimes we want to</font>

1121
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,600
turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on or off or tracking or not so</font>

1122
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">we want to be a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more specific</font>

1123
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:07,500
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but you know I think privacy</font>

1124
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,820
identifiable information<font color="#CCCCCC"> yan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> globes you</font>

1125
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:13,580
know the fact that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

1126
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:13,580
anonymous users that are not aware of

1127
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:32,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right so yeah writing to me</font>

1128
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:35,500
nice tool I think yes so just reminding

1129
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:39,190
you again that the edgy team likes

1130
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:41,230
feedback on on how people<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt about the</font>

1131
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:45,070
tutorial so there's the survey

1132
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:55,210
information there and thank you for your

1133
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:57,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention today Thanks look I was well</font>

1134
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:59,830
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a little worried they weren't</font>

1135
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,420
going to any questions thanks for doing

1136
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:03,730
I didn't get any about addressing<font color="#E5E5E5"> edit</font>

1137
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them well it's fun it's a more boring</font>

1138
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:28,320
topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that's part of it thanks for</font>

1139
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:28,319
discipline yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes you hey yes</font>

1140
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:43,300
yeah I see that alleviates so you're

1141
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:46,930
still gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good researchers you have</font>

1142
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:48,670
a streams and a critical so did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1143
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:53,850
addresses with something with the sign

1144
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:53,850
up that's a stinking drunk

1145
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:02,420
you
