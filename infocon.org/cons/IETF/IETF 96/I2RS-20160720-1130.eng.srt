7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,400
should really get about him working

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,560
group but my brain was called this

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:50,810

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:04,110
to be much more informal and discussion

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:08,700
oriented even monday um we're going to

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,429
look at version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 of the text to try to</font>

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,079
close it off because after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that oh just</font>

18
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:24,288
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people haven't ever seen a note</font>

19
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:28,439
well maybe he needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well um</font>

submission to the ITF as a contributor

22
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,729
you should read this and figure out your

23
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:45,089
rights the IPR and that's a note well

24
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a blue sheets the</font>

26
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:56,819
laid-back discussion so either join the

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:00,719
front or speak loudly okay so we've been

28
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:03,299
discussing on the mail list requirement

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,678
7 i'm going to put up Jose last comment

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:10,259
did you uh not that I see on the list

31
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:12,900
see if we like Joe Clark<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco I guess I</font>

32
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,670
replied to it I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> one clarifying</font>

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,710
question other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did like</font>

34
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,470
Joel's exhales I

35
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,140
he said I to our as agent priority and I

36
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:27,280
thought maybe he I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tourist client</font>

37
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,959
priority I'm but other than that yeah

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,670
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably what he meant I'm sure</font>

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,580
that's what he's meant from the that's

40
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:39,160
fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we'll take chills text on</font>

41
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:41,800
the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that'll be our new text and</font>

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:46,900
will consider the ephemeral stuff closed

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,760
and we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to last of all last</font>

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,260
call well your unit publishing you

45
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,570
version with this and then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it</font>

46
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">to last call yeah but it can go a short</font>

47
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,380
one week last call yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying</font>

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,420
but yeah yeah once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you publish it with</font>

49
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,920
that text and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you made</font>

50
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:08,140
then yeah we've got less column wait is

51
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:11,980
that patient it has to be agent Joe not

52
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,350
duck if you consider the ephemeral as

53
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:21,850
one hole that has to be agent I don't

54
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:28,769
think client agents priority<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

55
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:33,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">think Joe Clark I think what he got oh</font>

56
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:40,000
um would anyone like<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe today type</font>

57
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:42,880
in either pad in a few words volunteer

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,700
the volunteers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just coming out the</font>

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">woodwork I could see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well speak</font>

60
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,290
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> loudly at the recording because</font>

61
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,910
otherwise will you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't get noted in</font>

62
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,359
the scribe we can do the scribing later

63
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:02,260
go ahead yeah Joel did agree with me I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,140
mean we're saying that the he's saying

65
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:09,670
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I tend to agree that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not the</font>

66
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:12,700
entire FML config we're saying that that

67
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:16,659
the client that comes in has a priority

68
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,820
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this rights a femoral config with</font>

69
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,500
priority of that and then we're saying

70
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,790
we want to be able to override that with

71
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,790
local configuration

72
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,340
yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then this does this say that</font>

73
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,930
right I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the eight</font>

74
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:48,669
the client is the thing that has the

75
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:51,400
priority but when you but when you're

76
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:59,349
comparing it you're actually comparing

77
00:04:51,400 --> 00:05:01,030
it in the agent the<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the comparison</font>

78
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,740
would happen yet on the on the device

79
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,080
side that's why he's that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

80
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,120
thought it was agents is it you're

81
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,820
comparing you got one plane for a

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,979
femoral it got one lane four loko config

83
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,750
and you're comparing at the agent you're

84
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,030
comparing it in the agent but the

85
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,770
priority is comparable to what the

86
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,419
client has because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in the</font>

87
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:25,570
architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere it says that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

88
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:27,430
agent has a priority<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay well one</font>

89
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,190
that one more time on the list and make

90
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:33,340
sure it's okay thank you okay that

91
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:37,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">sounds great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the rest of it is</font>

92
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:42,310
fairly simple today after that

93
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,990
discussion we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go um we're</font>

94
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,389
going to go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple discussions</font>

95
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,699
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the model tell you what's good bad</font>

96
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:51,490
and changed and see if anybody can give

97
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:56,070
us some discussion feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hurry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

98
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,070
was hoping maybe on the rib you do it

99
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:04,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alexander and then G on the topology</font>

100
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,599
things because we're trying to close off

101
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:09,909
the discussions on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottle and decide</font>

102
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,479
if we're ready to send it to working

103
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:17,620
group last call<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I combined all of</font>

104
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:20,650
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> model stuff into one hopefully I</font>

105
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,500
didn't she sent me a note that said hi

106
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,989
you have the wrong file so I'm going to

107
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,419
give the combined file but if we don't

108
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,060
if you think your slides are wrong just

109
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:34,990
let me know so I'll start out with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

110
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:40,090
rib and Edwin can comment because he was

111
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:41,240
doing some of the hacking with me first

112
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,979
I'm gonna

113
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,020
hearken back to John Scudders review

114
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:51,530
which had a couple really good comments

115
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:54,930
he said why didn't we put in a rip ID

116
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:58,979
you know we put it in a name but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

117
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:03,720
rib ID and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyplace else we had a name</font>

118
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:05,730
in a a rib and in reality looking at the

119
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,460
code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be a better so that's a</font>

120
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:12,390
suggestion to the through the working

121
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:15,659
group any questions about the suggestion

122
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,300
I think we'll give it a shot<font color="#E5E5E5"> with code</font>

123
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,120
and see what happens why are the

124
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,460
restrictions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

125
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,440
are the restrictions on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next hop</font>

126
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,870
change certain things in the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> half</font>

127
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,050
chain might not make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cheney</font>

128
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:34,350
integrase interface to integrate

129
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,270
interface IP might not make sense so

130
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,890
that's another piece where as we walk

131
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:43,979
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code we seem to have</font>

132
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:45,599
problems it's unclear<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the text and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

133
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,800
think that maybe editorial while the

134
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:53,970
next hop is problems it also is unclear

135
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,820
how and Nick's hops are chosen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I</font>

136
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:00,630
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are pieces that we need to</font>

137
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:05,340
discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list did anybody see any</font>

138
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:07,140
of these in the list and the ribbon sort

139
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,560
of want to discuss otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll take</font>

140
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:13,020
this to the list but I thought many of

141
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,810
these were really good why is the reason

142
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,969
for change their reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

143
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">notification and them for next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hop</font>

144
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,410
change notification I i found that

change without informing a parent route

153
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:51,860
was that what we talked about or is that

157
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:08,000
giving different structures for one

158
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:12,949
example the all the next hops were

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,630
attached directly to route match and for

160
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,330
the implementation it was a little bit

161
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,660
strange so what we were proposing is

162
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:23,360
that they were in the same are key and

163
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you would point to the next hop because</font>

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,670
then the next hops could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> chart and</font>

165
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,450
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new version of the document seems to</font>

166
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:37,339
be better representing that right so

167
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:40,190
that the when you add and delete the

168
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,660
next top and it's shared it might be

169
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,720
shared between a whole bunch of routes

170
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:49,010
you need to inform other people right

171
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,020
it's attached it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one the other</font>

172
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,900
question I have and that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

173
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,750
float on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list is our next hop basic</font>

174
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,180
is not is fairly extensive you know it's

175
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:03,650
got every type of encapsulation should

176
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:15,770
it just be ipv4 and ipv6 it should be

177
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:18,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the encapsulations why is that but</font>

178
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,230
try that just just so we can capture

179
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">army carrico and then then i can catch</font>

telephonic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think here the i would not</font>

182
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,280
restrict that to just ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 because</font>

183
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:35,030
you may have addressed families there

184
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,610
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> VRS and stuff that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you may want to</font>

185
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,500
have the information in the next top 40

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">i agree that you should have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

187
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,540
question is whether the structure in the

188
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:47,150
switch that's the minimal when you when

189
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through and you parse it you have</font>

190
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,699
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> keyword</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of nets not basic yes should</font>

191
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,550
that next hop basic just be ipv4 and I

192
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,830
v6 and then the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing down say next</font>

193
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,229
hop extended which would be all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

194
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:03,650
other tunnels or should the basic really

195
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,520
have all the the tunnel pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

196
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you use</font>

197
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,170
I think you should unify<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to just</font>

198
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:12,230
one because at the end for me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

199
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">same whether it's a basic ipv4 or ipv6</font>

200
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,300
or something that has more thing it's a

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">next-hop so okay I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see that I</font>

202
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,359
don't see this distinction between basic

203
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,550
and extended to be important<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

204
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,560
looking in efficiency of code but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

205
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,959
put out the code and leave that one but

206
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,819
the informing of the shared route and

207
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:36,260
some of these other comments I think

208
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,660
we've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take care of these are just</font>

209
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,400
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> high we've implemented pieces</font>

210
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,160
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> John's looked at it who's actually</font>

211
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,040
done a lot of coding we should at least

212
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,110
have answers we can say that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ribs</font>

213
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:55,910
fine but the code should inform this

214
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:57,860
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok robert rizzo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most powerful</font>

215
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,600
feature of next hop is actual recursion

216
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,010
so it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really makes too much</font>

217
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,020
sense to load it with all the attributes

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,850
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tunnel let's say because it will</font>

221
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,540
in the overlay I put it with the I to RS

222
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,670
and one route with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> channel and next</font>

224
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,410
not to the overlay layer and that's a

<font color="#E5E5E5">marriage and I would really need to</font>

229
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,140
seen that even when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you recurse at the</font>

230
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:46,819
very end you end up by ending in a point

231
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:51,819
which might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vrf linked or something</font>

232
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:54,320
that it's not basic happy before nope I

233
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:59,030
I have to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that but i think</font>

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:02,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not ok so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is we will code</font>

235
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,939
pieces and then send out both code and

comments on changes in other words<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

keep will make some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these are unclear</font>

238
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:14,150
like other restrictions in the next top

chain that should at least be covered

240

some place in the document and

how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they in next hops chosen the</font>

242
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,019
rest will try to give code examples and

243
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:29,569
try to actually be practical because it

244
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:31,939
may not we've done the informational

245
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:35,569
draft for a long time and logically that

246
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:38,299
holds together but these pieces are code

00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:40,639
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the yang model holds together so</font>

there your choice this is the front<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike</font>

259
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,839
we have to sort of raise it up I think

00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:19,459
well this one is high enough so<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't we you can take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out of you can</font>

267
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:40,759
because i made the print big enough to

see in the back so all right okay so

269
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:48,949
this physical turns day and the yang

in the model we define the topologies

279

can be can be layered so you can have a

287
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:37,930
the lower levels of the of the model and

288

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prodigies themselves can be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">really from from the network operations</font>

292
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,940
and this also applies that topologies

293
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,250
could be configured I could be

294
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,140
configured on proper file on top of

295
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,810
other topology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had been discovered</font>

296
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,730
and so basically regarding that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

297
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,680
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> be read-only configure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lengths of</font>

298
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,040
oven basically how do we resolve and

299
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:09,859
that that's all that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of issue and</font>

300
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:11,510
can you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next likely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so and</font>

301
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,210
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very solution that were</font>

302
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:17,180
discussed actually we went now actually

303
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:20,510
finally full circle if you will and came

304
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:24,199
basically back to the pretty much to the

305
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:26,960
original model that we had again quite

306
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,480
quite a while ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically the</font>

307
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,610
solution is that we but<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also now in</font>

308
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,500
the document in the draft that we have

309
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:37,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same model whether the topology is</font>

310
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,260
discovered or whether it's configured by

311
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,210
client applications or they all

312
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,180
basically instantiate the same part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

313
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:46,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same yang module we do</font>

314
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,489
have a leaf that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a read-only</font>

315
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,699
operational object but busy indicates

316
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,110
the source of the network topology and

317
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:57,140
basically it indicates whether or not

318
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,120
and that apology was discovered and

319
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially populated by the server of</font>

valid was configured by a client may ask

322
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,300
is this the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you found him</font>

323
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:13,280
initially<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggested death is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

324
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,448
original solution that is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> went into</font>

325
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:21,020
the original opendaylight<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy patient</font>

326
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:22,550
so we had other solutions I not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

327
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,800
keep is on the other pivot we had this

328
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">this we had discussed basically a number</font>

329
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,490
of alternatives one thing must have

330
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,500
split the model into state portion and

331
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,330
clay into a configuration portion that

332
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,250
have various issues having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font>

333
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:39,020
how you are and how you extend the model

334
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:41,110
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last item that we were here</font>

335
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,730
they yeah the

336
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay night some of the solution that</font>

337
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:47,320
some of the alternatives that were

338
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,770
considered another alternative that we

339
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,928
had considered was to use and yang

340
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:57,330
extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tag the server provided</font>

341
00:17:52,929 --> 00:18:00,460
info is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chief on had also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

342
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,559
suggested<font color="#CCCCCC"> and but it or not baby they'd</font>

343
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,270
also put the young doctor review this is

344
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,450
not necessary and also actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer</font>

345
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,830
because that this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implemented</font>

346
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,450
solution like the one that is implement

347
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:16,540
is the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone full circle</font>

348
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:19,750
on now and yeah so so yeah this is just

349
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,120
for reminder that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the the</font>

350
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,770
overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the model maybe that fool</font>

351
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,870
module spacing within this the base

352
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,309
network inventory and then basically the

353
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:31,629
network topology which includes the

354
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:34,418
linky termination point information yeah

355
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:38,610
this hasn't changed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think you</font>

356
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:38,610
could go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details here and</font>

357
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,600
yeah basically in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the updates</font>

358
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,059
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft itself there are just very</font>

359
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,809
small Victorian updates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the text</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

360
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:53,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the descriptions to this to throw the</font>

361
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:55,899
discussion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues and so forth</font>

362
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,700
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions were raised</font>

363
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,830
recently on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue this were also</font>

364
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,020
very why do we model network types as

365
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,678
container notnot<font color="#E5E5E5"> samosa please identity</font>

366
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,510
refs i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the teacher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is closed</font>

367
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,549
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically but fundamentally it's a</font>

368
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,669
one thing that he it's a design choice

369
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:14,590
but it facilitates allowing networks to

370
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:17,340
have multiple types<font color="#E5E5E5"> martinis and also</font>

371
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,899
automatically this essentially been

372
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,689
reflecting the the hierarchy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

373
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,520
inheritance hierarchy basically of the

374
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,650
topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that basically a topology is</font>

375
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,340
also part of a up with super types if

376
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:34,000
you will in the model and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then finally</font>

377
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:36,490
there is another apology model the layer

378
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">three topology that funders had a</font>

379
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:42,730
refresh release it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't really has</font>

380
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,918
really changed did undergo a young

381
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,840
doctor review and was deemed in

382
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,679
reasonable shape there are few updates

383
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,678
needed actually we are well that

384
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,240
particularly many of the yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> sophia is</font>

385
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font>

386
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,250
and so both objects actually require

387
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,620
updates in terms of the description and

388
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">so forth and so ready some of the draft</font>

389
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,750
updates that need our editorial

390
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,720
clarifications and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah with some of the</font>

391
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:14,890
others here so hopefully we'll find some

392
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,600
time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> meteor during this week and the</font>

393
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,550
other suggestion that was made to also

394
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,280
coordinate with the young authors of the

395
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:24,129
ospf and I is is working groups because

396
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,190
there are submodels defined in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> alias</font>

397
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:29,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">late apology to talk about ospf and is</font>

398
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,520
is specifically so that is we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

399
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:40,120
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a consolidated</font>

400
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:43,540
picture questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um I want it is</font>

401
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:47,320
the intent to the next step to be to go

402
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:50,678
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group last call and based on</font>

403
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,740
discussions we had with Benoit yesterday

404
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:57,700
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and do this in advance of</font>

405
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:00,070
even the net confident mod working group

406
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:07,809
settling on their off state<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus non</font>

407
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:10,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">op state so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can that is the chairs</font>

408
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:13,030
antennas to do a working group last call

409
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:19,030
once these editorial pieces come in are

410
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:22,149
there questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok GD do you want to</font>

411
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:27,270
give your short discussion well I think

412
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll bring up your slides as you sent me</font>

413
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:37,209
so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some brief update about the</font>

414
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:39,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">layer do topology model we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> received some</font>

comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the routing director</font>

416
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,429
review so in some update accordingly

417
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:48,070
specs is this a leer tu<font color="#E5E5E5"> topology model</font>

418
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:50,140

430
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:27,520
the model and in the description<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

431
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,860
clarify that this layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 topology model</font>

432
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,830
can be used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> both the physical</font>

433
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:35,290
virtual network topologies and also the

434
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:39,189
logic and watch virtual there's no

435
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:42,159
apologies so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is are we</font>

436
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">having this update and we would like to</font>

437
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more reviews from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

438
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:49,120
and to see if there's some any missing

439
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,120
parts in this model or in the

440
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,300
descriptions thank you I'd like to also

441
00:22:52,120 --> 00:23:01,239
ask do we know of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any implementations of</font>

442
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:03,220
the LT portion of the model ok I think

443
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll send through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones with</font>

444
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:09,880
implementation and we can always augment

445
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,350
this as we get an implementation or<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

446
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:17,880
initial idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> You</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> G for your time</font>

447
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:21,010
ok so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our agenda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for today we've made</font>

448
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,440
good progress against our time frame

449
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,510
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very short we've done our</font>

450
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,150
model discussion and we're about five

451
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:31,410
minutes early one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we</font>

452
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:35,610
discussed in the past on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mail list</font>

453
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:38,670
extensively during after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yokohama</font>

454
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:41,459
was some of the conflict resolution and

455
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:43,870
Pedro has been working on some actual

456
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,120
implementation and wants to share with

457
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:49,379
us some insight so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up</font>

458
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,379
his presentation next

459
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,180
okay that want to thank you super much

460
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,180
for the introduction and for the

461
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:09,750
possibility of sharing this insights

462
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:15,120
with the group this as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see this</font>

463
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:18,330
comes from a no no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no that it's it's</font>

464
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,810
good that okay like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's fine it</font>

465
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:23,550
would be fine with me so this comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

466
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:27,179
from a project which is called net ID

467
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:31,110
part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fp7 framework in the</font>

468
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:34,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">European Union and although not specific</font>

469
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,639
I to RS there are some we've been doing

470
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,340
extensive work on conflict resolution

471
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,720
and I think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some general results</font>

472
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,830
which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting for you as a</font>

473
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:48,720
working group so please next whoops next

474
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:53,820
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I said this is results from the</font>

475
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,340
net ID project it it was very very open

476
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,439
flow centric at the beginning but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

477
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:01,679
extending it but where they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

478
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,440
extended<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover other protocols so</font>

479
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,240
current status open flow we r version

480
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,910
oblivious and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we are</font>

481
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,130
doing and we are extending that to

482
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:15,630
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is supported on netconf</font>

483
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:17,460
and as a protocol next one short recap

484
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,790
of the architecture and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think there's</font>

485
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:23,490
some it was partially in even inspired

486
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:26,610
with by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the architectural you have been</font>

487
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:29,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">working here on in in I to RS so we have</font>

488
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,840
an open flow controller in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom</font>

489
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,810
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we call this servo</font>

490
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,840
controller framework that has a short

491
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:39,240
shim layer then we have a core layer or

492
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:44,820
the magic regarding computer solution

493
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:47,540
and application composition and then at

494
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:50,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book at the top we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a three</font>

495
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:53,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful we have another layer which</font>

496
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,710
has the control controllers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,740
controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> soaring and those climb</font>

498
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:02,490
controllers are those that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

499
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:05,190
executing the applications for the

500
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:08,760
different applications actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go</font>

501
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:12,150
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> more further step and say that the</font>

502
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,540
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are being executed in</font>

503
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,180
the

504
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,250
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually just modules of something</font>

505
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,340
bigger and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we call our a net</font>

506
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,630
ID application so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marta controller</font>

507
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,449
support which was something very

508
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,640
important for us lots of people coming

509
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the University wonderful experience</font>

510
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,680
in smaller controllers like<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

511
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:35,430
real which is Python or flood land which

512
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:38,040
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Java but small scale but if you</font>

513
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,660
want to go to a bigger production

514
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,639
environment you need something at the

515
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:45,690
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> something facing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network that</font>

516
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,120
is more reliable and that basically the

517
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,610
work my team did was more on open

518
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,010
daylight and within the project we have

519
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:56,490
PA partners who are very proficient in

520
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:59,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">honors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they've also been working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

521
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:04,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network controller facing the</font>

522
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:07,230
network elements being honest and all

523
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:09,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you see here very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much what</font>

524
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:12,240
the onf is saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about sdn</font>

525
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:16,650
architectures<font color="#CCCCCC"> and next slide please so</font>

526
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:20,430
our model is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a module</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that</font>

527
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:23,790
might be receiving an input an event or

528
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:26,310
no input or multiple input this is why i

529
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:29,370
put am<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting here that famous star in</font>

530
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:31,620
the events and that module which is

531
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:34,800
basically a small as the end application

532
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:37,409
may generate zero or more commands

533
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:42,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the general model of the of the</font>

534
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:45,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">OpenFlow application and you say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

535
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,490
can't receive events or not and you can

536
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,530
produce commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not I don't know if</font>

537
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:53,790
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> model or non model that's my</font>

538
00:27:49,530 --> 00:28:00,389
first question so one of the things we

539
00:27:53,790 --> 00:28:06,540
did or simplifying that please next

540
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:09,300
slide so we wanted to look at a complete

541
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:12,270
resolution right so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some</font>

542
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:15,240
assumptions first of all is that if you

543
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:19,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the network state as such any</font>

544
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,870
command isolated with no context will

545
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,370
not produce any kind of conflict akin to

546
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,530
the network state because you really

547
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:30,449
cannot tell whether the

548
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:34,080
is a conflict or not there are things

549
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:36,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that may sound like conflicts like for</font>

550
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,360
example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network interface and</font>

551
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,700
you want to shut it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down despite this</font>

552
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,889
being currently active but there are

553
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,200
applications that do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for</font>

554
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,750
example energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> efficiency there's no</font>

555
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,950
conflict than that for us another thing

556
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:55,050
is you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a prefix and you may want to</font>

557
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:58,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the network the next stop for</font>

558
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:01,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever reason for example the you have</font>

559
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:03,990
a link that is overflowing that is

560
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:06,330
really congesting and you want to put

561
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:10,160
some of the traffic of that link into

562
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">onto another link to avoid congestion</font>

563
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,840
the other thing we said is ok if you

564
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,719
have a nun result that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not what</font>

565
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,139
you're really intended by doing this

566
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,420
actions if that was an isolated<font color="#CCCCCC"> come on</font>

567
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,460
you have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the application</font>

568
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:28,890
erode you cannot rely on someone on

569
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:34,500
telling you that this is a an actual

570
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:37,140
conflict you have to look up and the

571
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,840
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that in this case for us</font>

572
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">at least the network element should not</font>

573
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,850
try to resolve any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complex there</font>

574
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,250
so a quick question exam what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

575
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">need miss conflict confused but actually</font>

576
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,720
valued by you boys even result is

577
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">unwanted I mean usually a conflict</font>

578
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,340
between my little things our country yes

579
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:59,370
but conflict<font color="#E5E5E5"> between what's what's you</font>

580
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:03,330
know I mean yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exactly first</font>

581
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:05,129
light there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conflict what I want to</font>

582
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,230
say here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a given</font>

583
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:09,270
Network state and isolated comment will

584
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,520
never complete with it was this network

585
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:15,420
state this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the things we had a</font>

586
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,050
long discussion on so you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

587
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:22,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a neck that would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next slide</font>

588
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:22,820
as you really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more than one</font>

589
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:30,960
this one yeah you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

590
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:33,300
more than one command that is generated

591
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">by the same event to start speaking</font>

592
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">about conflict if you have an event</font>

593
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:42,250
that generates a command with one module

594
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:44,830
and that same event generates another

595
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,510
command on another module then you can

596
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:49,720
start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a complete</font>

597
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">resolution that's the that's the whole</font>

598
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,510
message so one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first things we</font>

599
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,210
did is for me a command or a series of

600
00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:01,780
command isolated from the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

601
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:04,840
context that<font color="#E5E5E5"> snow makes sense so what we</font>

602
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,970
wanted what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually binding</font>

603
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,860
the resulting commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it to the</font>

604
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:12,010
event that generated them in the module

605
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:14,830
and that's what we call a transaction

606
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:16,270
and for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually went into some</font>

607
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,639
of the controllers and started

608
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:22,720
implementing books so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

609
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:30,520
actually delimit one a water transaction

610
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:33,730
is next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please so when you have a</font>

611
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:36,220
transactions and when you start doing

612
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:39,310
for a working with transactions then you

613
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:42,190
can start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about conflicts</font>

614
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:44,080
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> kelan's why because when you</font>

615
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:47,230
have two or<font color="#E5E5E5"> more transactions that are</font>

616
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,689
triggered<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the same network event and</font>

617
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:52,300
sent to the network then you can

618
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually define what a conflict is for</font>

619
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:58,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">example if one applications tells me to</font>

620
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:02,080
activate an interface and another one

621
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:05,560
tells me to take to turn it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to shut</font>

622
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,840
it off then there's a conflict there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

623
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,149
that's something that you can actually

624
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,050
start doing actions it is another

625
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:16,720
example um one client says set this

626
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:19,540
route to this next hop and the second

627
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,640
client says it's the same route to a

628
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:28,270
different next<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly that would be</font>

629
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:31,690
another one or set I always<font color="#CCCCCC"> say shut</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

630
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:34,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">shut down or activate an interface but</font>

631
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,880
the next stop is a wonderful secondary

632
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:39,790
example yeah it's it's a it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you</font>

633
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,750
in a better example of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> not turning</font>

634
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:46,690
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and off the interfaces</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Joe Clark um</font>

635
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:48,790
but meaning to request with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

636
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,690
priority to request<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the same</font>

637
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,779
priority

638
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:54,909
generated by the same event so that's

639
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:57,789
the that's the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a very</font>

640
00:32:54,909 --> 00:33:05,320
good refinement of my yeah no no of

641
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:08,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">course so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah next slide please we</font>

642
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,840
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> started looking for exactly for</font>

643
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:12,908
these things in another context and that

644
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,918
was composing applications you have

645
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:17,860
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the end applications there</font>

646
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:19,870
and you want to do things together one

647
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the classical examples if you have a</font>

648
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:24,399
firewall that is facing the internet and

649
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:28,570
then you have a layer to switch that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

650
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:32,768
the your functionality in in a in a

651
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:34,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">deliver in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ in a data center you</font>

652
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:38,129
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to implement those things as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

653
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:41,049
the end and then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find a</font>

654
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:43,928
couple of very interesting effects next

655
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:46,799
slide please actually you've seen it

656
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:49,450
ever but you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the logical</font>

657
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,039
way of thinking is you have the the

658
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,440
firewall before and then you have the

659
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,820
layer to switch but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

660
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,980
down it interesting and one of the

661
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:59,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">things we found out is that you can't</font>

662
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:04,269
have the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> functions in parallel and</font>

663
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:06,879
then have a block to do the composing or

664
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:09,129
complete resolution and you do that in

665
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:12,069
parallel and you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in parallel</font>

666
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:14,668
because actually the same packet is

667
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:17,050
going to be triggering the firewall

668
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:21,638
application and the layer to switch

669
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:24,609
application next like please so one of

670
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,889
the things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are currently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all</font>

671
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:29,078
these things in open flow less code

672
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:31,720
available in our github we have a github

673
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:36,220
in thee with all the code there if you

674
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:38,980
want to experiment with that we have we

675
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:40,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">are working currently with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> air with</font>

676
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,629
a integration of net compass they're

677
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:46,599
carrying protocol and then looking what

678
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:49,980
is inside there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other thing</font>

679
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:54,040
where I really need to have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

680
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:57,609
help here is what happens when you have

681
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:01,390
applications that are proactive ie they

682
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:03,509
they don't they generate command without

683
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,100
any event

684
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:08,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> input that's something that we</font>

685
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:11,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">are looking at one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that</font>

686
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:15,630
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the situations that normally</font>

687
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:18,810
happens or that is very noise when you

688
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,630
start up an application and that sets up

689
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:23,279
the network state at the beginning that

690
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:26,130
kind of things is something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we</font>

691
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,980
are currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at and if the</font>

692
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,110
working group has any ideas place them

693
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,580
on the mailing list on how you would

694
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,250
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that interpreter because</font>

695
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:40,080
that may be also interesting parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

696
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:42,420
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide I'm sorry I forgot one slight</font>

697
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:46,230
forgot to send you one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> worthy with</font>

698
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:50,120
a with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pointers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay just send it</font>

699
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:53,370
i'll send reflect on me<font color="#CCCCCC"> english yep</font>

700
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:56,120
again the code is available you can mix

701
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:59,310
and match all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

702
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:03,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications there and although it's</font>

703
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:06,600
open flow specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the concept</font>

704
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:08,730
the concept might be interesting for for

705
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:13,140
the group to discuss on to further

706
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:19,280
elaborate so the the github is and net

707
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:22,200
ID if<font color="#E5E5E5"> FPS and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anetta fp7 / net ID and</font>

708
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,660
there you'll find everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the code</font>

709
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,669
we have if you would send that to list

710
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,680
that will help people get yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen</font>

711
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:31,680
that exercise I don't know why I didn't

712
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,690
what was not exported but any I'll send

713
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,230
that extra slack to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list thank you</font>

714
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:39,600
ok I'll thanks a lot for the opportunity

715
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:43,110
of presenting this oh you're welcome one

716
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:47,940
thing that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really been interesting</font>

717
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:51,150
another part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his group was looking at</font>

718
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:54,720
firewalls and looking in resolution of

719
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:57,960
firewall conflict rules which applies to

720
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,959
our filter based rib because in the end

721
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,840
what how do you define if two filters

722
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,370
are conflict right now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have two</font>

723
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:14,160
entries based on a prefix and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> priority</font>

724
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:16,680
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what the basic grip is</font>

725
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,370
but their group went on and and tried to

726
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,810
talk

727
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:21,020
out at a higher level for the

728
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:24,270
application what does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean to have</font>

729
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:26,670
rules conflict what are the ways that

730
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:29,400
people resolve it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you</font>

731
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,800
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a global security policy and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

732
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,040
local security policy there's a

733
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:39,690
resolution for security devices now

734
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:41,820
that's above r2s work for just setting

735
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,710
the filter based policy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

736
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,870
interesting to know the applications

737
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,930
because it may help us understand what

738
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:52,400
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing yeah and as you say right</font>

739
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:56,129
now it comes to my mind that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

740
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,740
very if you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> abstract a bit all</font>

741
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:03,150
these rules all this overflow rules are

742
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:09,479
basically like access lists yes and and

743
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:11,550
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um again our work is quite how quite</font>

744
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,040
extensible and quite applicable here in

745
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:17,780
this working group isn't it is open flow

746
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:21,920
centric right and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these filters</font>

747
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:25,650
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conflict resolution provide a</font>

748
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,050
way to compare policy and way to compare

749
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,720
pieces one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things we had in our</font>

750
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">early discussions about priority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

751
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,370
priority resolution was how could it

752
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,600
really deal with the filter base trip

753
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:40,290
where you're actually putting in

754
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:45,270
essentially an extensive of ACL or a

755
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:49,529
 a packet-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> ECA policy so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

756
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:51,840
just ask Pedro if he'd go ahead and give

757
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:55,710
this presentation because we talked

758
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:58,140
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> initially what happened right now</font>

759
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:00,480
we're treating all of the ephemeral work

760
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,150
as a single pane of glass but in the

761
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,940
future we may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reconsider how</font>

762
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:09,150
clients work and that had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with how</font>

763
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,210
you do resolution within the pain the

764
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:15,180
set of panes of glass that are ephemeral

765
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:17,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you again just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one next last</font>

766
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:21,060
comment there is a there was a this

767
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:23,069
workshop on last Saturday and we

768
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,170
presented an extended paper on this on

769
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,970
that on that workshop send a pointer to

770
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:32,300
that the list just so that people know

771
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:32,299
where they can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and next yan are you</font>

772
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:50,670
spirit let me get well I got our PDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

773
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:53,520
spent its younger one<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

774
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,619
please go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you thank you for</font>

775
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,869
giving me the opportunity to present<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

776
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:04,619
chart this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about a day Center fabric</font>

777
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:06,180
topology so the scenario is what we want

778
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:09,540
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here is state center</font>

779
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:11,940
networks actually nowadays with the

780
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">increase of big data and many</font>

781
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:18,060
applications at the data in the network

782
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:21,060
is much more important so they met at a

783
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,640
center network is also a big market for

784
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:28,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">no no not only the enterprise but also</font>

785
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:32,970
the operators so next so with this

786
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:35,700
entire big networks what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

787
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:39,029
here is we go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what we are doing</font>

788
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:41,700
nowadays nowadays administrators have to

789
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:44,609
manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> these internet works each notes</font>

790
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:48,210
in these networks not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the physical</font>

791
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:50,819
layer but also the overlay at overlay

792
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:53,580
layers so when the new overlay

793
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:56,730
technologies or and new technologies

794
00:40:53,580 --> 00:41:00,990
applying to this kind of big<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font>

795
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:04,500
also for the scale of this network sighs

796
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:06,810
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are here to the administrators have</font>

797
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,930
to do much work they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about</font>

798
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:13,890
each notes and it's applied technologies

799
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:16,710
which causes the complexity of network

800
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:20,730
management as we may know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the center is</font>

801
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:25,109
composed<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fabrics which also know as</font>

802
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:29,220
spots when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> skin are when the</font>

803
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:32,970
dissenters gears at the operators or the

804
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:35,700
enterprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to add new pots into this</font>

805
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:38,339
kind of network so each part<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have</font>

806
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,470
the similar overlay technology in the

807
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,770
similar structures so the only thing

808
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,740
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is what is for</font>

809
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font>

810
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,750
and also these ports how this part can

811
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:53,709
be connection to other<font color="#E5E5E5"> port in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

812
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:56,560
network so with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept we define a</font>

813
00:41:53,710 --> 00:42:00,100
fabric to party for on top of the

814
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing physical infrastructures to let</font>

815
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:06,040
emanate administrators to care about the

816
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:08,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">network link fabrics and the connection</font>

817
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">between these fabrics so the detail</font>

818
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:15,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenger or the requirements of this</font>

819
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:19,150
topology staff can be found on the

820
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:23,290
another draft which is in SD energy it's

821
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:25,810
from operator requirements next so what

822
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:28,600
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do here is we want to ease</font>

823
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:31,299
the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> center network management while</font>

824
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:35,200
providing capacities capability and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

825
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:38,320
technology extensibility which means we

826
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,350
win the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center skills they only have</font>

827
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,500
to add a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> fabrics into this whole</font>

828
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:48,819
network and only cares about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

829
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:52,330
specific drag fabric I used the

830
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:55,720
technology also the fabrics connected to

831
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:58,240
existing fabrics so the second wise to

832
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:01,089
build the second ability is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say to</font>

833
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,339
build a objective fabric topology for

834
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:07,390
the day Center overlay which maps to

835
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:10,960
phila coat apologies so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a common</font>

836
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:13,240
fabric topology with common attributes

837
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,840
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this Center networks or where we</font>

838
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,850
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> imports so the last one is to is</font>

839
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,570
finally to ease the network

840
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:27,130
configurations to<font color="#E5E5E5"> users next it's thank</font>

841
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:31,180
you so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we use this topology</font>

842
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:33,700
model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use it by controller to</font>

843
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:37,509
configure the spine and leaves the

844
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:40,029
physical notes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks to let</font>

845
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:42,970
the physical notes<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose to know what</font>

846
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:45,190
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of role it plays in the whole</font>

847
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:47,020
network and also it can be used by a

848
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:49,090
networking manager system to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terra</font>

849
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:55,240
controller how this whole network looks

850
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:58,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">like so next thank you so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

851
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,598
relation to existing model seeing eye

852
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,869
two

853
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:07,119
is as you may see a fabric<font color="#CCCCCC"> apologies</font>

854
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:12,599
eyes and kind of new things based on the

855
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:15,519
network topology bottle next so also

856
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:19,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">potential models is since we have the</font>

857
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:22,089
different day<font color="#CCCCCC"> centres fairy types maybe</font>

858
00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:25,900
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> trio fabric and the excellent</font>

859
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:31,509
fabric or future GPU fabric the party in

860
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:34,329
the next 14 steps next so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

861
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:38,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">fabric paster the center</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> topology</font>

862
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:41,410
management look like so while it does is

863
00:44:38,229 --> 00:44:43,960
the fabric<font color="#E5E5E5"> storage models collect a set</font>

864
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:47,410
of physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes into the fabric and</font>

865
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,960
the fabric will care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about its</font>

866
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:53,348
connection to other fabrics and it

867
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,749
manages its internal fabric connection

868
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:58,229
and also care about the connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

869
00:44:55,749 --> 00:45:01,259
other fabrics so it were<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaving the</font>

870
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:06,819
administrators with details of the

871
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:12,609
physical layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff so next yeah this</font>

872
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:15,788
is the very simple and initial date

873
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:18,729
models for the fabric topology I'll

874
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:21,219
which has also has a note<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the links</font>

875
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:26,558
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's mapping to the underlay</font>

876
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:31,420
underlay topology notes so that's that's

877
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:34,299
all I think that's this nice i thank you

878
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:39,479
so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to give a bit of context and</font>

879
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:42,670
let us questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> again one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

880
00:45:39,479 --> 00:45:45,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">have stopped our models of you stopped</font>

881
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:48,400
it to the basic l2 l3 topology and you

882
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:50,440
notice we sort of stopped our service

883
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,569
topology work because we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

884
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,700
questions from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael some of the</font>

885
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:57,969
presentation that we're going on here is

886
00:45:54,700 --> 00:46:00,729
to look and where that expansion should

887
00:45:57,969 --> 00:46:03,969
be for topologies either in service

888
00:46:00,729 --> 00:46:07,808
model forward so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not directly in</font>

889
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:10,719
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter but could be as we're sort</font>

890
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:12,170
of getting to the end of the basic

891
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:16,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">charter model rib</font>

892
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:18,049
filter rib and topology we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

893
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:22,220
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these other discussions</font>

894
00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:24,589
conflict resolution data center fabric

895
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:27,290
as reasonable extensions to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

896
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:31,069
they are not i'll repeat in charter but

897
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:34,730
part of our discussion so<font color="#E5E5E5"> given that is</font>

898
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:39,819
there any feedback for yon on her model

899
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:39,819
or on your thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> on its usability</font>

900
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:52,400
just a few big this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is alex chem so i</font>

901
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:55,040
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an application i think this is</font>

902
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,410
absolutely make sense and<font color="#E5E5E5"> jack and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

903
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,509
also i know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some discussion this</font>

904
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:02,740
afternoon yeah yeah we have a detailed

905
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:07,460
discussion on the home waters and see

906
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:09,229
good um I'm glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's helpful we're</font>

907
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:14,089
thinking about applications and other

908
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:15,980
things well we've we've ended up early

909
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:20,328
unless there are other questions any

910
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:21,680
other questions for young just have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

911
00:47:20,329 --> 00:47:23,780
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> question so what are the next</font>

912
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:27,710
steps then regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of those models</font>

913
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:29,809
and moving them<font color="#CCCCCC"> xolo the process that's</font>

914
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:32,150
a process question on the topology model

915
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:36,650
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can have a comfortable seat thank</font>

916
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:39,380
you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much so the process a good</font>

917
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:42,230
question what is the process model<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

918
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:44,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the topologies you had a few things for</font>

919
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:46,190
the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three topology which has been</font>

920
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented in the base topology which</font>

921
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:51,500
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented you need to correct</font>

922
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,270
those drafts and then send a note to

923
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,780
your working group chair saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

924
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:59,869
ready for my working group last call

925
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:02,540
chairs excuse me so I think the base

926
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:04,369
model i think we are basically ready

927
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,140
with it i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's the the one that</font>

928
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:08,990
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> some update is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a layer three model</font>

929
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:10,520
and we have something I don't know

930
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:14,450
there's some work to do but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

931
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:16,460
regards to the basic model do you want

932
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:19,819
to send them through together separately

933
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:24,410
as the author I<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not one of the</font>

934
00:48:19,819 --> 00:48:25,999
authors<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here my muffin would be I</font>

935
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,288
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

936
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:29,089
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> package and we could do that</font>

937
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:32,149
separately because I feel also the

938
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:33,589
general topology is a foundation or busy

939
00:48:32,149 --> 00:48:36,739
the base model for some of the other

940
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:38,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whereas the l3 is kind</font>

941
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:41,359
of like in parallel with the other so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

942
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:43,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so i feel it's probably important</font>

943
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:47,239
to get the pacing food we should not

944
00:48:43,939 --> 00:48:49,669
have the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 progress holds the base</font>

945
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:53,179
model up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start the base</font>

946
00:48:49,669 --> 00:48:56,569
though the base topology model if I

947
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:58,909
guess question about the South<font color="#E5E5E5"> Country</font>

948
00:48:56,569 --> 00:49:03,529
there's a discussion about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> office</font>

949
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:06,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">state in the mode so that may affect all</font>

950
00:49:03,529 --> 00:49:09,649
models here so do we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wait down</font>

951
00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:11,839
Wow every door needle I had a long and

952
00:49:09,649 --> 00:49:14,569
vigorous discussion with this at the

953
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,308
routing cheers meeting and I think the

954
00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:18,558
answer i got from benoit that he

955
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:22,339
guaranteed me that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

956
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:27,319
go ahead and if this means<font color="#E5E5E5"> we refactor</font>

957
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:29,269
models later my understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

958
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:31,219
discussion yesterday and you can correct

959
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:34,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">me leah is we're just going to go</font>

960
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:37,819
forward right oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

961
00:49:34,459 --> 00:49:40,038
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct you on that though one</font>

962
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:44,269
interesting suggestion that loom 8 and

963
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:46,029
RT g WG that the routing architecture

964
00:49:44,269 --> 00:49:50,118
design teams considering is suggesting

965
00:49:46,029 --> 00:49:52,849
that for models that have the applied

966
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:55,849
and intended that you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

967
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:59,089
intended isn't like that basically you

968
00:49:55,849 --> 00:50:00,769
could treat<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extra tree as an</font>

969
00:49:59,089 --> 00:50:03,379
augmentation so that you can sort of

970
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:05,749
have your cake and eat it too they're

971
00:50:03,379 --> 00:50:08,808
still talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it might be</font>

972
00:50:05,749 --> 00:50:12,859
interesting was actually going to

973
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:14,539
request is as we develop knowledge of

974
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:16,788
implementations particularly for the

975
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:19,939
models it would be really nice to put

976
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:21,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">that up on the wiki one of the tricks</font>

977
00:50:19,939 --> 00:50:23,899
here is making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure all the models are</font>

978
00:50:21,649 --> 00:50:26,749
going to interoperate and connect up

979
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:29,538
properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so getting some sense of</font>

980
00:50:26,749 --> 00:50:31,879
the implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> state and how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

981
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:35,779
what what's been played<font color="#CCCCCC"> with together</font>

982
00:50:31,879 --> 00:50:39,019
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really helpful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for assessing it</font>

983
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:39,670
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very eager to have the yang models</font>

984
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:42,399
in

985
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:46,270
mark ingram afford thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

986
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:49,089
Alex I and I think we will create a wiki

987
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:53,650
spot now send you know on what to give

988
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:56,410
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> is input from your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OTL topology go</font>

989
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:59,470
ahead if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual Edith apply</font>

990
00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:02,259
was as intended confusion but not affect

991
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:05,618
us it's subtle in<font color="#CCCCCC"> general other opposite</font>

992
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:08,500
discussion or I think what will be

993
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:13,510
discussed this afternoon that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will let</font>

994
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:18,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">me affect asked so yes so the I I had a</font>

995
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:21,220
lively discussion with Benoit and my his

996
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,558
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me when I said do you want me</font>

997
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:26,078
to just wait until you decide what

998
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:28,569
you're going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not to wait and he</font>

999
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,420
would help us if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to refactor</font>

1000
00:51:28,569 --> 00:51:32,829
things in the subsequent version so

1001
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:37,119

commented on the list Ne<font color="#CCCCCC"> Biermann</font>

requirement 11 where we do not

1009
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:02,529
necessarily in fact it's a lot of maize

1010
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:04,900
there we the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data node may store the</font>

1011
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:08,890
client ID does not need to store the

1012
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:12,940
priority his comment is well if the

1013
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:14,859
priority can change for a client be it

1014
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:18,010
via triple-a and we only store the

1015
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:20,290
client ID then the priority could cause

1016
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:23,500
us to reevaluate what the the final

1017
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">state is the that client a is ephemeral</font>

bees he's suggesting we also require of

1020
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:35,950
the net comp working group that we store

priority in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to client ID I</font>

1022
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:40,299
haven't fully digested it I'm just

1023
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:42,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">bringing it up here unless a that we</font>

1024
00:52:40,299 --> 00:52:46,569
probably may want to revisit requirement

1025
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:49,200
11 i'll text in that having actually

1026
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:51,970
taken time to write the code for that I

1027
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,569
don't really think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it matters because it</font>

1028
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,910
really is a pointer to a

1029
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:58,660
particular set of client IDs and

1030
00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:02,740
priority where if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're storing it if</font>

1031
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:05,779
you're storing is set of essentially a

1032
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:07,939
transaction session ID that is created

1033
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:12,590
out of your just pointing one to the

1034
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:15,350
other it's I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see having actually</font>

1035
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:17,750
taken the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time early on to write that</font>

1036
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:20,390
code knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd sort of need to know I</font>

1037
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:23,390
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see where he's coming from but I'm</font>

1038
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:25,759
glad to engage him on the list yes okay

1039
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:28,250
because you're it's just a pointer right

1040
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:34,790
it's a pointer to one or the other do

1041
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:40,220
you have a comment believe sorry oh yeah

1042
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:44,830
let's just as an individual so we've

1043
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:48,470
been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this circle before and a</font>

1044
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:51,710
piece of the discussion was if the

1045
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:53,720
priority changes for a client do we go

1046
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:55,580
back and apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> that priority to</font>

1047
00:53:53,720 --> 00:54:00,799
everything the client has previously

1048
00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:04,250
said and my understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of</font>

1049
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,590
the discussion was no no it's a change

1050
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:08,300
and you take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for new pieces coming</font>

1051
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:11,540
forward but you're not going back and

1052
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:14,650
reapplying we also put in the

1053
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:18,560
simplification as your recall in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prague</font>

1054
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:20,270
about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year ago the reason we had a</font>

1055
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,400
discussion about maybe you can can you

1056
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:26,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">just or client ID instead of client ID</font>

1057
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:32,690
and priority was to simplify and to let

1058
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:40,640
the overlaying panes of glass approach

1059
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:43,940
work more easily I obviously discussion

1060
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,379
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it might have changed but we're so</font>

1061
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,110
close<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just finishing this stuff it</font>

1062
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,430
would be really nice not to reopen

1063
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:52,150
discussions we've had unless there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1064
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:55,810
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> strong I changing consensus</font>

1065
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:58,850
having looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the code and doing this</font>

1066
00:54:55,810 --> 00:55:01,759
what you really I don't want to reopen

1067
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:05,870
11<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless the working group strongly</font>

1068
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,190
encourages me to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I agree</font>

1069
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:09,950
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the a B</font>

1070
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:14,030
notjust does just me oh yeah oh yeah no

1071
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:16,879
idea the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in reality what</font>

1072
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:18,260
you're talking about is if you say that

1073
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,200
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back and reevaluate</font>

1074
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:24,500
it the most efficient way if you do

1075
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,049
route tables is to consider the priority

1076
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,849
to change a route change that goes

1077
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:32,930
across all the pieces which you would

1078
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:38,950
probably set up a change list and walk

1079
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:42,200
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it anyway it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really just the</font>

1080
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:43,848
standard changing the requirement

1081
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,578
doesn't require change what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1082
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:50,869
to do and it really makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a little</font>

1083
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:52,790
less clear how a rock table works but

1084
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:56,210
that's that's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's sooo</font>

1085
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:58,819
talking is implement or not chair right

1086
00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:01,460
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> for if you think about the I</font>

1087
00:55:58,819 --> 00:56:03,710
to RS agent handling the priority then

1088
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,150
figure out to communicate down to

1089
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:09,410
whether it's to the red bandage or other

1090
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:13,670
things I what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you described requires</font>

1091
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:15,319
significant that's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

1092
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,970
solution that's just for the red manager

1093
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:23,690
for implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's correct</font>

1094
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:26,299
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one example okay we'll</font>

1095
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably have to confirm we'll start</font>

1096
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:31,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">with what we have and then go on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

the final working group all but I will

1098
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:36,319
look again Joe any questions you can

1099
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:38,660
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean I tried to give you my</font>

1100
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:45,319
personal answer but not the working

1101

<font color="#E5E5E5">group chair answer ok ok any other</font>

1102
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:50,029
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should think about</font>

specifically on the requirements or the

to help us do a better job with the

implementations

1110
