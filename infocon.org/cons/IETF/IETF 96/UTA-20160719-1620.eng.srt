130
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:08,540
record on the mail delivery domain which

131
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:12,260
says I support SDS we have a https

132
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,510
endpoint with the policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> describing when</font>

133
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,329
you expect TLS connections to this

134
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,529
domain and what senders should sort of

135
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:20,989
look for in the MX and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

136

<font color="#E5E5E5">chesty s so we use web geek a validation</font>

138
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,380
so certain violations based on a trusted

139
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,089
certificate authority we enforce this by

140
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,380
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> caching the policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a long</font>

141

these soft deployments and report

00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:47,089
failures but not actually bounce mail

148

until we're sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable that</font>

149
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:52,399
things work next slide please so between

150
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last draft and the current one we</font>

151
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,649
made I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think three significant changes</font>

152
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,640
the first is that we split out reporting

153
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,899
we thought that that was sort of

154
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,579
generally useful and the people who

155
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,140
didn't implement STS might still benefit

156
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,750
from reporting either because they want

157
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,860
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about TLS failures with start</font>

158
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,050
TLS or because they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about</font>

159
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dane failures or just sort of a general</font>

160
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,699
useful thing that's now its own txt

161
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,010
record which just describes where to

162
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,579
send failures and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jen there can be a</font>

163
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:21,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">male to link or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not John there can be</font>

164
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:23,089
hplink instead so you can report out of

165
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">band you know upload a report sort of</font>

166
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:29,449
like HP KP supports and say essentially

167
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:31,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">what what MX is you talk to what</font>

168
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:33,920
failures you saw and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of provide</font>

169
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,930
general stats there I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

170
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,040
largely I controversial and I'm actually

171
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,319
not going to spend that much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

172
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,290
on TLS rpt because I think it's

173
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,279
extremely simple and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of general</font>

174
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,560
useful second change we

175
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,730
essentially simplify the tax records to

176
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">the point of the text record and our</font>

177
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,790
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal was it how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to copy the</font>

178
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,459
proposal but because we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> assuming</font>

179
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,248
the MS sec it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just a</font>

180
00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:00,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">contestar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a copy of the policy which</font>

181
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,850
serves just to indicate which version of

182
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,230
policy you should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

183
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,999
you should look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> https endpoint</font>

184
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,199
and so we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMS is sort of a</font>

185
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:08,180
signaling layer and so we've simplified

186
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:10,248
this to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it clear that you actually</font>

187
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,219
can't rely on the DMS record it's just a

188
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:14,389
copy of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an ID that uniquely</font>

189
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,949
identifies the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of the</font>

190
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:17,660
policy you want to get the policy you go

191
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:20,180
to the HPS endpoint so this was

192
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:23,089
discussed also on<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list I don't</font>

193
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,819
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's usually controversial the the</font>

194
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:27,350
third<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is we had sort of previously</font>

195
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:31,189
had this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think somewhat hacked up</font>

196
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:33,350
effort to sort of coexist with DNS SEC

197
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:37,189
for sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of validating to the DNS</font>

198
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,110
records and Dane for authenticating MX's

199
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:41,269
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it caused a lot of problems</font>

200
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,870
both in terms of extra complexity and in

201
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,370
terms of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the lack of clarity on</font>

202
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,170
what to do if like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the recipient</font>

203
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,569
domain has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dane policy which doesn't</font>

204
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,449
validate and yes yes policy said rely on

205
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dane and do report only mode so this is</font>

206
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:56,029
sort of an odd scenario where if you

207
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,829
look at dane only you would fail the

208
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:00,860
message but if you look at sts you might

209
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:02,750
be less clear and so we basically just

210
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,360
wholesale<font color="#CCCCCC"> eliminate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DFS sec from the</font>

211
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,879
proposal<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think now it's sort of more</font>

212
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,259
clearly an alternative and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think they</font>

213
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,439
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> coexist I think there's no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

214
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:14,089
downside to implementing both but you

215
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:15,680
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're now separate and I</font>

216
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:16,970
think it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes things a lot simpler</font>

217
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,180
so those are the three significant

218
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,250
changes next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please and we closed</font>

219
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,949
a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other issues between drops to</font>

220
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,750
zero and Jeff 01 I think largely

221
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:28,609
syntactic so as we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> going along</font>

222
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,709
actually implementing this on our sides

223
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,259
we've discovered cases where things

224
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:35,569
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> their specified or like the ABM f</font>

225
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,610
is incorrect because a<font color="#E5E5E5"> be enough is hard</font>

226
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:39,019
or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this and and</font>

227
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,459
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of made a bunch of like</font>

228
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:43,389
as you can sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of see here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

229
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:47,388
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide as well uh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well please</font>

230
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:49,279
a bunch of sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> minor syntax changes</font>

231
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:53,029
which i think don't change the semantics

232
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,649
heavily and so that's that's more or

233
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,760
less<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been tracking the open</font>

234
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:59,850
issues on the

235
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,280
might this can place particular me to

236
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,460
meet echo about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you threw out</font>

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mine yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and also the fuzz it's</font>

238
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,800
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of focus sorry you had you</font>

239
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,040
heard nothing I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

240
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,900
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah oh he was saying the mic wasn't</font>

241
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,120
working so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of that and also</font>

242
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,770
that the it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of out of focus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font>

243
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,460
the neck on the other slide it was

244
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,900
particularly bad on the remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

245
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,440
for people in the remote I think the

246
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,030
slides I available right online<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and</font>

247
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,560
the screen shots were just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

248
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,829
screen shots at the github issues list

249
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,660
and I think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who visit</font>

250
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:40,590
this URL can sort of see that the recent

251
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,969
progress but so that's that's like

252
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,080
though really I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I spent five</font>

253
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,370
minutes right that's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the five</font>

254
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,620
minute summary of sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we did</font>

255
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,260
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last update at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ittf 95 I</font>

256
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,670
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing hugely surprising except</font>

257
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,740
for those sort of three fairly

258
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:56,060
significant changes we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some open</font>

259
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,230
questions which I think are also sort of

260
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,270
again the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not changing the</font>

261
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,010
semantics dramatically not changing the

262
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of deployment behavior dramatically</font>

263
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,020
but maybe some some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

264
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,580
stylistic questions the first is really

265
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,640
this this discussion of like the nested

266
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,710
sub-domain versus a single subdomain for

267
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,470
hosting the policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we were kind of</font>

268
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,330
worried on the one hand about being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

269
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use like a wild card that example</font>

270
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:24,180
that org domain signature certificate to

271
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,480
sign the policy versus like the risk of

272
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,000
say dine<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS or tumblr people who host</font>

273
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,100
untrusted subdomains having you know

274
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,370
persistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> service by somebody hosting a</font>

275
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,810
policy that's not legitimate so this was

276
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,720
kind of one discussion we had whether we

277
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:44,250
should host the HTTPS end point at you

278
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:47,490
know policy mt st s dot example that org

279
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,440
versus just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a one-level sub domain</font>

280
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think we had some questions on the</font>

281
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,660
mailing list about how smart hosting

282
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,820
should work to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me as victors nodding</font>

283
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,620
so to me smart hosting is sort of you

284
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,200
know you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the policy of the</font>

285
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,790
smart host domain not the not the

286
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,740
original destination demand you're

287
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,030
rewriting that the domain but this is

288
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of the kind of operational stuff</font>

289
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,600
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think maybe doesn't require</font>

290
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,220
normative specifications

291
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,279
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a little bit unclear in the</font>

292
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,290
spec today similarly<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the assets</font>

293
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,490
should we allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> hvs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> redirect side policy</font>

294
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,689
location so again we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of didn't</font>

295
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,920
specify this I think it's quite

296
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,660
reasonable obviously you shouldn't be

297
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,529
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to redirect from https to http</font>

298
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:29,170
because that has no value but sort of a

299
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:30,189
reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> question and then we had sort</font>

300
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,319
of a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> about where the dot</font>

301
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,050
well-known policy should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and sort of</font>

302
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it makes the plugin easier so those</font>

303
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,380
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the four things I can think</font>

304
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,230
of recently which are sort of like

305
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:45,970
likely to change your sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of noticeably</font>

306
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:47,829
going to change and and then in terms of

307
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:51,370
current efforts so the Google policy is

308
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:53,290
live<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we expect send time validation</font>

309
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,720
and logging and you know eventually

310
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,759
enforcement if it works sometime this

311
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,009
quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft I think the policy is</font>

endpoint has the wrong certificate right

316
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,959
now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be fixed by shortly</font>

317
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,540
and report only mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> is planned yahoo</font>

318
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,189
report only mode is planned one in one I

319
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,050
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> report only Motors plant for a</font>

320
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:19,329
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of domains this summer so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we sort</font>

321
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,769
of know of a handful of big deployments

322
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:22,689
most of them are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who contributed</font>

323
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:24,189
to the draft which I think report only

324
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,389
mode will happen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the near future for</font>

325
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:27,730
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people enforcement will happen</font>

326
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:29,769
a little bit further<font color="#CCCCCC"> off I don't know of</font>

327
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,529
other other deployments but there might

328
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:35,949
be some and that's basically the status

329
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,449
one more slide so TLS rpt just to sort

330
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:41,680
of cover that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was also</font>

331
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:43,959
specific topic here<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes yeah I kind of</font>

332
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,050
think maybe we will stop here and take

333
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,849
questions clarifications and and hear

334
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">from you what would you like from the</font>

335
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:55,329
working group to do and particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

336
00:16:51,430 --> 00:17:01,870
we go to the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of open questions it's</font>

337
00:16:55,329 --> 00:17:04,389
free yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> deck right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah this one can</font>

338
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:08,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually go one more forward it's</font>

339
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:12,030
very Reba I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't easily this is Barry</font>

340
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:15,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">liebe the I see this is a no the next</font>

341
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,270
yeah I see this as nice list I see it

342
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,169
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing there's no</font>

343
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,429
implementation section in the document I

344
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:23,199
suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put that in so that</font>

345
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:24,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">when the document is reviewed everyone</font>

346
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,670
can see

347
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:30,610
the running code that's out there you do

348
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:33,070
you mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> C code that on github or</font>

349
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,389
something no no no see see who is

350
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,370
actually working on was implementing

351
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:41,470
this there's a what yeah there's a

352
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,750
there's a document that used to be an

353
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">experimental now it's bcp that suggests</font>

354
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,020
them we put implementation section<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

355
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,610
implementation considerations or

356
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,440
implementation report or whatever it's

357
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:54,370
called and I suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

358
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,960
yeah that makes sense hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Jim Fenton</font>

359
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:59,489
what deployment is there beyond

360
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:03,010
publications<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Records EG and mtas so</font>

361
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,770
in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> centime validation I mean we</font>

362
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:07,120
at Google we anticipate<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have sent</font>

363
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,370
I'm validation working this quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

364
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,169
think a number of other sort of

365
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,060
co-authors and partners expect to have

366
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,470
maybe offline report only

367
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,290
implementations like this summer this

368
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,320
quarter I think one reasonable question

369
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,360
would be when and whether we'll have an

370
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,389
implementation in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open source MTA</font>

371
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,729
like post fix that people can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

372
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,440
would actually like to contribute open

373
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:36,520
source code that does validation but I

374
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:39,330
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> notify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time to do that so so</font>

375
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,680
I'm postfix probably nothing before

376
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,620
Victor company inputs it's probably

377
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:47,830
nothing before the spec is finalized um

378
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,330
and perhaps even though the outline you

379
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,360
know that very high level<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec is</font>

380
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:56,169
not too bad the details need a great

381
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,090
deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work so if we think that oh one</font>

382
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,620
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> near a final draft I think we'll see</font>

383
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:04,510
probably in 05 before it's really done

384
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,550
one obvious example that actually we

385
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,140
neglected to pay attention to is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

386
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:11,169
the ID field probably needs multiple

387
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:14,650
values<font color="#E5E5E5"> um otherwise you can't do roll</font>

388
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:16,930
over if ID is reliably so weeks this is

389
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,900
this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous slide</font>

390
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,430
question right work so Nico suggestion

391
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,430
around this was actually just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a move the</font>

392
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,690
hosting to the ID in the URI and that

393
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,020
way you can sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do roll over easily</font>

394
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,460
but but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

395
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same as you you know because if you</font>

396
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:37,309
introduce a new policy there is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font>

397
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:41,059
in DNS caches an ID that matches it um

398
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:42,769
and when people retrieve the policy the

399
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">IDS won't match they'll keep recruiting</font>

400
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,980
the policy over and over again but their

401
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:48,590
cash will say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the wrong ID and</font>

402
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,799
we can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that offline um so the</font>

403
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,860
ID field needs revision uh the entire

404
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:57,320
future section is either impractical or

405
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,379
irrelevant needs to be deleted<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we're</font>

406
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,450
gonna get discussed that on the list uh

407
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:04,519
the state machine is under specified

408
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,429
needs to be expanded to take into

409
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">account multiple amex hosts ah there's</font>

410
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:11,360
some editorial issues about just how the

411
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:13,879
motivation in terms of comparisons of

412
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,229
dana and this that not so much by

413
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,879
advocating for Dave I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

414
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,559
clarification<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee some of the</font>

415
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:20,689
descriptions are low ah yeah I mean it's

416
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so no a bunch of work like that the</font>

417
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,330
state machine in the the sort of

418
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,259
deployment issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I focus on</font>

419
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,080
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think those are the ones where</font>

420
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:28,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can really tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us you know as I've</font>

421
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,549
said earlier I think these are issues

422
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:32,809
where you're likely to discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

423
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:35,090
different implementation issues and we

424
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,440
are certainly I think I think the normal

425
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,809
usage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> postfix looks very different</font>

426
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,509
than the normal deployment of an mga at

427
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,070
Google um and I I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily have</font>

428
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:48,049
as much insight as you do in to sort of

429
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:50,240
the former so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd rather not do</font>

430
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:51,799
four more revisions before I get all the

431
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,990
postfix feedback I'd actually rather get

432
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,740
the feedback sooner if it's possible

433
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,019
that doesn't mean you have to implement

434
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,749
it and tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us what we're being stupid</font>

435
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,100
about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know now but like I do think</font>

436
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:03,200
the sooner that we have that working

437
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,119
open source implementation in sort of

438
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,169
smaller deployments the sooner we would

439
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:11,928
get that feedback and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wouldn't have</font>

440
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:14,330
to do the four more revisions right<font color="#CCCCCC"> dan</font>

441
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:16,519
York internet study so it just can you

442
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,830
just talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> me through the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dane the</font>

443
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:21,619
coexistence that you mentioned right so

444
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">um we don't make any real statements i</font>

445
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,320
mean i think aside from sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

446
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:25,610
mention as<font color="#E5E5E5"> victor saying that there are</font>

448
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,330
make any say for sure how it should

449
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,610
relate the the the coexistence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font>

450
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,100
would imagine is you know onsen time you

451
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,809
can certainly validate both<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

452
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,490
hit the discussion in the manual about

453
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,559
you know potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you validate</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dane you don't bother as a sender to</font>

455
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:44,869
validate SDS which i think is quite

456
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:45,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasonable sure i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really ok think</font>

457
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:47,209
we need to make a statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but</font>

458
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,919
it's sort of if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending mail you</font>

459
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,230
obviously can check one and say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

460
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,000
know dmsx checks out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably good</font>

461
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright if there's becomes more of a</font>

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,690
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision that the ascending MTN</font>

463
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,219
rice so I think it's same time it's a

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:02,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy decision time credits any MTA we</font>

465
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:05,750
can certainly wait wait so not in

00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,870
victory Specter<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got we got remote</font>

467
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:11,179
people so sorry um sts downgrades the

468
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,949
security of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane so if it's a kind of</font>

469
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,990
more ubiquitous but less secure option

470
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,240
if then existed really needs to be

471
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,100
authoritative<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think the way I</font>

472
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,410
saw it I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a hurry so</font>

473
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,969
I missing something the way I saw it if

474
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,610
your ass and the MTA you might

475
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,530
reasonably say if sts fails fail the

476
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:33,049
message if they in fails fail a message

477
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:37,160
which i think would be reasonable if

478
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:38,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">stss soft fail ah you exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that</font>

479
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,610
was exactly my point earlier with why we

480
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,659
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dane references</font>

481
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,939
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that the way we had it</font>

482
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,919
before was this sort of bad state

483
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">Victor's talking about where we said if</font>

484
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,600
sts says soft fail but authenticate the

485
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,950
thing like what what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do you</font>

486
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,649
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have circumventing game so we</font>

487
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,880
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think now it's as</font>

488
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,830
you were saying it's essentially a

489
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,179
sender policy questions as a senator of

490
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,549
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do if I were validating</font>

491
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:03,530
both Dane and SDS is I would fail if you

492
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:05,510
do one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them fails as a recipient you</font>

493
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,889
can certainly publish both you may not

494
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:12,650
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might want to I don't know</font>

495
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:16,820
ok thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah okay many more comments</font>

496
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:19,910
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> can walk you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the oven issues</font>

497
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,010
more but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think there's certain data so</font>

498
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,200
unless right so what we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

499
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,379
here what I heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the others</font>

500
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're trying to do is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get as much</font>

501
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:33,740
as possible feedback from the

502
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:35,720
implementers in in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to polish</font>

503
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,500
basically the text and the protocol and

504
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,110
the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> m and as you so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies</font>

505
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,750
are implementing it and so it would be

506
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:52,189
great to get this feedback you know as

507
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:53,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">soon as possible and instead from mark</font>

508
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,460
richard do any the attendees know of

509
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:57,910
other implementations beyond those over

510
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,910
on the slide

511
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:11,730
time's up someone's oh sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah um oh</font>

512
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:13,200
yeah sorry which<font color="#E5E5E5"> one can see oh yeah is</font>

513
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">there it Oh is there an exit</font>

514
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,100
implementation underway there is an exit

515
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,990
mental I can't read there is an exit

516
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:28,080
implementation on the way to attendees

517
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:32,850
know of any other implementations<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hexham</font>

518
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,049
I've heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah yeah I mean I</font>

519
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,480
think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know marks saying the same</font>

520
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:38,010
thing we would much rather have some

521
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,210
working open source implementation that

522
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,740
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could get some feedback from and I</font>

523
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,789
think I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that's really</font>

524
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,049
obviously missing from our perspective

525
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:45,690
is just what it looks like to be

526
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:47,760
deploying post fix your XM for a small

527
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,889
domain where you have maybe a backup MX

528
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,799
by somebody else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guts</font>

529
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:54,090
of things i'd really like to invite

530
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,908
people to sort of do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and give us</font>

531
00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:03,000
feedback earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm looking specific</font>

532
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:04,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">victor so post six we tend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to not</font>

533
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,519
implement anything that can't be done

534
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:10,049
one hundred percent right<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh so it'll</font>

535
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,860
take a while for us to be convinced<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

536
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:13,168
this can be done one hundred percent

537
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,570
right in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular you know the</font>

538
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:18,809
timeouts for HTTP are under specified

539
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:20,399
here what our recommendations there and

540
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,350
the like so lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pin</font>

541
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:24,149
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to be convinced that it</font>

542
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,830
scales with positional they are

543
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,629
conditions are right i mean for examples

544
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,070
like that should we have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

545
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,149
shouldn't have normative specifications

546
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,820
for what the time that should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be free</font>

547
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:34,649
smtp specifies normative well sorry

548
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are commended timeouts at least</font>

549
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:38,729
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember whether it's a master or</font>

550
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,789
should perhaps it's a should but it's

551
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,460
still normative smtp space says that 300

552
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:47,190
seconds at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> for mail from recipient</font>

553
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,100
to and so on timeouts 604 you know dot

554
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:53,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Norman</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be that</font>

555
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,019
specific on yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that one can</font>

556
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,220
reasonably understand what the

557
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,399
expectations are in the sending and

558
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,820
receiving side the the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

559
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:04,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that my experience with Exim is that</font>

560
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,289
they tend to stop short of dotting all

561
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,149
the i's and crossing all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> t's so they</font>

562
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:11,490
have a day and implementation but it's

563
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:13,789
been incomplete uh and they think

564
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're done but you know not entirely</font>

565
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:17,370
even though i donated code to them they

566
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,890
haven't finished the

567
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,050
for integration yet um so exit may be

568
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,430
done but it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be secure yet you</font>

569
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:26,370
know who<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows I'm sorry to shame them</font>

570
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:28,559
in public<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit but uh you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

571
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,760
that that's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how it goes so you</font>

572
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,470
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really done until</font>

573
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,000
somebody's reviewed it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

574
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,260
who's gonna do yeah I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean I do</font>

575
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're circling around this issue</font>

576
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,670
of like how to get the feedback that's

577
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,820
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of detailed feedback right but</font>

578
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:45,000
this is Barry liebe so wait there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

579
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:49,678
six documents defining HTTP and how it

580
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,080
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are you really saying that you</font>

581
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,050
want this document to give that kind of

582
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,720
HTTP detail I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

583
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:59,820
appropriate I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this points to those</font>

584
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,179
and say that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do HTTP and</font>

585
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:06,540
here's how you do this with HTTP but

586
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:08,820
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Victor again but if I'm blocking on</font>

587
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:12,780
an HTTP request in the middle of an

588
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:15,030
email transaction then I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

589
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,850
some notion as to what's appropriate in

590
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,860
this space<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what time</font>

591
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">adds HTTP does or doesn't specify maybe</font>

592
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:25,080
it leaves the issue entirely open but if

593
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,030
I'm to have a scalable MTA I need to

594
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,189
know what's expected of me because the

595
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,050
person provisioning the HTTP

596
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,730
infrastructure might plan it for a

597
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,470
certain scale and might expect people to

598
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:38,010
wait a certain amount before<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get</font>

599
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:40,320
serviced and they ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

600
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,210
they should monitor for responses within

601
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,678
the certain budget that they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> sierra</font>

602
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,860
commands or else you know email will

603
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,920
start breaking um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> MTA's you know</font>

604
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,510
with limited concurrency<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacific's price</font>

605
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,700
not overwhelm the machine it's running

606
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:56,550
on it runs within a second currency like

607
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,559
very right but if the agency gets out of

608
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,790
whack we can't deliver mail to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

609
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,110
mean these are these are all like really

610
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:03,270
reasonable implementation comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

611
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,800
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sort of i am sort of surprised</font>

612
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:07,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would want to go to that level</font>

613
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,240
of specificity about yeah things like I

614
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:11,220
mean we take for granted that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

615
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,410
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a working secure h2 guess client</font>

616
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:17,190
because you know you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

617
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:19,830
write and like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think specifying that</font>

618
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,970
level of details sort of not not totally

619
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,470
appealing to me both because yeah I

620
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,270
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RFC's just for that already</font>

621
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,420
and because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a whole value</font>

622
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,670
proposition of what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

623
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,020
can already but get URL lib<font color="#CCCCCC"> telat eval</font>

624
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:35,000
it certificates and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not</font>

625
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:37,320
about it right hopefully maybe maybe not

626
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,540
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I think I think this is like</font>

627
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,950
a reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> question if you're sending</font>

628
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">compose fix and you want to know how</font>

629
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,260
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> should lock but that seems sort of</font>

630
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,390
to me like something that you would just

631
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,010
as your you know as the postfix<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

632
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:53,490
you would sort of like figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out yeah</font>

633
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:55,770
being optimistic so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh what</font>

634
00:28:53,490 --> 00:29:00,450
I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with Victor on is that if</font>

635
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:04,830
you find that the normal way HTTP is

636
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:07,740
used isn't sufficient for this then it

637
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,300
probably is reasonable to say for this

638
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,750
environment here are different

639
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,700
parameters that you need to use but I

640
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,500
think before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go sticking that in the</font>

641
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,450
document we need to have some idea that

642
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,220
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really necessary for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> K</font>

643
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,720
and we wouldn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case I mean as</font>

644
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,180
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the value</font>

645
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,180
proposition is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that I think</font>

646
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great it seems like we had very</font>

647
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,720
discussion fluid seems we didn't know

648
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,149
discussion to follow on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list it</font>

649
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,210
would like to ask actually who in the

650
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,310
audience how to judge how many people in

651
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:47,910
the audience actually read this latest

652
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:51,330
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay actually it's sword yeah at</font>

653
00:29:47,910 --> 00:30:03,930
least sort of the audience great that's

654
00:29:51,330 --> 00:30:05,490
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> aim yes yes so so this was about</font>

655
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:09,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft the second draft is</font>

656
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:13,710
about reporting in which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one</font>

657
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,970
side up and do i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say more than</font>

658
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,540
this i mean i think i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

659
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:20,190
reporting is very simple and like i said

660
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:27,080
i sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of expect mostly on controversial</font>

661
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:29,790
um we get a comment from curt anderson

662
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,010
normal what's normal for interactive web

663
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,920
traffic is not necessarily normal that

664
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:37,560
the needs for<font color="#CCCCCC"> high performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> MTA so is</font>

665
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:41,070
that true i think web web latency is

666
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">user facing and mail send latency is not</font>

667
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:48,990
really user-facing so

668
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:50,760
is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said something hearty</font>

669
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,440
actually what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to point out</font>

670
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is that they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a bunch</font>

671
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,190
of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployment considerations</font>

672
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:58,529
that will be different<font color="#E5E5E5"> in different</font>

673
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:01,740
environments so for example in a case

674
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:02,850
where you have a long-lived HTTP

675
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,120
connection where you're going to use the

676
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:08,719
keepall I parameter there's a timeout

677
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:12,299
associated with that where you can tell

678
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,679
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> party how long the</font>

679
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:16,230
connection should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> available for you</font>

680
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">can always keep it open longer that</font>

681
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,940
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the case in all of these</font>

682
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,970
connections right that you you have a

683
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:27,899
persistent connection available I think

684
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:32,010
specifying it for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> mta's in all</font>

685
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:35,580
deployments would be startling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font>

686
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:37,889
have some advice that says hey please

687
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,418
please consider this in making the

688
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:41,039
engineering trade-offs of how your how

689
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,289
long you're willing to wait if you've

690
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a very high performance MTA you</font>

691
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:48,330
might wait a shorter amount of time

692
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:51,230
before moving moving on then if you've

693
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:53,279
got a one that basically got a

694
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:55,919
persistent connection to one or a very

695
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,779
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of hosts writing that is</font>

696
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,190
deployment considerations with the

697
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,100
engineering trade-offs for different

698
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:05,059
conditions makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

699
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:09,629
standardizing on on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular set</font>

700
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:12,149
would be surprising behavior this is

701
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:16,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">very yes what Ted said and in response</font>

702
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:18,059
to yeah something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's user-facing you</font>

703
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,129
want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quick but the user can</font>

704
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:23,010
tolerate a few second delay before he

705
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,870
sees something when<font color="#E5E5E5"> your MTA has to</font>

706
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,059
transmit a million messages a minute you

707
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,229
can't tolerate a few second to last sure

708
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,990
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if you were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the</font>

709
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you know a different domain /</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">message which I mean which could happen</font>

711
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:38,850
I think it would be potentially very

712
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,949
expensive even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if one look up delays you</font>

713
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,928
buy a few seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've started to</font>

00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">build up a cute it may take you a while</font>

715
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:48,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write yeah I mean agree with that I</font>

716
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,590
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think two questions about this</font>

717
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,549
one is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this goes a bit to the</font>

718
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,840
comment of you know these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different</font>

719
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:54,120
trade-offs<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different deployments I</font>

720
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,649
think it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hard to to say sort of</font>

721
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,580
normatively what what trade-off you

722
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:58,439
should make

723
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,590
I guess the other question I have is is

724
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,260
is this a situation where the policy

725
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,760
host needs to be understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

726
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,250
trade-off on part of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of most</font>

727
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,379
senders like it is it the case that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

728
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,330
deploy my policy on a relatively slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> H</font>

729
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to BSN point it will be a big problem</font>

730
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:16,230
for people who have a short message you

731
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,120
know can't tolerate a long message to

732
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,980
and if that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then yet maybe we</font>

733
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,360
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say take this into consideration</font>

734
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,950
people may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have trouble delivering</font>

735
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:33,178
dinner to your domain if the policy

736
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:35,580
fetch takes a while Ted<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gandi I</font>

737
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:37,500
absolutely agree that taking into

738
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">account on both sides of it is perfectly</font>

739
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,639
reasonable we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to acknowledge</font>

740
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,639
that the system must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at least</font>

741
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:46,379
reasonably robust to delay simply

742
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:49,529
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're there are delays built</font>

743
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:54,149
into the layer below<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP I mean the</font>

744
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:55,830
layer below<font color="#CCCCCC"> comma DCP and there there's</font>

745
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:57,239
always the possibility that after you've

746
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the TCP handshake you get something</font>

747
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a routing change that that causes</font>

748
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">this to take longer than you expect</font>

749
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:07,139
right so the reasonable amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

750
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,179
robustness to variation in this is also

751
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:12,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has to have and</font>

752
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:14,869
I think describing what what the

753
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,919
variations can be is useful in making

754
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:18,480
making people aware of what the

755
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:21,118
engineering traders are but really

756
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,409
demanding it of of the internet system

757
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:28,080
is not going to work well sorry or it

758
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:29,339
specifically asked about TLS report one

759
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,929
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that a piece of what should go</font>

760
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:34,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your last report is currently still</font>

761
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:37,740
in the SDS spec draft and that is the

762
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,960
registrations off the deep things are

763
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:41,750
really report specific they're living in

764
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wrong draft at the moment yeah</font>

765
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:47,250
there's a section<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

766
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:49,320
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in the STS draft that's</font>

767
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,210
really a whole bunch of verbs or

768
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,210
attributes whatever that<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe</font>

769
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:55,889
failure modes that really belong in the

770
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:59,670
reporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the hottest yes but</font>

771
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:01,589
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ah so no longer remember this I</font>

772
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,540
yeah I can't certificate we had made an

773
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:04,830
effort to sort of generalize the errors

774
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,599
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the points</font>

775
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,549
here sweet I think originally said oh we

776
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:10,410
can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a taxonomy of ways in</font>

777
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,940
which TLS connections fail and then

778
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,348
have a nice sort of schema here and we

779
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">realized you sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of can't do that and</font>

780
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:16,140
you can sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do it for openssl in</font>

781
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:17,730
general cases cuz a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

782
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,920
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can't really do this in the</font>

783
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,809
general case I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I mean so you</font>

784
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,549
have specific things they wait so long

785
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:24,930
in the report draft just move over we

786
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:26,069
were in kinds of things it might be an

787
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,950
editorial air because we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of maybe</font>

788
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:31,920
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think mostly to remove as I</font>

789
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:35,730
recall<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remove sort of specifics I'm</font>

790
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,980
in sosua it's good I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm okay no</font>

791
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,900
thanks go there it needs to move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

792
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,270
other is to maybe finish off the topic

793
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,450
the main reason I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

794
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:46,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">time outs is that if they're long</font>

795
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,990
recommended to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> by default you know</font>

796
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,359
you be generous to the HTTP server that

797
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:53,578
might change the design in terms of

798
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,130
whether you recommend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the MTA</font>

799
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">proceed to send and you know fresh</font>

800
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,940
policy in the background and you know

801
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,649
later this was my question sure messages

802
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,660
might benefit from the policy but the

803
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">one you're currently sending just excess</font>

804
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,160
a probe to trigger it or whether in fact

805
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,960
the current should blog but then<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

806
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,450
message stalls for they recommended

807
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,299
duration these issues always remastered

808
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it matters insofar as it changes</font>

809
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:19,710
design decisions by the policy host

810
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,598
change some decisions around the sender

811
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,549
as you were describing and I think it

812
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of worth describing how we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expect</font>

813
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:29,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen that two recent consensus</font>

814
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,660
enter yeah John Levine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS reporting</font>

815
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,680
stuff is still kind of under specified

816
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:36,569
like if you say MIT's like it says if it

817
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,770
says mail to you says mail it but you're

818
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed to like send the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON in the</font>

819
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,170
body of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message or is it an</font>

820
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,270
attachment or is it a compressed

821
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,900
attachment like it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D mark and the</font>

822
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:47,640
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I we understand this is</font>

823
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,859
not the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as d mark but in d mark</font>

824
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,660
third parties collecting reports turned

825
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:53,460
out to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> really useful which meant that</font>

826
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,799
you needed some way to publish the fact

827
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,359
that domain a is willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get reported</font>

828
00:36:55,799 --> 00:37:00,059
domain be so you need to stick that in

829
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,078
yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've read this it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font>

830
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:03,390
think we left it out cuz it's

831
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,980
complicated like but doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the exact</font>

832
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,819
same way as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark is reasonable and</font>

833
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,160
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of has the right security</font>

834
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:14,430
trade-offs I think so it turns out not

835
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:17,129
to be that complicated so so I don't see

836
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:20,308
any any people at the mic and so I will

837
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:23,279
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of summarize the points and</font>

838
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:26,390
tell me if it's correct

839
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:30,150
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one it seems to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font>

840
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:33,779
there is a lot of a tuning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters</font>

841
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:36,359
that is is going to be I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will</font>

842
00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:38,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done and probably this is</font>

843
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:40,499
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be based even on my</font>

844
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:44,269
implementation experience going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

845
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:51,029
but basically that's that's one area in

846
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:54,689
and what else<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I think regarding</font>

847
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:56,279
that like I'm I I am NOT still entirely

848
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,538
sure how to proceed in the sense that

849
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:59,880
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think some of that will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

850
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:01,769
implementation dependent and some of

851
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">that like the degree of specificity I</font>

852
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:05,669
think we're not all idle I don't know

853
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think Victor wants to be more</font>

854
00:38:05,669 --> 00:38:09,118
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I do for example um and</font>

855
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,209
I'm should've not sure quite where the

856
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,309
metal gathers their rights I think some

857
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:16,979
of that is so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's all it's</font>

858
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:19,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of um you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's two</font>

859
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:21,629
issues one is the tuning of parameters

860
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:23,640
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other one is the specificity of</font>

861
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:27,239
state machine and stuff and actually

862
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,339
explain how it all works and then so

863
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,859
this to kind of be discussing identified

864
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:34,589
do you see any additional issues that

865
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:36,929
you would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get that you are stuck</font>

866
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:39,269
with basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as the team of</font>

867
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:42,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">autumn's that you would like feedback</font>

868
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:45,589
for or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have enough homework sort of</font>

869
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:47,969
looking my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god it isn't me I think no um</font>

870
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:51,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your will discover stuff as we</font>

871
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:53,039
implement but not at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

872
00:38:51,150 --> 00:39:00,109
and you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do have enough</font>

873
00:38:53,039 --> 00:39:00,109
homework to do put an excavation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

874
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:08,308
Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew</font>

875
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:12,299
you know there's a set of tasks related

876
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:15,079
to aligning mua and<font color="#E5E5E5"> MTA sts I'll talk</font>

877
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:19,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">about those more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> main presentation but</font>

878
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:22,349
uh I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on the hook to review the</font>

879
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:23,849
the reporting's back in detail to make

880
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:27,410
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it applies to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both protocols</font>

881
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:32,549
so keep me<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the hook for that</font>

882
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:33,839
absolutely will do dan York and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

883
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:36,509
read the draft and<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking through that</font>

884
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,239
I just I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think as I looked at this</font>

885
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:41,249
before but now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm seeing again you're</font>

886
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:43,559
still relying on trust and first use

887
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:45,118
right you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still yeah it is still some</font>

888
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,219
mechanism that the attacker could

889
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,999
disrupt that before they get to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

890
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:52,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you're still I think the security</font>

891
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:54,808
considerations could spell that out

892
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:57,538
maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that term because we're</font>

893
00:39:54,809 --> 00:40:00,539
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know within the space of</font>

894
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:02,579
that I saw the future work pieces we're

895
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:06,239
looking at how to mitigate it out or how

896
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:07,650
to do that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some way um okay yeah it's</font>

897
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,989
it's I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's exactly the</font>

898
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,579
same semantics<font color="#E5E5E5"> shs deals for example</font>

899
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:13,440
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I think I think we'd be happy</font>

900
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,209
for example one very easy thing that we

901
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,160
could do sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of off the bat is like a</font>

902
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:18,390
pre-loaded list which i think is is

903
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,729
reasonable you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know have a have a</font>

904
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:23,430
bundled set of policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ship with</font>

905
00:40:20,729 --> 00:40:25,019
your MTA right<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer-term we sort of</font>

906
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:27,419
describe things you know public<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

907
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:29,308
pinning<font color="#CCCCCC"> serve transparency you so you</font>

908
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">can sort of have a look are you sure</font>

909
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:33,029
this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> space where you know</font>

910
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with DNS SEC for people</font>

911
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:36,209
published you know the aether MX records

912
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:37,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">or sign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through that and the validations</font>

913
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:38,969
occurring then you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

914
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,749
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two it's a</font>

915
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,400
space where they can work together

916
00:40:39,749 --> 00:40:43,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">because at that point you know you have</font>

917
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the correct MX records or the correct</font>

918
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:49,259
and you can be able to connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

919
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:50,640
correct sites so okay yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for the</font>

920
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:52,979
record<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that either</font>

921
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,390
public key pinning or certificate

922
00:40:52,979 --> 00:40:56,819
transparency of any chance of being

923
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:58,199
applicable here that's why talked about

924
00:40:56,819 --> 00:41:00,538
the future section should be likewise

925
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:02,819
deleted<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh I don't know if this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

926
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:06,599
time to really delve into detail how

927
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:09,119
much time people have mmm are you

928
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,859
interested in some exposition of the

929
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,849
search I mean I'm curious you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can even</font>

930
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:16,589
later and go ahead go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm</font>

931
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:18,060
transparency relies on the log servers

932
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:20,549
being able to

933
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,920
distinguish between completely made up

934
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:25,350
gibberish reports and reports that

935
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,100
actually are true observations because

936
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:31,200
the certificate chains are signed in

937
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:33,060
here the only party that's able to

938
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,370
validate the signature is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

939
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,529
that connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> server it don't have a</font>

940
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:39,299
signed piece of data we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have assigned</font>

941
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:42,170
transmission channel in the form of

942
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,730
HTTPS so if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> observe a particular</font>

943
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:47,460
policy there's no way I can convey to

944
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,560
the log that I observed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valid policy</font>

945
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,360
the log cannot be convinced by me

946
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,640
reporting it and so the log can be

947
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,620
spammed into irrelevance the attackers

948
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,000
can fill the log with so much gibberish

949
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,089
but you won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to tell the good</font>

950
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,950
from the bad and this is a fatal

951
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:03,870
obstacle to getting CT working in this

952
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:06,509
space for example I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think that CT</font>

953
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:08,069
really can work here in the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

954
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:11,430
that can work for a 50 a night without

955
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:13,080
having signed policy sir right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

957
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:20,370
signing your policies which you know hey

958
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:22,590
you can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there do ya sorry but I</font>

959
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:25,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're likely to really want</font>

963
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,650
before you can deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so the serious</font>

964
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,500
issues there if you really want to think

965
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:38,430
about it on it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlikely to fly um as</font>

966
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:40,530
for pinning in many a deployment if you

967
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,480
want to not absolutely pin down the

968
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:45,090
names of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mix hosts so you would say</font>

969
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">start on examiner.com then the attacker</font>

970
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:50,250
merely can substitute another amex host

971
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,680
for example that I I meant I meant

972
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,820
keeping but ya know keeping it keep

973
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,160
inning is our house because<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

974
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,890
has a lot of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys so if I pin</font>

975
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,200
the key for<font color="#CCCCCC"> MX 1 and mx2 example.com the</font>

00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:06,240
attacker man in the military will say at

977
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:09,359
this moment the MX hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> rmx 3 and the</font>

978
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">contents a great correct MX host and you</font>

979
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,090
know the policy matches he'll use a

980

everything checks out<font color="#E5E5E5"> by pinning pinning</font>

is supposed to prevent the ca being

00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:24,690
labeled oh so you can pin obviously

984

farther up the truck the office you<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz</font>

you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the amidst MPs have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

989
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:39,480
is that the attacker can shift if you

990
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,919
pin or cross all am tas yes you might

991
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,810
get some protection of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course many</font>

992
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,820
people and I out this tactical if this

993
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:47,100
is actually practical it'll break as

994
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:49,590
often as it works but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm leery pinning</font>

995
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,660
because budge but in many cases the

996
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:53,160
pinning across all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MTA's isn't</font>

997
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,600
viable because people get different sets

998
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,730
of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas they'll be back up in</font>

999
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,040
mex hosts and the like and so pinning

1000
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:03,980
works rather poorly we shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

1001
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:06,840
it to be a savior i would you I mean

1002
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember him saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1003
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,740
already works very poorly for HST<font color="#CCCCCC"> s and</font>

1004
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,810
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's even offers weaker</font>

1005
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,069
protection for further person TP well

1006
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,080
it's not it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> related because</font>

1007
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:18,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">indirectness issue anyway so it sort of</font>

1008
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,670
all right but anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I feel very</font>

1009
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,569
much load list is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy for example</font>

1010
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:30,690
I think I think past that point yeah

1011
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:34,370
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> my discussion in saugus yeah well</font>

1012
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:41,310
I'm here good thank you don't it's great

1013
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:47,160
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we are going to Chris who</font>

1014
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:52,650
will provide update on his draft okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

1015
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:55,259
so this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've renamed the deep</font>

1016
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:58,470
draft title not the draft name you yeah

1017
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:00,990
but the title to ask yes for mua's to

1018
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:03,560
make to help align these proposals since

1019
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:12,200
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the similar thing um</font>

1020
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:17,220
moving on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my overview slide so I</font>

1021
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:19,319
for the protocol but that's uh you know

1022
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,270
no big changes here so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

1023
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:26,600
forward so here's the key changes in the

1024
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:29,520
new draft I've changed the terminology

1025
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:32,310
and I've also changed using the term

1026
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:36,090
directives which is the term that h st s

1027
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:40,080
uses for yo for what I was calling you

1028
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:41,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">know security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keys and latches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so so</font>

1029
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,990
I've switched to directives for that

1030
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:49,290
I've changed the protocol syntax to the

1031
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">key with optional value syntax that h st</font>

1032
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:59,400
s uses uh and I've I remove the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DS DSN</font>

1033
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:04,890
header as yo if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it belongs</font>

1034
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:06,420
in the MTA relay SDS document um so we

1035
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,549
should have a discussion of if we want

1036
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:12,030
to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that feature all together</font>

1037
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:15,930
or or just take that text and stuff it

1038
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:19,130
in the in the correct document<font color="#E5E5E5"> then then</font>

1039
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:21,419
and then a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eddie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> editorial work</font>

1040
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:26,670
more you know more details on that in

1041
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:30,119
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft so next slide so yeah the big</font>

1042
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:35,160
issue that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> open on this is alignment</font>

1043
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:37,100
of the MUA and MTA SDS specs so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1044
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:43,830
I've moved forward on this by changing

1045
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:46,290
yo yo by changing the terminology um but

1046
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:48,750
you know I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to you know but I I</font>

1047
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:51,000
think it's important to align these

1048
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:54,930
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> email technology is already very</font>

1049
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,150
complicated so we want to avoid adding

1050
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:59,669
more complexity the necessary to email

1051
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:02,460
so the The Closer these are to being

1052
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:04,410
this yeah just sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate</font>

1053
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,680
technology you know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not they're</font>

1054
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:10,020
very different use cases for sts so you

1055
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,640
can't there you know they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1056
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,730
separates facts they are separate

1057
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:19,710
proposals but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there is appropriate</font>

1058
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:22,950
technology to share so next slide um so

1059
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:25,650
roughly what I would start<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1060
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:29,730
starting point for a alignment proposal

1061
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:31,890
is so I I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> started turning the</font>

1062
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:35,040
registry that was in deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

1063
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:40,319
directive registry for sts in general

1064
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:42,600
that would cover mua MTA and h st s so

1065
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,390
it would be one registry for all of them

1066
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:48,660
kind of like the email header like the

1067
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:50,730
header registry covers HTTP and email

1068
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:53,700
headers<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it would be a shared registry</font>

1069
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:55,859
along those lines where the items in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1070
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,250
registry say what protocol those items

1071
00:47:55,859 --> 00:48:02,440
apply to

1072
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh question question i'm unsure about is</font>

1073
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:08,590
yo do it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a preferred</font>

1074
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:10,750
directive syntax now right now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1075
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:14,350
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> sts draft i believe it's using</font>

1076
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:18,700
json for the directives and h<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDS is</font>

1077
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">using HDD parameter value syntax which</font>

1078
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:26,620
is yo key key option optional value with

1079
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:31,960
semi colon delimiter & and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font>

1080
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:33,700
mostly to copying the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hcp syntax but it</font>

1081
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,430
turns out if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you allow double quotes</font>

1082
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,740
around the value that<font color="#E5E5E5"> screws up you know</font>

1083
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:42,339
that then it doesn't slot into into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1084
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:44,470
MUA protocol so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i remove that from the</font>

1085
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:47,200
syntax the question is is syntax

1086
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:50,049
alignment matter or do we just want to

1087
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,299
say okay these are abstract key with

1088
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:55,600
optional value and then the syntax<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1089
00:48:52,300 --> 00:49:02,080
your protocol is protocol specific do

1090
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:04,029
people have an opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that I demerol</font>

1091
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,029
this again um so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

1092
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,320
syntax obviously I don't write parsers I

1093
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,640
use partial libraries somebody else

1094
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,090
wrote so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it doesn't matter too</font>

1095
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,529
much the the registry like my my larger

1096
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,330
question on this is do we think that

1097
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">their items in the registry which are</font>

1098
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:23,080
shared or are they entirely disjoint

1099
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:27,490
sets so the one I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> shared is</font>

1100
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:31,569
max age is shared by<font color="#CCCCCC"> M MTA st</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> S&H SDS</font>

1101
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:35,859
that max age is shared on that may be

1102
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:39,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only one in the initial set um but</font>

1103
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:41,590
you know is that it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a problem I</font>

1104
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:42,550
mean I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I hate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is because</font>

1105
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,410
it makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound like I don't want to</font>

1106
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:45,760
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> have code reuse or spec we use</font>

1107
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:49,140
but then my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if that's the</font>

1108
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,280
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that's shared you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

1109
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:55,839
advantages are going to showed registry

1110
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:58,120
um well the separate registries then

1111
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,190
each document has to define its own

1112
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,200
registry and describe the registration

1113
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:05,050
process and have its own expert reviewer

1114
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,899
and as you know go through the whole ITF

1115
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:09,770
review process or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ana review process</font>

1116
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,660
to create the registry

1117
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:14,660
and so there's there's a certain amount

1118
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:17,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">of overhead to creating a iono registry</font>

1119
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:20,509
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to share that overhead</font>

1120
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:23,770
that that that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm leaning towards</font>

1121
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:27,500
a common registry but you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1122
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:30,440
firmly in that direction so hey Dave

1123
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:33,110
Crocker um there it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me there</font>

1124
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:37,280
should be an overriding sense that these

1125
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:38,690
are reasonable to keep together and the

1126
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,390
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> point behind a registry is</font>

1127
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:44,300
extensibility there could be more header

1128

headers or headers or header<font color="#E5E5E5"> fee right</font>

1129
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:49,970
right so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think i have it on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1130
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:53,240
slide but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i provide proposed an expert</font>

1131
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:55,399
review model for the registry so so as

1132
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,959
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as there is an overriding sense</font>

1133
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,050
that it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for these to be</font>

1134
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,510
together that that in over the long haul

1135
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:05,480
there's a fair amount of overlap and

1136
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:08,150
very likely sharing of entries even if

1137
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:10,550
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one right now then it would</font>

1138
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sense to have only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one having them</font>

1139
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,120
be separate creates the problem that

1140
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,830
should there be sharing you've just

1141
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">created a whole lot more work and the</font>

1142
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:21,700
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for becoming the divergent</font>

1143
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:26,480
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the reality is somewhere</font>

1144
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:29,200
in the middle of those two positions I

1145
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:32,270
don't think there's a strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> case that</font>

1146
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,370
there's a hugely strong case for sharing

1147
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:39,080
them but I think they're there is there

1148
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:41,750
is a an example of overlap so so I lean

1149
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:44,210
towards sharing them right now for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean</font>

1150
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:46,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Leonard as a parser writer reuse is good</font>

1151
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:48,920
and for security reusing constructs that

1152
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,779
have already been<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzed would help</font>

1153
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:58,130
lead to fewer implementation error so

1154
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:59,780
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sharing sorry Dan Margolis</font>

1155
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,490
again what what are some examples of

1156
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,170
extensions that we would want to add in

1157
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:06,290
the future so I think for deep it's it's

1158
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:07,910
more obvious to me because you're you

1159
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,410
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're trying to provide security</font>

1160
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:12,879
constructs which might rely on other

1161
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:15,649
other primitives in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sts</font>

1162
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,600
we might but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> STS almost is the</font>

1163
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:21,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">primitive and so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sensibility case is</font>

1164
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:23,770
less clear to me um well I mean HTS had

1165
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,570
the same situation where they

1166
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:27,550
you know when they published it they

1167
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:31,510
didn't think there was any extensibility

1168
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:34,030
and there's already a what there's

1169
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:40,540
already a limited use extension to HST s

1170
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:44,140
out in the wild that I so you know my my

1171
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,820
thinking is yo is we've are we've we've

1172
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,400
already seen an example where an

1173
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:50,320
extensions needed let's just yo I've

1174
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,360
already written most the registry work

1175
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,330
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to do is split this out into</font>

1176
00:52:52,360 --> 00:53:00,220
a separate draft we we reference it

1177
00:52:55,330 --> 00:53:02,259
we're done<font color="#E5E5E5"> um Mexican company I don't I</font>

1178
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,850
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I directly can comment on whether</font>

1179
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,430
the register should be joined or not I

1180
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to say that the SDS artistry</font>

1181
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:11,200
is really the report registry not the

1182
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:14,680
STS registry the bulk of the terms there

1183
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,509
apply equally to any mt 8 MP a right for

1184
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:20,770
those need to be separate registries

1185
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:23,080
that the as you know the SGS directive

1186
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:25,990
registry is separate from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recording</font>

1187
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">registry right those do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know those</font>

1188
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:35,529
are clearly separate functions um let's

1189
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:39,370
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so oh I had one more bullet on</font>

1190
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:41,620
the previous slide on the the other area

1191
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:43,750
where we need to talk about alignment is

1192
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:46,600
reporting mechanisms so right now the

1193
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:50,850
MUA<font color="#E5E5E5"> STS has an in-band reporting</font>

1194
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:53,080
mechanism and smtp SES has that

1195
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:57,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">out-of-band reporting mechanism that was</font>

1196
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:59,860
just split out into a shared spec so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i i</font>

1197
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:02,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think it's interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to share the</font>

1198
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:06,040
out-of-band reporting mechanism between

1199
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:07,799
both proposals so if there's no

1200
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:11,220
objections to moving in that direction

1201
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:14,470
then I'm on the hook to review the

1202
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:16,299
out-of-band reporting mechanism and and

1203
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:18,790
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1204
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:21,640
features that I think mua's need for

1205
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:23,140
reporting and conversely i was

1206
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,049
advocating stronger for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1207
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:27,940
direction strongly to share the in-band

1208
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:31,630
reporting mechanism as much as possible

1209
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:34,690
i'd like to see 14 sts<font color="#E5E5E5"> indane so if</font>

1210
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:37,060
you're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write up or with me to</font>

1211
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,540
write up they come on in band mechanism

1212
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:42,370
that be

1213
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:47,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">for on so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in-band mechanism</font>

1214
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:49,240
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the MU ases draft right now uh-huh</font>

1215
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:51,490
god<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really don't want to edit edit a</font>

1216
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,350
third draft but is that the right thing

1217
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:56,529
to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> split that out into a third</font>

1218
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:58,180
draft that we both reference and it

1219
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:00,250
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it would</font>

1220
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:02,109
actually be a non-normative reference

1221
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:05,200
which would be the nice thing about it

1222
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:07,900
right so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow us again on</font>

1223
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the on the invent i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see</font>

1224
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,320
a downside to<font color="#CCCCCC"> having you know a</font>

1225
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:13,390
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> error code for like I mean for</font>

1226
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,130
server to server smtp if you say i

1227
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:17,020
terminated the connection because of a

1228
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:18,880
TLS a failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's quite</font>

1229
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:21,910
reasonable to have a different quick

1230
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,300
code for that I think presumably that's

1231
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:26,799
a different draft both in band and other

1232
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,840
bands<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to me to be useful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1233
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:36,010
conceivably<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would implement both so</font>

1234
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:38,830
you know okay it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a call for</font>

1235
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:41,410
don't work here yeah it looks like

1236
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:48,630
there's there's leaning towards bolts so

1237
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:52,690
okay more work for me there we go uh yes

1238
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:57,190
oh that's a good would anyone be willing

1239
00:55:52,690 --> 00:56:01,540
to co edit the the in-band reporting

1240
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:05,380
mechanism that would be that would be

1241
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:12,190
wonderful thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may the minutes note</font>

1242
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:16,450
that Victor volunteered<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the shared</font>

1243
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:18,970
sts registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was noting most the</font>

1244
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:22,210
directives are protocol specific because

1245
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:24,100
these three use cases are quite

1246
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:25,780
different you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

1247
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,569
semantics are just so different between

1248
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:32,740
the use case even though it it really is

1249
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:40,060
the same function we're performing same

1250
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:42,009
core function um I'm not sure I have a

1251
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:45,240
clear view on whether we should share

1252
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,240
syntax or not yet

1253
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:54,230
I just you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel if people are</font>

1254
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:58,220
already deploying code with the JSON

1255
00:56:54,230 --> 00:57:04,940
syntax maybe we shouldn't change um but

1256
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:08,569
ah so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this topic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's</font>

1257
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:10,940
kind of two questions here and the

1258
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:13,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">obvious question that will always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

1259
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:16,070
how many people read the draft but also

1260
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,799
how many people actually implemented

1261
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:20,270
something from from your draft I think

1262
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,400
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question that you need to ask</font>

1263
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:27,200
well I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just changed the syntax in</font>

1264
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:30,170
compatibly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay uh uh uh in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get in my</font>

1265
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,990
draft so there you go I mean it also has

1266
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:37,250
the warning<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't implement yet talk cuz</font>

1267
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:39,109
I yo I believe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know reaching the</font>

1268
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:47,780
point where I think it's done before I

1269
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:49,520
remove that warning um the UH so you

1270
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,920
decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for more guidance</font>

1271
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:59,450
on whether or not just share syntax and

1272
00:57:51,920 --> 00:58:01,580
I'm not hearing anything uh do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

1273
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:03,230
a sense of sort of how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1274
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,460
lined up I know this is putting you on

1275
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,950
the spot but how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are lined</font>

1276
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:09,230
up to implement this or what the what

1277
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:13,819
the sort of see in production timeline

1278
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:17,750
would be on mua sts<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't have a</font>

1279
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:19,460
clear sense of odd oh that I mean that's

1280
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:22,520
fair question no I don't have a clear

1281
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:24,410
sense right now for the timeline I mean

1282
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,640
it's been a no I didn't work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec</font>

1283
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:30,589
for longer but you know there you go um

1284
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:33,170
ok the I really think you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

1285
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:35,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">his question on the list because in the</font>

1286
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:38,420
past way they heard some voices people

1287
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:41,960
saying they implementing something of it

1288
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:44,270
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will ask it on I mean please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

1289
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:47,660
it again on the list anyway and you will

1290
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:49,400
get a better sense okay so why don't I

1291
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,620
go ahead with the assumption that we're

1292
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:56,600
not sharing syntax since we're not right

1293
00:58:51,620 --> 00:59:00,680
now and and that's less change yeah and

1294
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:03,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">then if somebody has a strong feeling</font>

1295
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:06,200
that syntax should be shared we can we

1296
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,390
can address that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes up on</font>

1297
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:11,359
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing about the shared</font>

1298
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:14,598
registry is I'm proposing it the expert

1299
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:16,730
review and that there be a limited use

1300
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:19,550
flag you either it's either common user

1301
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:22,069
limited use for a registry entry so

1302
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:24,140
basically the expert review bar for a

1303
00:59:22,069 --> 00:59:25,880
limited use entry would be much lower

1304
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:28,609
because you know there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1305
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:32,599
tension<font color="#E5E5E5"> and registry between collision</font>

1306
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:35,779
avoidance and where where you want to

1307
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:37,670
make it easy to register and and clear

1308
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,530
semantics where you want to make it hard

1309
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:42,230
to register it as a semantics of what it

1310
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:44,329
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> are clear and so I like the</font>

1311
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:46,400
limited use flag as the compromise

1312
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:49,970
between those two and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we already have</font>

1313
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:52,730
one example of limited use that I will

1314
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:56,959
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> registered in the HST s space after</font>

1315
00:59:52,730 --> 01:00:00,079
this is published so on so that's why

1316
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,740
that Flags there so that's that's it for

1317
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:07,760
the shared registry I think the areas

1318
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:11,509
where we're drafts are not aligning mtas

1319
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:15,980
yes sorry it's just https now drop them

1320
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:19,520
pretend the DNS SEC wasn't there well

1321
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:22,099
muass uses in band TLS although that's

1322
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:27,020
they're just different on how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works</font>

1323
01:00:22,099 --> 01:00:30,260
the MTA relay and h st s use match<font color="#E5E5E5"> max</font>

1324
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:34,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">age in the MUA sts we decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not to use</font>

1325
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that on and then other directives are</font>

1326
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:41,599
protocol specific so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where the</font>

1327
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:44,558
protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lie I think that's that</font>

1328
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:53,809
my last<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide I think it is yeah yeah</font>

1329
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:55,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay any other comments on mua SCS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1330
01:00:53,809 --> 01:01:00,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll try to turn around a couple</font>

1331
01:00:55,819 --> 01:01:03,250
revisions as quickly as i can to to get

1332
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this done</font>

1333
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:17,770
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now we are ready for</font>

1334
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:39,100
remote presenter good luck to us Jim you

1335
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:45,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">should step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vtec ok so again</font>

1336
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:51,600
if your Jim if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> listening to the</font>

1337
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:55,420
remote stream you should yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1338
01:01:51,600 --> 01:02:03,779
step<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the meat echo a microphone</font>

1339
01:01:55,420 --> 01:02:08,980
now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will is learning the system oh</font>

1340
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:12,119
yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright file there's an</font>

1341
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:14,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">interlude is Lexi here earlier so am</font>

1342
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:17,800
Alexei Melnikov is one of the art IDs

1343
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:20,140
and Alexei knows like crap loads more

1344
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,790
about email than I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1345
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:24,279
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense to swap kind of the</font>

1346
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:27,430
responsible ad for the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group at</font>

1347
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:28,840
some point in the near future I guess so

1348
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,980
we chat about it with the chairs it

1349
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,780
doesn't make any real difference but

1350
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,900
just so you know and are not shocked or

1351
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:37,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">surprised wedding but Alexei will be the</font>

1352
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:46,510
responsible helper as opposed to me from

1353
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:48,460
sometime near in the future oh yeah so

1354
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:52,180
let's see if I'm pretty let's see what

1355
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:55,690
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i press this that means that</font>

1356
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:59,200
you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jim hi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can you hear me</font>

1357
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:01,119
all right oh yeah oh hey good it works i

1358
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:04,990
finally found the right button on an me

dekho so are my are my slides up in the

1360
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,979
room there yeah your intro slide is up

1361
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,770
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me when to flip and i'll try</font>

1362
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:13,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">to give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback on what's showing</font>

1363
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:15,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay bear with me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a sec OH is busy</font>

1364
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:15,880
with me dekho and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1365
01:03:15,369 --> 01:03:18,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to</font>

1366
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:22,450
to get my slide so I can see them here

1367
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:26,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well so it'll take a second there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1368
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:29,078
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so I don't have a whole lot</font>

1369
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:32,380
to report on require TLS this time

1370
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:38,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">around I presented it I think fairly</font>

1371
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:38,730
extensively down in Buenos Aires and I

1372
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:44,440
hope people<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I have</font>

1373
01:03:42,099 --> 01:03:46,180
some backup slides if if people would

1374
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:50,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">like me to represent some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of some of</font>

1375
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:50,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's a different approach to</font>

1376
01:03:50,609 --> 01:03:59,410
applying stronger requirements on TLS

1377
01:03:55,710 --> 01:04:01,630
transport for smtp where this comes from

1378
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:04,149
the sending side rather than a policy

1379
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:09,069
that's published by the by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1380
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:10,809
recipients<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID so rather than having some</font>

1381
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:13,450
sort of a policy record that's published

1382
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:16,000
this is basically a tag that goes along

1383
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:22,930
it's on a very fine-grained basis it's

1384
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:27,150
it's a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> by message and the the</font>

1385
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:30,549
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tag follows along and</font>

1386
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:34,630
essentially make sure that both require

1387
01:04:30,549 --> 01:04:37,480
TLS and TLS with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proper</font>

1388
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:40,420
characteristics are used whenever the

1389
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:42,789
messages is forwarded<font color="#CCCCCC"> onward so please</font>

1390
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:46,960
go on to I think it's slide to review

1391
01:04:42,789 --> 01:04:48,789
problem statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in ok so the</font>

1392
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,549
the problem that I'm that I'm trying to

1393
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:54,430
solve here is that TLS is opportunistic

1394
01:04:51,549 --> 01:04:57,880
now that's often what you would really

1395
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:59,730
like to have happen you want email to be

1396
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:03,220
delivered that's kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> postal</font>

1397
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:07,599
paradigm on deliver the mail whenever

1398
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:09,819
you can um but what that means in

1399
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,789
practice here is that if you can't

1400
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:15,099
negotiate start TLS you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically send</font>

1401
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:20,559
the message without start TLS if you

1402
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:22,930
can't verify the the server certificate

1403
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:25,900
you basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> note the fact that it</font>

1404
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:28,269
failed in you and you send that and send

1405
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,530
the message anyway but this is often

1406
01:05:28,269 --> 01:05:31,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you want but it's not</font>

1407
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:32,860
always what you want there are times

1408
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:35,950
when you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send a sensitive</font>

1409
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:37,150
message there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> times in particular</font>

1410
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:40,180
where you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like additional</font>

1411
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:41,980
protection for even the the header

information the envelope information

that are not protected by end-to-end

1414
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:55,529
encryption and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example think about a</font>

1415
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:58,480
foreign correspondent that's sending a

1416
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:59,890
something from a war zone or something

1417
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,100
like that there might be situations

1418
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:06,430
where they they want to make sure that

1419
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:11,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that message either is sent securely or</font>

1420
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:15,220
isn't sent at all so go on to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

1421
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:16,900
slide and so I i missed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i missed the</font>

01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">cutoff for the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> graft i do have</font>

1423
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:23,200
a heavy revision kind of in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the works</font>

1424
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:24,910
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i kind of felt that since i missed</font>

1425
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,919
the cutoff it's inappropriate for me to

1426
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:30,339
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and present a new revision here but</font>

1427
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:32,710
be looking for one I just kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of wanted</font>

1428
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:35,800
to let everybody know that I'm still

1429
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:38,140
still working on this I do I have been

1430
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:41,320
advised that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one commercial MTA</font>

1431
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:43,720
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning to do an implementation</font>

01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:46,840
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so we'll have something to test</font>

1433
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,950
it with you know since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one MTA</font>

1434
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,080
probably not in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1435
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:54,669
interoperability but at least in terms

1436
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:56,710
of effectiveness and if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are any</font>

1437
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:59,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions or if there's a sense whether</font>

1438
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:01,750
i should<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and give a quick review</font>

1439
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:08,020
of what require TLS is I'd be happy to

1440
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:10,300
do that question I remember on the list

1441
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:12,130
there was some discussion this<font color="#CCCCCC"> victim</font>

1442
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,290
colony<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember in the list though</font>

1443
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,910
some discussion as to whether the thing

1444
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:18,100
should be very specific as to the

1445
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:20,470
properties of require TLS and mandate

1446
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:23,860
ciphers and all kinds of things or in

1447
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:26,470
order to be usable be much looser and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1448
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:28,420
allow these things to be under specified

1449
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:30,939
and I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we reach consensus</font>

1450
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:33,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one the other thing I wanted to</font>

1451
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:36,340
mention is that they're probably should

1452
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:39,759
be a converse specification in which you

1453
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:42,160
say no my mail in fact has nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1454
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,360
any sensitivity at all but damn well

1455
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,629
deliver it even if there's

1456
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:49,240
TS ordained because it's time sensitive

1457
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:51,490
so in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to require TLS spec we</font>

1458
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:55,180
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say TLS back if I</font>

1459
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:58,060
would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> so or whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ah and just</font>

1460
01:07:55,180 --> 01:08:02,649
send send send the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pto's you know</font>

1461
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:04,630
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah ok yeah that's interesting</font>

1462
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:07,990
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree we haven't reached consensus</font>

1463
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:11,560
about how specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> required TLS should</font>

1464
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:14,140
be I'm essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> not planning on</font>

1465
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:17,109
making any on making any changes right

1466
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:20,859
now pending you know some more some more

1467
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:23,710
discussion on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that topic the you know a</font>

1468
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:26,109
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the changes that that I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1469
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:29,350
describe were things about you know kind

1470
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:32,200
of the motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and deployment and</font>

1471
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:39,040
probably less on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the details of</font>

1472
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:41,319
the protocol the that's an amusing

1473
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:43,750
suggestion to write a TLS

1474
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:52,569
specification I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the</font>

1475
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:56,830
person to write that one all right was

1476
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:58,689
that it that was all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had unless people</font>

1477
01:08:56,830 --> 01:09:04,540
would like a review of what require TLS

1478
01:08:58,689 --> 01:09:06,879
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually asked who</font>

1479
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:09,220
who here in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room has read the</font>

1480
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,310
required to last at least the last draft

1481
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:16,360
Oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of people fair number of</font>

1482
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:18,370
people so it doesn't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if</font>

1483
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:24,339
anybody feels they want an introduction

1484
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the topic um there there's there's</font>

1485
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:30,160
one hand for introduction I don't know

1486
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:34,120
if that count now I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font>

1487
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:39,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that offline Ola um oh yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay contact</font>

1488
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:42,970
me if anybody wants a one<font color="#CCCCCC"> other intro so</font>

1489
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:46,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've got questions at the mic only you</font>

1490
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:49,210
want zone coming from the world of sick

1491
01:09:46,689 --> 01:09:51,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very interested in this because we</font>

1492
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:55,830
failed miserably and sip with something

1493
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:58,920
called cps<font color="#CCCCCC"> URI where are you a</font>

1494
01:09:55,830 --> 01:10:01,769
requires a tela session almost all the

1495
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,960
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a because there's</font>

1496
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:06,810
no proof what happens between the

1497
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:09,840
different proxy service and we're trying

1498
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:12,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fix that in various ways but still</font>

1499
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,850
haven't fixed it so maybe this is a

1500
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:16,260
similar problem have a feeling that

1501
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:18,420
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to solve the same problem</font>

1502
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:21,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">as we do and how to set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a secure</font>

1503
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:25,140
session the first hope and maybe do

1504
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:27,690
something with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> following hopes so</font>

1505
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:30,060
I'm particularly interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this work</font>

1506
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:33,990
and see if I can steal some inspiration

1507
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:36,780
back to the zip core group<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks okay</font>

1508
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:39,330
well thanks all I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not familiar with</font>

1509
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:42,809
that sip s specification all I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1510
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:44,790
look at it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will note that we</font>

1511
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:47,060
are expecting a certain amount of good

1512
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:48,690
behavior on the part of inter MIDI

1513
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:50,430
intermediaries but on the other hand

1514
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:53,820
we're expecting that anyway if they're

1515
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:56,160
handling our email yeah thatthat's this

1516
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:58,080
is Barry that's really the key that if

1517
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,519
you say you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you're supposed</font>

1518
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:04,980
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and there's no verification</font>

1519
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:08,190
that it actually happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I gather</font>

1520
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:11,250
that sip wanted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> verification ya</font>

1521
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ullah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Beck this is an old specification</font>

1522
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:15,810
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far I haven't seen any</font>

1523
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:18,170
implementation that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1524
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:20,990
follows to specification properly

1525
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:23,760
failing that we have no other way to

1526
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:25,200
require a TLS session in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hope</font>

1527
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:39,030
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something I really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1528
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:41,970
solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so I guess we went through</font>

1529
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:45,929
all all our agenda and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really ask</font>

1530
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:50,040
people to and to continue work on on the

1531
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:52,280
list and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even looks to me</font>

1532
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,810
that based on on these discussions and

1533
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:58,009
we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> decide later whether we meet</font>

1534
01:11:54,810 --> 01:12:01,590
face-to-face at the next meeting or not

1535
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:05,940
really let's let's provide feedback on

1536
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:07,740
the list and move forward this way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1537
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess where we're into I'm going to meet</font>

1538
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:12,910
you off

1539
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:17,349
Jim thanks is there anybody we're in the

1540
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:20,019
open mic so open for other business you

1541
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:24,760
might get an hour back approximately oh

1542
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:26,680
not quite an hour but not seeing anybody

1543
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,840
rushing to the mic I guess we close the

1544
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:35,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">meeting early and maybe see you in Seoul</font>

1545
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:36,880
or maybe not thank you anybody who

1546
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:44,610
didn't sign the blue sheet come up and

1547
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:50,130
do so and there's there's one blue sheep

1548
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:53,339
thingy missing somewhere in the room ah

1549
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:53,340
