<font color="#CCCCCC">only have a 60 minute slot so we're</font>

move expeditiously we have update

71
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,520
basically the agenda sort of boils down

72
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,219
to we have updates on a few of the

73
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,229
drafts that are in progress we're going

74
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of related</font>

75
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:52,870
research and implementation projects and

76
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:58,449
then you know go get beer or whatever

77
00:05:52,870 --> 00:06:00,550
happens next so the main the main piece

78
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,830
of our first milestone which we've been

79
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,590
referring to as doc one draft ITF caps

80
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:09,400
transports we finished working group

81
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,390
last call it's we gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Spencer</font>

82
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,900
Spencer had some

83
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,979
comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian read the draft and so I</font>

84
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,599
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe there's any outstanding</font>

85
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,910
comments and so I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next step</font>

86
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:25,600
is that it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to ihe review</font>

87
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:27,940
and so that's the that's the first half

88
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,460
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document then we we agreed that</font>

89
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:35,650
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were going to add in oh look a little</font>

90
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:37,409
message about my verizon courage we we

91
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:42,219
agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

92
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:43,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">taps transports usage as a second part</font>

93
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,370
of the first milestone so it's not

94
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">really a charter it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a charter</font>

95
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">change it's just that the milestone now</font>

96
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,360
has got multiple documents in it and so

97
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,619
we're gonna hear an update on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

98
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,520
so one of the questions to talk about is

99
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:01,240
whether that's done Jeff kissing taps

100
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,460
min set is<font color="#CCCCCC"> tacitly talk about a couple</font>

101
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">of times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I so I think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

102
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:11,109
first cut is two for the our second

103
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,150
milestone on identifying a minimum set

104
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,710
of services that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tassel support and so</font>

105
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,700
another question we have is whether

106
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,400
that's done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're gonna be</font>

107
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,550
hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from those authors today and</font>

108
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,299
then like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said there's a number of</font>

109
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,510
implementation and research efforts

110
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,310
going on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are related to taps and</font>

111
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,630
and so I think that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

112
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,670
promising that there's some work going

113
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,710
on and maybe we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting to the less</font>

114
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:37,780
arguing and more doing phase of the

115
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:41,260
working group here's a update on the

116
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,179
schedule so we these this these dates

117
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,370
reflect changes that we agreed on at our

118
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,210
last meeting so we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

119
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:53,230
finish the first milestone by the next

120
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:56,849
ITF meeting hopefully need that means

121
00:07:53,230 --> 00:08:01,420
fishing up the the the usage documents

122
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:03,910
and then by the subsequent IDF finish up

123
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,010
the the men set documents and I don't

124
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,050
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can really know enough about</font>

125
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,000
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen after that to</font>

126
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,780
know whether that<font color="#E5E5E5"> November 2017 date is</font>

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,780
realistic or not

128
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,789
this when I handed over to my co-chair

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:25,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a few comments on school yes</font>

132
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,900
noticeable feature of it and there are

133
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,370
some some topics that's popped up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

134
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,579
also have been watching what's happening

135
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:41,469
in the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and and this is this</font>

136
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,940
is this is about a I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

137
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:46,760
personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I have been missing</font>

138
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,160
that we have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> been discussed in and</font>

139
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,069
taps and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> both agree like we should</font>

140
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,560
actually give you some things about that

141
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">so basically it tough says you have</font>

142
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">struct everything from application not</font>

143
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,380
everything as long as much as possible

144
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,940
but actually and the applications they

145
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,010
are kind of getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart earnest one</font>

146
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,500
and because this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because also</font>

147
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,240
like they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to choose like what</font>

148
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,650
transport they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they act like do</font>

149
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,260
some switching between the transport

150
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,819
they use so they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like to</font>

151
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,520
know what's going underneath I mean if

152
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,100
you if I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet maybe</font>

153
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,959
I'll change my we're very fit using<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

154
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,610
anticipate as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ed plate is</font>

155
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:28,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">a transport this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is happening and this</font>

156
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,380
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like self-tuning you don't if</font>

157
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you kind of behave you can</font>

158
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,890
do package your information in different

159
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:38,270
way the transfer is different underneath

160
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:40,130
and and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is like the</font>

161
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,720
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are responsible for the</font>

162
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,490
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience so if the application</font>

163
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,230
doesn't work is actually nobody's gonna

164
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,690
blame that transport listen like this

165
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,520
application doesn't work so basically

166
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:53,150
what what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important is like</font>

167
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,920
when it doesn't work and how do you know

168
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,870
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this like transport</font>

169
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,089
happening and also there is a like

170
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,040
robust predictable behavior we need from

171
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:04,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">the applications and that means like in</font>

172
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,430
some of sub network you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font>

173
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:09,469
these selection of transport pretty fast

174
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,020
and some in some networks it might take

175
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">time but this application is to know why</font>

176
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:18,140
is happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a session set of</font>

177
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,089
time so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Latin that it also matters</font>

178
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,750
like tang time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the first bite</font>

179
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:26,899
this also matters so so that's also

180
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,610
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then that can</font>

181
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:31,699
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be application would be</font>

182
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,740
like to have from the from going<font color="#E5E5E5"> not not</font>

183
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:36,529
bound and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> informational</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

184
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,540
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs I mean usually they saw</font>

185
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:40,399
but if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server environment</font>

186
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,490
the server knows lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the cost</font>

187
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,959
operation costs and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

188
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:47,569
it night it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

189
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,550
optimize and it might also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

190
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:52,579
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their back to</font>

191
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,469
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> true the application like whether</font>

192
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:57,290
whether they only use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some connection or</font>

193
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:01,459
not not or move between some connections

194
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:03,819
like a cellular<font color="#E5E5E5"> by I mean paid by buses</font>

195
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:06,109
on plate part and stuff like that and

196
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:08,689
another observation we have made like

197
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,089
okay there there is a mobility every

198
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:12,349
concern and we used to think like

199
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,480
mobility means like you were going

200
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're moving and you're changing your</font>

201
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,379
your IP address so you have like

202
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,969
multiple you have a new path that you

203
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:24,019
actually would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to continue your</font>

204
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,879
session read but it also the the current

205
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:28,490
kind of trend is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when you</font>

206
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,499
change your<font color="#E5E5E5"> path you might also need to</font>

207
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,329
change the connect connection that

208
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:34,610
Testament<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you the service provider</font>

209
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:37,160
like all the servers so that's like

210
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the new nose and whether you want</font>

211
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,389
to application would like to actually

212
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:43,339
pass know this information and we have

213
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,439
something and differently<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these are</font>

214
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:48,199
the observation we've made and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

215
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:50,779
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> group as a</font>

216
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:52,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">future-proof</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and also not only feature</font>

217
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:55,699
provides like in current way if somebody

218
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,679
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use tabs and make it and have</font>

219
00:11:55,699 --> 00:12:00,139
these tabs really happy useful to them

220
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,360
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> the taps working with me to think</font>

221
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:06,439
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of not bong information</font>

222
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:10,549
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like you what do you hide</font>

223
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:12,379
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> expo what is Heidi or I mean the test</font>

224
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:15,980
should actually makes the application

225
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:17,749
developers life simple bye-bye but also

226
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,730
it should give some information back to

227
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:22,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the applications</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can do some</font>

228
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,389
kind of self changing cell behaving this

229
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,179
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so the northbound</font>

230
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:28,309
function is important also so when you

231
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">are doing work on the tops I think this</font>

232
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:33,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where one more thing that</font>

233
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:37,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">when he should think about but that's it</font>

234
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:39,550
I don't think we're going to discuss

235
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,860
it in details because we don't have time

236
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:48,280
but it's for I have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

237
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:49,570
about so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the last missing</font>

238
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,189
bolt from the slide is that there's

239
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,140
already a thread going on on the list

240
00:12:51,190 --> 00:13:07,290
and that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is related to that then we</font>

241
00:12:53,140 --> 00:13:10,720
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to discuss it yes 9 I</font>

242
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,670
have a clicker<font color="#CCCCCC"> free of two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

243
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">stand in the box and bury the voice with</font>

244
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:21,069
this don't find anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so oh I have</font>

245
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be closed answer so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an update</font>

246
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:30,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the draft ITF</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tabs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transferred usage</font>

247
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:33,580
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we updated from zero</font>

248
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:35,110
zero two zero one and one of the first

249
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,630
things that we updated was there we

250
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,450
provided some clarification on the how

251
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,550
the nomenclature in the document was

252
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,920
defined<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually that means so</font>

253
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,229
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of set such somehow</font>

254
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,270
in a static way that you the categories

255
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,940
can either be connection or they or data

256
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,050
and the subcategories for the connection

257
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,450
you would have established and

258
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,910
availability maintenance and termination

259
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,500
so that's basically kind of

260
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,699
clarification because some people got it

261
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,100
wrong in a way that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

262
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,350
read the RFC's and could come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with it</font>

263
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,960
kind of kind of some sort of random

264
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:11,589
categories but here is like sets those

265
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,420
categories in a clear format then the

266
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:16,240
next thing that is added to the document

267
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:19,349
is basically we incorporated the MP<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

268
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,910
in the into the three<font color="#CCCCCC"> past process and</font>

269
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:25,210
we had a contribution from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christophe</font>

270
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:29,819
from apple and we incorporated three

271
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:32,890
rfcs of MP<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp in in the document and</font>

272
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,650
using that basically MP<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp provides</font>

273
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:39,460
some additional services that that we

274
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:41,199
have using TCP and sctp provides on top

275
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,570
of that some additional services<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

276
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,790
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> three which is basically adding a</font>

277
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">sap flow removing it or disabling in</font>

278
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,649
participe because it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in</font>

279
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,369
the colonel

280
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:54,079
so and we also provided a change to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

281
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:56,389
rules in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

282
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,359
allowed basically that allows basically

283
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:02,180
to use experimental rfcs in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trac RFC's so that we could</font>

285
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:10,309
have the possibility of including the

286
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:11,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">MPT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CPR FCS and then with regards to the</font>

287
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:16,368
discussion that we had in the previous

288
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:19,069
ITF about the incorporation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS into</font>

00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:21,319
the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had some conversation</font>

with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tls chairs we also got in touch</font>

with their with the you THS and the

00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:28,910
feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we got from the TLS chest</font>

293
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,429
was basically we've got lots of

294
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:34,129
documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> incorporate the TLS</font>

295
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:35,749
without actually describing an API also

296
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:37,939
we've got lots of features<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

297
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:40,999
deployed in different applications that

298
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:43,639
are also not described in a TLS bag so

299
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:47,199
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to that the TLS has got lots</font>

00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of options that relies on X dot 509 and</font>

301
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,349
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually more complexity we</font>

302
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,319
would try to come up with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

303
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,929
definition of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an API and we would either</font>

304
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:59,779
end up having a too<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplistic API or</font>

305
00:15:56,929 --> 00:16:01,069
too complex and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't really</font>

306
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,470
possible to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

307
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:06,199
trade-off between having an appropriate

308
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,269
API that is you know rich enough and not

309
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,508
so complex to actually do the work so

310
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:14,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the conclusion based on the conversation</font>

311
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:16,910
with did with the TLS chairs as well as

312
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,800
the talks with the tab choose and 80s

313
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,990
and the you THS and on the mailing list

314
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,849
was that actually we don't think that we

315
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,410
have the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> and currently we don't</font>

316
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that we have the expertise of</font>

317
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,009
capacities within tabs to actually write

318
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:31,699
that section so we're going to leave it

319
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:34,429
at that and the future plan further for

320
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:39,258
the draft is basically to incorporate

321
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:44,540
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CTP related documents rfcs that</font>

322
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:48,009
are beyond RFC 4960 basically to cover a

323
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:51,410
different CTP document some of them

324
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:53,629
basically have their own API related

325
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:57,139
subsections in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to that we would</font>

326
00:16:53,629 --> 00:17:00,079
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to incorporate some experimental</font>

327
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:01,920
RFC's that are related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp like TFO</font>

328
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,210
and others<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font>

329
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,829
also we have got a contributor

330
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:08,170
marie-josee that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d</font>

331
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:10,720
incorporating the DCC p and this is

332
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,910
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen in the future and I</font>

333
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe that's my update so it's very</font>

334
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:38,320
quick one ok any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you</font>

335
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:40,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">name your sake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so next I like the</font>

next item<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh don't forgot make sure the</font>

337
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,820
weapon and changes since draft 01 is we

338
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,850
talked to lots of people in the ITF and

339
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,250
it was fun they told us lots about UDP

340
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,290
there's not a lot of documentation but

341
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:59,020
UDP we gathered what we could it's all

342
00:17:53,290 --> 00:18:00,760
in there and that's like and we we did a

343
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,980
bit of work we actually try to implement

344
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,500
what we rope so there is some running

345
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">cord in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the neat project github which</font>

346
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,990
now supports UDP which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

347
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:16,690
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a triumph for UDP and UDP is not that</font>

348
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:18,550
difficult aha or so they say yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

349
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">fix em yeah we're not going to carry</font>

350
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,350
that well and I think we're done<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

351
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,200
did what we set out to do we wrote down

352
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:31,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything we discovered about UDP it's</font>

353
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,280
in the draft and we could get more

354
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:35,260
feedback but I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will get a</font>

355
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,270
lot more useful feedback I guess we've

356
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,090
gathered all the low-hanging fruit we

357
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:43,240
can find and the only question I've got

358
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:47,980
is is no 20 pages long it's got about 30

359
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:50,440
references in is it a stupid question to

360
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,720
ask do you want to publish the document

361
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,910
in two volumes with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

362
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,830
working group document and get some UDP

363
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,470
reviewers on the UDP stuff and TCP

364
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:02,020
reviewers sctp and other reviewers on

365
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,690
the second document and putting two

366
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,360
together I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be interesting to</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to take these documents</font>

378
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:41,039
through IHG review we have an opinion on

379
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:42,988
this or not would you like one big

380
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,690
document or too small the document says

381
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:49,919
to medium-sized tackle yes all right

382
00:19:45,690 --> 00:20:02,070
well okay no one medium-sized and quite

383
00:19:49,919 --> 00:20:04,830
small bucket compared to NFS Spencer

384

<font color="#E5E5E5">Dawkins responsible area director I</font>

385
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:10,080
would always say do the right thing I'm

386
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:12,960
I'm fine taking taking documents through

387
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">in smaller pieces I would be I would be</font>

388
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine doing that I would encourage you</font>

389
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,830
not to use and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> sp4 is the standards</font>

390
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:23,609
but we wish you decide how big a

391
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:27,869
document can be and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say that with love</font>

00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:28,799
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys I think you</font>

393
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:30,149
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that there's</font>

394
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,559
appropriate cross references so you

don't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't end up reading</font>

397
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:39,119
that's the risk I'm happy to it with it

398
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,859
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> good he whips them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to coordinate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

399
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,478
the other editors anyway so I'm happy to

400
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:44,759
take it either way I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need the</font>

401
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:47,039
working group to tell me no but I say if

402
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,929
we do publish it as a pair there should

403
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">be tracked as a pair we should freeze</font>

404
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:52,019
them and let the working group do

405
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:56,699
maintenance on them until they're all

406
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:59,309
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be published it's good idea mr.</font>

407
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,109
Dawkins again if they have if they have

408
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:03,059
cross references they will tend to move

409
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:04,918
together if they have normative

410
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:08,339
cross-references they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tend</font>

411
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,320
to move together as there any reason

412
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:14,009
just to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as well I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

413
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,539
want it one as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I you saw I've</font>

414
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:17,159
voiced the only concern that i had it's

415
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,460
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> major concern and I didn't hear</font>

416
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,839
any concerns in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

417
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,419
would you send a note to the list saying

418
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,039
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we plan to do and for</font>

419
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,419
people to speak up so that you don't

420
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,129
have wasting your time going in the

421
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,170
wrong direction but I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

422
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,670
we should've<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you probably need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

423
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,730
give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a working group known as well if</font>

you're gonna because it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">moment I forgot exactly you do a bit but</font>

426
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:59,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">I do that yes what makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen all</font>

427
00:21:39,510 --> 00:22:00,750
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm I'm done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you so</font>

428
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,100
just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the record as one of the</font>

429
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,790
authors of the other document we find

430
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,740
with you the decision so XO yeah I'm

431
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,990
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this quick it's the min</font>

432
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,700
set it's a pretty small update just for

433
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:16,550
context<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is about the second charter</font>

434
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:19,200
item chartered part that that reads that

435
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,669
well the subset of the transport service

436
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,830
is coming from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first item will be</font>

437
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:26,220
defined here not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the capabilities</font>

438
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:28,350
need to be exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will start with the</font>

439
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,940
caveat I like with a busy statement

440
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,010
about abstraction you know remember

441
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,650
abstraction is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade off so taps is</font>

442
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,320
about identifying more services than we

443
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,790
normally always use identifying all the

444
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,780
things from all the transports at least

445
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,940
we care about here and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> expose all</font>

446
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,649
of that we make all applications happy

447
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,930
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't really achieved very much</font>

448
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,250
if you also expose the choice of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

449
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,160
transport and then we have achieved

450
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:58,110
anything so we need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it possible</font>

451
00:22:53,160 --> 00:23:01,080
for this system<font color="#CCCCCC"> to automatically at them</font>

452
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:04,169
but describe the possibility of hiding

453
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,550
things and this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is about</font>

454
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:10,290
these trade-offs so this is the job that

455
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:12,450
hurts we categorize things as being

456
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,010
functional as optimizing automatable

457
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,020
this is nothing new we have had that

458
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,030
already but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have removed they have</font>

459
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,280
simplified things a little bit so

460
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,649
functional<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be things that you</font>

461
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,330
cannot realize without involving<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

462
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,750
application is just no way that you

463
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:29,370
could ultimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes that or do something</font>

464
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,080
optimizing is something that I mean

465
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,879
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to break if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

466
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you can't reasonably do it without</font>

467
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,980
the application like you know if you

468
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:40,140
don't have you don't for instance here

469
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,280
change dscp<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you could have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nagel for</font>

470
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,880
instance

471
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,620
and automatable is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

472
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,360
that sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> painful so him saying that</font>

473
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,939
primary path for example there may be

474
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,040
situations where a tap system can make a

475
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,920
decision to set the primary path for sss

476
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:59,280
inman SC TP or make decisions about

<font color="#E5E5E5">multi path for certain such decisions on</font>

its own without involving the

00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,350
application no way you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

480
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,430
with unloaded deliveries or this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

481
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:10,409
categorization is what we're looking at

482
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:12,600
multiple changes not very many but small

483
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,580
few things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are worth mentioning so</font>

484
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:19,290
we have made two major decisions in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

485
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:21,360
document one is that well about making

486
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,129
things calling things automatable saying

487
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,290
it's possible to do things with them

488
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">ultimate we are automatic auto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

489
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,980
automatically without involving the

490
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,860
application that would be multi

491
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,080
streaming and multiple paths<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font>

492
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,820
people hate this so that some we have

493
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,169
some this discussion maybe not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

494
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,379
discussion here's we have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

495
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:42,780
other presentations as well but voice

496
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,090
your opinion Oh at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bit active on the</font>

497
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">list maybe there was a category called</font>

498
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,929
deleted I don't want to go into it

499
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we just removed it it turned out</font>

500
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:54,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a redundant thing the now brief</font>

501
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,700
implementation hints everywhere I

502
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,170
believe that this group need more

503
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,850
activity and the hope that we get more

504
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,100
activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we would start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussing</font>

505
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,110
cold and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start discussing out without</font>

506
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dode such a thing so this is where</font>

507
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,990
it begins there are some hints about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

508
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,000
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things could be</font>

509
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented please take a look at them</font>

510
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,930
and tell us that you disagree and it

511
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,100
couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be implemented in that way or</font>

512
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:18,660
maybe you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other way so we have</font>

513
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,820
implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> hence we have some small</font>

514
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,950
fixes that were applied to step three of

515
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,990
the four of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first document but this</font>

516
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:32,520
is like half way of updating to the

517
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:33,750
newer version I think that's it so in

518
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,970
the interest of starting a small

519
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,890
argument just so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're not wasting</font>

520
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,590
our time here looking at slides oh sorry

521
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,870
Brian did you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of small argument I</font>

522
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:46,110
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are fast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough well then I</font>

523
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:47,760
start a big argument let me ask my

524
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,020
question first and if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out that</font>

525
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,690
mine doesn't start an argument you can

526
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">have your trend I'm not small and blow</font>

527
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:57,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">it up so when we say the API</font>

528
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,639
I will expose multi streaming and

529
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,740
multiple paths as automatable functions

530
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:04,178
does that mean to say that it will

531
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,779
prohibit the ability of an application

532
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:09,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to control</font>

533
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,710
multi-stream your multiple paths or just

534
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're going to require that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

535
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,539
application need not do that if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> API</font>

536
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,029
is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of steps is</font>

537
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:20,500
to prohibit anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so</font>

538
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,929
applications that want to get their

539
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,100
fingers into that kind of control will

540
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:25,149
still be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font>

541
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to prohibit but we're going to say oh</font>

542
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:27,699
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make we as a working</font>

543
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:30,399
group are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to make the effort to</font>

544
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,980
expose an API so the apps don't have to

545
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:36,219
if they don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

546
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,600
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any argument</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> JJ I'm trying</font>

547
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:43,269
really hard to have an argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that</font>

548
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,860
was my non argument so thank you think

549
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,320
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that no I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gave meet you oh</font>

550
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,539
so wait a second so is the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

551
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,240
you seeing the documents done absolutely

552
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:54,039
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry very much so where's the</font>

553
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,769
part where you say the stuff they needs

554
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,600
to happen all the stuff that happens

555
00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:00,429
with the first document so this is based

556
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,580
on the first so the first needs is<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

557
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:05,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">grow that's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of sctp FCS that are</font>

558
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,600
not covered in the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP isn't</font>

559
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:09,129
covered in the first all that all that

560
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,779
stuff needs to be incorporated<font color="#CCCCCC"> in not</font>

561
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:11,980
lost because it's all just taking that

562
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,659
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through the list and saying</font>

563
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,700
categorizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and you have people</font>

564
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:19,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">who you think are willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that I</font>

565
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:21,820
do I will do a lot myself I promise so

566
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:23,229
that's a yes we have yeah also<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer for</font>

567
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,658
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the second for the second</font>

568
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:29,529
document so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just me and time but</font>

569
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:30,730
this is less work yeah so this is this

570
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:32,620
going to be less work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I mean</font>

571
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,350
that are very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about updating this</font>

572
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:39,008
one we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to first interrupt it ok so</font>

573
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:41,439
um my comment is like the thing that you

574
00:27:39,009 --> 00:27:43,299
described to iron and I don't describe

575
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,190
to you it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to put it in the</font>

576
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:49,360
document so that we understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

577
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:53,549
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> is automotive elements yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

578
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,549
clear away yeah thank you

579
00:27:54,659 --> 00:28:11,119
sorry we couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue more you know</font>

580
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:11,119
Joe<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't able to be here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Anna</font>

581
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,859
thank you okay hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so I'm a</font>

582
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,419
number instrum and this is a joint work

583
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:26,999
that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

the one that did the majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

588
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,409
work so I'm just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a</font>

589
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:42,239
summary of some of the ongoing research

590
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:44,609
on happy eyeballs that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and</font>

591
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:48,599
in particular to look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost of</font>

592
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:50,970
the mechanism so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is related to the</font>

593
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:53,189
third work item that hopefully people

594
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:56,190
are excited to get to so we have in the

595
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:58,320
shorter that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain how to</font>

596
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:00,149
select and engage an appropriate

597
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,158
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how to discover which</font>

598
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:04,109
protocols are available for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the selected</font>

599
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,389
service between a given pair of

600
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:08,999
endpoints and of course if you're going

601
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:11,219
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and you don't have some I</font>

602
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:14,279
priori knowledge or explicit signaling

603
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,429
the way to find this out the protocol is

604
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:19,590
supported is by trying it out so this

605
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:22,940
calls for some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of happy eyeballs</font>

606
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:25,379
mechanism to solve this problem and

607
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,749
happy eyeballs of course is when we

608
00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:30,330
don't try different alternatives

609
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:32,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">serially because this will take a lot of</font>

610
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and delay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the application</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

611
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:39,749
instead we look at trying multiple

612
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:42,450
transport solutions in parallel so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

613
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:44,279
have done some measurements because if

614
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,440
you're now going to test a number of

615
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:48,479
protocols in parallel this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

616
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,249
be nice for for the delay but it's also

617
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:52,739
going to come with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs right so</font>

618
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:55,049
the aim of these first work has been to

619
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:57,539
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this cost and in particular what</font>

620
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:58,769
is the cost on the server side because

621
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:01,019
you're now going to have to deal with

622
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:02,909
multiple connection attempts in parallel

623
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,279
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this will require some extra</font>

624
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:08,010
processing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as my extra memory at the</font>

625
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:12,090
server potentially

626
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:14,370
so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had some setup some experiments</font>

627
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:18,149
where we have a web server supporting

628
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:20,760
both tcp<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sctp and then the custom</font>

629
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:23,700
web client sounding parallel<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests</font>

630
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,530
using a Bible mechanism and then in the

631
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:30,630
middle you stand emulator to add some

632
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:32,700
delays to the experiments and we looked

633
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,610
at three different test cases so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

634
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:39,810
first one very basic a simplest scenario

635
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:42,270
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have the connection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

636
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:45,300
starch and there is no encryption there

637
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:47,250
is no caching so in the sense this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is</font>

638
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,990
the worst case scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> for happy</font>

639
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,440
eyeballs because every connection

640
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,120
requests results in two connections

641
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,030
going in parallel in this scenario where

642
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">we look at a to protocol protocols and</font>

643
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,889
you also don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of other</font>

644
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,670
processing going on on which you can

645
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:07,950
amortize this this cost and in our

646
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:10,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">experiment we looked at sending these</font>

647
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:12,750
happy eyeballs request varying request

648
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:15,120
rates and we also looked at downloading

649
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:19,130
two different sizes from this web

650
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:21,949
service with 1k page and a 35 k page and

651
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:25,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you here some</font>

652
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:28,920
results for the cpu utilization for

653
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:31,530
memory we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really see any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> major</font>

654
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,290
impact at all but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a paper on it</font>

655
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:36,300
with the full results so this is kind of

656
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:39,810
a teaser to get you interested and then

657
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:44,010
you can read the full paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this</font>

658
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:47,340
is the first basic test scenario that i

659
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:49,830
mentioned where we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no encryption we</font>

660
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,800
have no cash ings we're just sending two

661
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:55,500
requests in parallel and what we have on

662
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,570
the x-axis is these different loads that

663
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,180
I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so something at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

664
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">requests per second or a thousand</font>

665
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,960
requests per shake them and each

666
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,430
experimental rom here last for 10

667
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,860
minutes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a</font>

668
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:11,700
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these and then you see the cpu</font>

669
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:14,129
utilization on your y-axis and the two

670
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,920
colors is the two different objects Isis

671
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:20,340
so the blue one is the 1k bite and the

672
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,029
red one is the 35 k bite and this is

673
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,639
perhaps to look over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

674
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:26,889
the thousand requests per second because

675
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:29,529
then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the largest bars and we can</font>

676
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:32,379
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you just use the graph sears</font>

677
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:34,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">tcp means no happy eyeballs one tcp</font>

678
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:37,389
connection as ATP means no happy

679
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:39,248
eyeballs wellness TP connection and then

680
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:42,758
we compare these two happy eyeballs and

681
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:45,460
with an outcome of<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP being selected so</font>

682
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:48,009
we can see that if we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and</font>

683
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,409
then if we're unhappy eyeballs we're

684
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:52,779
going to increase the cpu utilization it

685
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:54,339
almost doubles here and that's not

686
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:57,639
surprising right because we're sending

687
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:59,529
to request and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is not much work we</font>

688
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:01,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see that already if we increase the</font>

689
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:04,509
size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the page this difference is</font>

690
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:06,879
going to be smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can also see</font>

691
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:09,419
that using a ctp in this case the two

692
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:11,769
protocols differs so you actually have

693
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,289
not much of a difference when you go to

694
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:15,879
the lawyer your page size between

695
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:17,859
getting in a city just using an sctp

696
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:20,830
service or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the eyeballs went out</font>

697
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:22,869
combos<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp so we've seen that already</font>

698
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:27,609
hear the Happy eyeballs is actually not

699
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:31,059
perhaps such a dominating cost so this

700
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:33,580
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first test scenario the tech</font>

701
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:37,570
second test scenario is the same setup

702
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:42,070
but now we are add TLS into the picture

703
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:44,859
so the connection now uses TLS and then

704
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:47,229
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see that well maybe I go back and</font>

705
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:50,649
I show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear that the CPU utilization</font>

706
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:53,229
was about six percent here if we add TLS

707
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:55,988
you see that the CPU utilization goes up

708
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:58,479
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five percent so you can see</font>

709
00:33:55,989 --> 00:34:01,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact of TLS here is much</font>

710
00:33:58,479 --> 00:34:04,029
larger than the impact of happy eyeballs

711
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:06,099
and of course that<font color="#CCCCCC"> also means that we</font>

712
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:08,529
now have a much smaller difference

713
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:11,949
between the protocols here even when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

714
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:14,230
look at the 1k page size it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big</font>

715
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:16,989
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the different</font>

716
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:19,179
mechanisms and this is of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course quite</font>

717
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:21,219
expected right because when we now are

718
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:24,329
doing much more work the cost of doing

719
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:28,239
the extra happy eyeballs is of course

720
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:30,700
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller so then in the third</font>

721
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,859
scenario we add caching into the picture

722
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:34,538
so if you want to implement this of

723
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:35,830
course you wouldn't like to every time

724
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,120
try everything right

725
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,699
want to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're doing</font>

726
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,370
something so if you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

727
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:44,560
protocol succeeds or that the protocol

728
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:47,679
does not succeed you don't need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font>

729
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so if you prefer protocol proceed you</font>

730
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,739
can try<font color="#CCCCCC"> that immediately and maybe not</font>

731
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,210
try the other candidates or if there's

732
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:55,569
something you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work you</font>

733
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:58,330
shouldn't try that every time so we have

734
00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:00,580
now added caching into all the scenarios

735
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:02,890
you saw before so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

736
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:06,640
unencrypted scenario here we have the

737
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:10,299
TLS encrypted scenario the 1k page size

738
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,270
and the 35 k page size and now we don't

739
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,790
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the load</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the x-axis anymore now</font>

740
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:18,009
we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cache hit rate so over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

741
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:19,630
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cache</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hit rate of Siros that</font>

742
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,120
means the case where we try happy

743
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">eyeballs on everything and over in this</font>

744
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,080
end we have a cache hit rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 1 which</font>

745
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you never have to do have the</font>

746
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,540
eyeballs in this case the outcome was

747
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:34,450
always a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then here arranged</font>

748
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:37,480
between them so this is 0.8 it's very

749
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:41,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to see in the slide but 60.6 0.4</font>

750
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:44,080
0.2 and perhaps if we look at this

751
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:48,370
scenario because this was the case where

752
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:51,460
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a it's easiest to see of course</font>

753
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:53,230
if you add the caching this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

754
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">help you because now you're not going to</font>

755
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:59,320
have to do the happy eyeballs mechanism

756
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:02,950
all the time so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look over here at</font>

757
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:05,380
the pouring the eight eighty percent

758
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,839
cache hit rate you you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

759
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:11,680
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between using happy eyeballs</font>

760
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:14,440
or not it's not really big and of course

761
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">if we go to the TLS encrypted case here</font>

762
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,220
it's already a smaller difference

763
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,410
between the protocol you see some impact

764
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:23,319
of the caching but it's already quite

765
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:26,140
similar and if you're wondering at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

766
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,180
different three balls here that is the

767
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">outcome of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the happy eyeballs mechanism</font>

768
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,460
so in the previous graphs it was always

769
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP that one here we also have added so</font>

770
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:39,610
TCP being the winner as<font color="#E5E5E5"> City fifty</font>

771
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:42,850
percent of the time so either<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

772
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:44,650
protocols can win or<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a ctp being</font>

773
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,660
the winner so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> showing that</font>

774
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,480
you have some difference also in the

775
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,430
over

776
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,260
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on where in the cpu</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> load</font>

777
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:58,180
depending on which which protocol you

778
00:36:51,260 --> 00:37:02,240
are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this was a very quick</font>

779
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:05,600
summary<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of the results from from</font>

780
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,089
this measurements and I think the

781
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,580
conclusions from the results that we see

782
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:12,830
so far is that it's feasible to use

783
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,869
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyeballs as a transport protocol</font>

784
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,210
selection<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanisms because you can</font>

785
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:19,310
amortize over the cost of all the work

786
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:23,869
for the connection and with caching you

787
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:26,990
can also reduce the load quite a bit so

788
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:29,750
the experiments here was was done you

789
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,819
know as a separate component as I showed

790
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,670
you with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> standalone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday with</font>

791
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:37,100
custom web client and and the server so

792
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:40,700
we're also now building this happy

793
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:42,770
eyeballs mechanism into the neat system

794
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,319
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned also on the previous</font>

795
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:47,150
slide here that we're building in the

796
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,330
this neat project which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> taps like</font>

797
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:53,359
system and the code is also available

798
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:55,160
here so with that of course we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

799
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,740
do more extensive evaluations also

800
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:04,879
measure in in real networks and we also

801
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:06,500
submitted first very rough draft of the

802
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,109
happy eyeballs framework so this is

803
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,119
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we will update and</font>

804
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:13,069
continue working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we of course</font>

805
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,119
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for feedback but we will also come</font>

806
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:19,190
back with a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> polish versions and</font>

807
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:25,550
that you know on the list when those are

808
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:30,260
becoming available questions hi Tommy

809
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:31,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Paulie Apple so how how parallel RVs are</font>

810
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,180
these completely parallel exactly the

811
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:37,880
same time attempts between both yeah

812
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah so just coming from our</font>

813
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,310
experience with<font color="#CCCCCC"> v4b</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six classic happy</font>

814
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:46,369
eyeballs and having<font color="#CCCCCC"> done our</font>

815
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:50,330
implementation we found the staggered

816
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:54,320
race kind of mitigates a lot of the

817
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:56,569
factors of overhead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU so is there</font>

818
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">a way that we so in those cases we can</font>

819
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,720
guess from like previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT which one</font>

820
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,820
we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is faster and just try the</font>

821
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,379
one wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> until we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it should have</font>

822
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,230
finished and then kick off the next and

823
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has a very high success rate for us</font>

824
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:12,180
is there something we could do similar

825
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:13,740
for protocols here of guests

826
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:18,000
historically which one we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

827
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:20,959
better and and race them a little bit

828
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,100
staggered so what we're actually

829
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,040
suggesting in the in the draft and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

830
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,900
the framework for it is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

831
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,160
some notion of which protocol will

832
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,650
provide you with the best service

833
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,270
whether this comes from from knowledge

834
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:36,750
of what the application needs or some

835
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:40,670
policy system or so you actually try the

836
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:43,320
preferred transport a little bit before

837
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,930
the next transport<font color="#CCCCCC"> so kind of having a</font>

838
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,420
priority for what you would like you

839
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,190
know that outcome to be so that you have

840
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,390
some if the best protocol doesn't work

841
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,670
you have a fallback that you have

842
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:55,500
initiated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the small time delays you</font>

843
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:58,680
don't have to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the entire</font>

844
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,360
connection and the very long you keep

845
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">delai you can get if you have to wait</font>

846
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">for it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to completely fade it would be</font>

847
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">great if in addition to kind of like the</font>

848
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,779
a priori preference you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have</font>

849
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,580
some type of learning mechanism of

850
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,300
course so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to combine</font>

851
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:16,799
with the caching right so if you have

852
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,720
protocols that didn't succeed and you

853
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,490
have recently tried them then I think

854
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,589
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not try those at all and then</font>

855
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually you have to time out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

856
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:27,860
that you you know probe it at regular

857
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,170
intervals but clearly you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

858
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any similarly if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have your</font>

859
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:36,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">preferred protocol was just successful</font>

860
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,950
then maybe it's enough to just try<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

861
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,750
try to start with because if you haven't

862
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,060
released the delay should be much larger

863
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:44,040
before you start to open another

864
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,290
connection attempt so so definitely this

865
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,400
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we plan to have in the</font>

866
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:52,140
framework so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

867
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,210
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that at the moment is</font>

868
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,879
to have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of priority between</font>

869
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:58,680
these solutions that we combined with

870
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,120
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the caching information does that</font>

871
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,609
sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a good approach you do you</font>

872
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:08,520
have suggestions for other ways to

873
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:10,410
manage this timing<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh it's teams fries</font>

874
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh I'm not going to answer the question</font>

875
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,319
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make some trouble um</font>

876
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:18,249
that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

877
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,019
I mean I I like this idea of frying<font color="#CCCCCC"> hot</font>

878
00:41:18,249 --> 00:41:22,448
Bibles take thing for transport

879
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:24,368
selection how does happy eyeballs

880
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:25,630
operating the transport layer and

881
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:27,729
through play with hoppy eyeballs

882
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:30,729
operating in the network layer on how do

883
00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:33,549
you race different things happening at

884
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:36,848
the same time yes I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

885
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:39,339
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> combine these right in some way so</font>

886
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:42,089
right on i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was talking to folks</font>

887
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:44,650
about this earlier but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that uh</font>

888
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:48,069
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time applications you do</font>

889
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:49,809
this is with ace which is for

890
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:51,670
connectivity establishment son gets you

891
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:54,009
into a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> messy place are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the really</font>

892
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:56,890
nasty algorithm with lots of preferences

893
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:58,479
specifies my wonder if it gets as messy

894
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:01,420
as that or if there is an easier thing

895
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:03,609
we can come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tubs I think it</font>

896
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:07,599
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what so which protocols you</font>

897
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:10,180
have to select<font color="#E5E5E5"> between right but but</font>

898
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is a messy case and that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

899
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,719
not worked that out so this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

900
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:17,709
reason we started with<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and sctp</font>

901
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:19,959
there tell me probably Apple again just

902
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:21,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">in regards to that we have a bit of</font>

903
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:24,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience with double happy I balls</font>

904
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:27,640
between not transports but between

905
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:28,930
address families and then interfaces so

906
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,749
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> double levels of that</font>

907
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:34,839
and if you do it carefully it can be

908
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:36,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so yeah I think it'd be good to</font>

909
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:38,229
specify something like if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing</font>

910
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:40,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that beneath just make sure they're kind</font>

911
00:42:38,229 --> 00:42:42,279
of independent layers you don't have to

912
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,019
but we're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's going to</font>

913
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:45,609
be yet another this isn't this is

914
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,749
additive I know exactly so this is like

915
00:42:45,609 --> 00:42:50,920
a third<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer so you could have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

916
00:42:46,749 --> 00:42:52,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">giant trees but ideally your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

917
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,449
attempts and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> sctp attempts or</font>

918
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:57,549
whatever if they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have their own</font>

919
00:42:55,449 --> 00:43:00,940
happy eyeballs for v4 v6 that's

920
00:42:57,549 --> 00:43:04,869
completely up to them right it's kind of

921
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:07,059
abstract it that layer oh good we're

922
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:10,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting a discussion going but now I'm</font>

923
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:14,440
worrying about time so so please try to

924
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:17,170
be brief oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'll just Ice</font>

925
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,289
met today<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group which does</font>

926
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:22,839
the internet interactivity<font color="#E5E5E5"> connector via</font>

927
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:25,119
salvation and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

928
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:27,009
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually a lot of ongoing</font>

929
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,350
discussion around that so

930
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:32,260
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> column Jennings ran an</font>

931
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:35,380
experiment where he bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

932
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:38,790
nap Nats and it ran a test and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said</font>

933
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:42,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he could basically paste the the</font>

934
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:45,160
the checks at five second intervals and

935
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:48,220
they all went<font color="#CCCCCC"> through but what they</font>

936
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:51,220
found out was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're about thirty</font>

937
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:54,850
six candidates pairs for each address

938
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:56,770
family so there were 72 total checks

939
00:43:54,850 --> 00:44:00,250
that needed to be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for ipv4</font>

940
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:02,590
ipv6 and they have like real eight

941
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,510
candidates and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth and they</font>

942
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:06,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">found out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you did this there</font>

943
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:10,030
would be one megabit per second<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

944
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:11,230
connectivity traffic look like a fight

945
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,330
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning of look like there's</font>

946
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:16,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing even started you just put call</font>

947
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:18,520
and this starts<font color="#CCCCCC"> up right so so the group</font>

948
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:20,620
through went through a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussion</font>

949
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,960
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> this UDP and it's not</font>

950
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:25,390
congestion control so basically you

951
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,210
could the only thing that's controlling

952
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:32,259
the whole checks is the timer like<font color="#CCCCCC"> da</font>

953
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:35,080
that's the timer in the 5245 so like

954
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,520
coming back to here at least it's a

955
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,200
tractable problem the sense that there

956
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,060
are some transports here which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like</font>

957
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP and sctp which are congestion</font>

958
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,710
control so when you send out these

959
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,880
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hoping that they are like</font>

960
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:51,310
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the congestion control</font>

961
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,760
behavior but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have AI wo 10 and</font>

962
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:57,700
you could actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> send out a lot of</font>

963
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:02,140
packets so so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the connection</font>

964
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:04,629
setup so you unless you want unless you

965
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:08,350
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fast open you're not gonna have</font>

966
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:09,670
data in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scene but yeah yeah it</font>

967
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:12,069
depends on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connectivity in the</font>

968
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:14,260
case of ice there is a stand<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pakistan</font>

969
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:15,910
packet has a lot of days yeah I was

970
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,970
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP unless it's Larry case</font>

971
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:21,129
so I think the question again if you

972
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:23,259
have 72 candidates here to address

973
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:25,330
families and then you had UDP and TCP

974
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,280
and sctp you can just do the math to

975
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:29,350
figure out like 72 times<font color="#CCCCCC"> three in this</font>

976
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,400
case and that's a lot of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

977
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:34,900
through and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what we're looking</font>

978
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,680
for is if you come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the guidance</font>

979
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:40,760
here then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ice Cube</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically like take</font>

980
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,680
that guidance from here into their work

981
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,880
group so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a relevant</font>

982
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion to have and actually how you</font>

983
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,890
do the connectivity checks for whatever

984
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:57,410
case may be it it is guidance to other

985
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:59,960
groups compact<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah I came of age</font>

986
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:04,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">sex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean a lot like however in just</font>

987
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,990
finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> um this is essentially ice that</font>

988
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,370
the bits are encoded in a different way

989
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:11,930
but you're essentially running the same

990
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:18,130
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bro the this clearly scope for</font>

991
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:20,480
some cooperation angry Michael you

992
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,850
mycotoxin just wanted to know note that

993
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,090
at least the<font color="#E5E5E5"> need project what we do is</font>

994
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:28,160
we control the protocol selection of the

995
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,860
transport and network layer completely

996
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,680
so we don't just let the operating

997
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:35,270
system choose we choose explicitly we

998
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,210
want to test this all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over you for your</font>

999
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:40,940
honored estes or v6 and try to avoid

1000
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:43,580
these two layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interaction which we</font>

1001
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:46,430
can't control so that's that's the way

1002
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:48,290
we approaching this their control the

1003
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:54,740
stuff we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are aware of this and we</font>

1004
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:58,300
control it and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something thank</font>

1005
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:58,299
you Anna<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

1006
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:27,869
Brian oh um sorry sighs so um hi I'm

1007
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,240
Brian travel i'm going to give a very

1008
00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:31,590
quick talk about something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1009
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,669
mentioned the microphone at the last

1010
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:38,369
meeting called post sockets um the idea

1011
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:39,600
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really a lot of the work that</font>

1012
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:42,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're trying to do here to make</font>

1013
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,799
everything more flexible is kind of

1014
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:46,529
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the fact that we're using</font>

yesterday interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> stock scream right</font>

1016
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,950
like I said at the plenary last night

00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:54,030
for the people who didn't have better

1018
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:55,680
dinner plans um we have a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

1019
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,090

1021
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,330
excellent protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> of getting a tape</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">from one side of the room to the other</font>

1023
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,460
but you know you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1024
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,480
problems we're scaling<font color="#E5E5E5"> a protocol and</font>

1025
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,190
we're also running into problems with

00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,930
scaling the interface<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's synchronous</font>

1030
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,830
you can measure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but everything is</font>

1032
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:17,040
look like a file<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to say</font>

1033
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a bad idea this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,300
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everybody who could program</font>

1038
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,900
we have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet it's also a reason</font>

1039
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,900
we have an internet security problem

1040
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,780
fortunately about 15 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1041
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,490

<font color="#CCCCCC">room came up with shock stream which is</font>

1043
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:39,089
yesterday's interface today right we can

1044
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,609
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this it's still synchronous</font>

1045
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,840
uh nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cares about unicast</font>

1046
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:44,490
though is in multicast routing

1047
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,050
insecurity or too hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's like</font>

1048
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:47,819
you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say multicast three times and</font>

1049
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:50,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron is like you declares the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> popover</font>

1050
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:52,470
um there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no framing support but nobody</font>

1051
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,060
cares because the lack of framing

1052
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,649
support in<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP means anything that runs</font>

1053
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,619
over TCP that needs framing support

1054
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,150
invented it anyway um<font color="#E5E5E5"> single stream hi</font>

1055
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:01,560
you know what actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just open</font>

1056
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,740
multiple flows we forget this out as

1057
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,570
soon as we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> admitting browsers um</font>

1058
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:08,368
MP TCP looks like it's actually

1059
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:10,530
deploying so that fixes the single path

1060
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:11,700
problem and TLS and open SSL solve all

1061
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,890
of our problems so we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1062
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,450
worry about security right we're still

1063
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:16,830
missing a path abstraction and the

1064
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is can we do better than this</font>

1065
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,700
um

1066
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:26,009
so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> seat pocket it</font>

1067
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,570
actually sort of fixes most of these

1068
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,590
problems eat unicast multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

1069
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:31,020
framing support single<font color="#CCCCCC"> or multiple</font>

1070
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,790
stream you get multipath for failover

1071
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,140
but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually control it so you</font>

1072
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,520
can also do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bandwidth cheering</font>

1073
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,740
stolen security still know pop

1074
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,020
obstruction it is bound to the sctp

1075
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,310
which is not super deployable in the

1076
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,900
opener today unless you run it over

1077
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:44,520
something like the thing that we were

1078
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:48,930
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to invent this morning but won't</font>

1079
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:51,360
be able to for a few more<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATF cycles so</font>

1080
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:52,560
um these are insights that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had while</font>

1081
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,600
staring at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem which might also</font>

1082
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,590
just be silly assumptions um silly

1083
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,180
assumption number one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1084
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:59,190
applications deal and objects of

1085
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,600
arbitrary size there are a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

1086
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,520
when you actually do have to stream

1087
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,660
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one side of like when</font>

1088
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,710
you're when you actually have the

1089
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,580
problem that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tape and you're</font>

1090
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to the other side of the</font>

1091
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">room you don't know how much more tape</font>

1092
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:10,710
you have right so sometimes you're

1093
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,240
actually streaming things often you're

1094
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,380
not often<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know how big the objects</font>

1095
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,419
are or can come up with a stream of

1096
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,070
objects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are of the same size this</font>

1097
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:22,440
is how we've done video over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP by the</font>

1098
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:23,610
way um we keep saying multipath people

1099
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,050
jump up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus this morning said</font>

1100
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,520
multipass multipass multipass and we

1101
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,770
said yes yes yes i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the network of</font>

1102
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,750
the future is explicitly multipath it's

1103
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:32,340
not going to be about<font color="#E5E5E5"> often that users</font>

1104
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,810
or servers have only one route out to

1105
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,310
the network I've heard of crazy people

1106
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:39,540
already running bgp all the way to the

<font color="#CCCCCC">top of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rack switches um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that</font>

1108
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,720
basically saying and this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1109
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,280
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we talked about when we were</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">putting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the taps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transports document</font>

1111
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,810
saying that um security is not really a

1112
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,340
property of transport that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a property</font>

1113
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,299
of some operator<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,560
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away with that now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1115
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">future transports have to guarantee</font>

1116
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,119
these properties the fourth thing which

1117
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,470
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> harder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do on the api side is that</font>

1118
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,480
message resumption is inherently

scalable programming works right now

1135
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's enabling this asynchronous</font>

1136
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,910
programming and some of them even

1137
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:35,910
actually require you to

1138
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:37,319
a synchronously um I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shorten</font>

1139
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:40,200
my talk so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through</font>

1140
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,580
this slide this is basically this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

1141
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:44,609
is an advertisement<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read this slide</font>

1142
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:47,310
this is my it's obvious if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stare at</font>

1143
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">it for a couple of seconds um there are</font>

1144
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:51,330
some boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also have some lines</font>

1145
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:53,580
um the idea here is there's an

1146
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:55,200
association the association has some you

1147
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,460
can send some objects the<font color="#CCCCCC"> association</font>

1148
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,140
and then there are some events that come

1149
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,560
off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can bind handlers and</font>

1150
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:03,420
stuff and this is intended to start a

1151
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,779
discussion about if we were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1152
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:10,230
throw it all out and start over knowing

1153
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,880
now what we wish we had known then with

1154
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:13,470
the programming models that we have now

1155
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the hardware that we have now in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1156
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:17,939
operating systems that we have now what

1157
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:20,610
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> it look like it would have very</font>

1158
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:24,630
nice rounded lines and be notated in

1159
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:25,890
gill sans um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to go</font>

1160
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:29,190
through these either i'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1161
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:32,700
through these either um why am I talking

1162
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:34,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this in taps taps allows you to</font>

1163
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,299
select transport protocols but if each

1164
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:39,090
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those transport protocols inherently</font>

1165
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,950
needs its own API to deal with right so

1166
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:43,380
if you're writing to sock street or sock

1167
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:46,109
seek packet and you get TCP there's got

1168
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:48,000
to be a shim layer that makes DCP look

1169
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:51,960
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> socks epacket and yeah so if you're</font>

1170
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:55,170
trying to to UM to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need an</font>

1171
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,940
API a single API that runs over all of

1172
00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:00,210
these transport protocols no matter what

1173
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:02,520
their um no matter what their properties

1174
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:04,380
are the neat API is one solution to this

1175
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,630
problem it looks a lot like current

1176
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,040
api's um that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a pretty good</font>

1177
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:10,740
way to go about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

1178
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,630
minimally disrupt existing application

1179
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:15,149
programming but if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

1180
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:17,310
to touch the implication application

1181
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:19,470
anyway why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> go with this more radical</font>

1182
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:20,820
approach anyone who's interested in

1183
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,919
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this unfortunately I</font>

1184
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:25,340
haven't had<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to work on this since</font>

1185
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:29,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time I mention it the mic</font>

1186
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:32,280
please um this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wish I had a paper</font>

1187
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:34,259
published to point at this actually call

1188
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,030
and publish most of the paper because

1189
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,960
this is like three quarters of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the TCP</font>

1190
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,070
Hollywood thing is that what you're

1191
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,920
going to say

1192
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:46,920
yeah read<font color="#CCCCCC"> Collins paper about my awesome</font>

1193
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:48,960
API um I guess we have like three

1194
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,040
seconds for questions or because I want

1195
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,240
I want Steven to get up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1196
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:55,680
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Colin peigans yeah I</font>

1197
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,950
was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say what he said I was</font>

1198
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,299
about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say if if you add deadlines</font>

1199
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:02,100
you've got something the looks very like

1200
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation that Steven will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1201
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:06,509
doing yeah excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also wanted to</font>

1202
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:09,480
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> um Clark contenant house</font>

1203
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:12,420
application-level framing there's me

1204
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,610
week all deadlines lifetimes sorry again

1205
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:19,710
Clark contenant house application-level

1206
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:22,160
framing sitcom 1980 mumble yeah okay I

1207
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:24,810
gotta go read some stuff thank you I

1208
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:28,500
mean only send me that can you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> me at</font>

1209
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:30,930
least in Clark and who oh that one yeah

1210
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:36,090
okay yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> baby architectural concessions</font>

1211
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:38,640
new generation protocols yep tell me

1212
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:39,930
Polly Apple um I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1213
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,400
like your model i think it's very

1214
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:45,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar to a lot of what we're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1215
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,920
think the tricky thing will be getting

1216
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,720
everyone to agree on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and actually</font>

1217
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,260
having something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people use so i</font>

1218
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,509
think it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be important to early on get</font>

1219
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,580
a discussion group going of people who

1220
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,780
are actually implementing the stacks

1221
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,850
that people are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> for networking</font>

1222
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:02,820
I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> some conversations this week</font>

1223
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:05,640
with people about doing that and so we

1224
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:08,160
should loop this group in with that

1225
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,100
group yeah sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent awesome</font>

1226
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,770
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you Brian thanks a</font>

1227
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:15,299
lot um I forgot to mention at the

1228
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,830
beginning i dint because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had sent</font>

1229
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,200
email to the list that we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1230
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:21,270
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably about 10 minutes over that</font>

1231
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,580
we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> last minute talk that came up</font>

1232
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the applied networking research</font>

1233
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:28,560
workshop on saturday and so we're

1234
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:33,990
squeezing it in except is<font color="#CCCCCC"> phillip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ear oh</font>

1235
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:37,890
good yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just FYI bits and bytes</font>

1236
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:40,020
doesn't start for 20 minutes wait I

1237
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:43,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one more oh yeah what's</font>

1238
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:44,790
the last one well as long as oh steven

1239
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,380
oh that's the last one right so it's not

1240
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:50,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Phillip it's Steven who's the last okay</font>

1241
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:53,770
no pressure Phil

1242
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">nopers five-minute talk okay fine so</font>

1243
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:58,329
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk about socket</font>

1244
00:55:55,540 --> 00:56:01,660
attempts this is our try to automate

1245
00:55:58,329 --> 00:56:07,359
something namely the excess election

1246
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:09,730
problem on yesterday's API and trying to

1247
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:11,859
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this um you really need some</font>

1248
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:14,109
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the most valuable</font>

1249
00:56:11,859 --> 00:56:16,029
information you could have for excess

1250
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:18,160
election is the question what's the

1251
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:21,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do with this socket</font>

1252
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:25,328
it's now opening and thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

1253
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:27,550
the obvious answer is applications no

1254
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:31,750
more than they can express using today's

1255
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:35,290
socket API namely nothing so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

1256
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:39,730
something like a web browser its most

1257
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:41,800
probably knowing what aprox with me

1258
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,630
which size of an object is festering or

1259
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,940
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a video screaming to note</font>

1260
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:49,660
knowing it could tell to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the socket API</font>

1261
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:52,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">arm I'm trying to download something</font>

1262
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:54,578
that will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a constant flow or mall</font>

1263
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:56,800
as consul bursty flow of information and

1264
00:56:54,579 --> 00:57:01,300
not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will just fetch 20</font>

1265
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:03,849
bytes um so how could this look like and

1266
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:07,450
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> joint workers to either where</font>

1267
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:10,750
we've thought about how could this look

1268
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:12,970
like and that basic idea is so the

1269
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:16,690
application specifies something or very

1270
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:18,879
rough men are saying on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will know this</font>

1271
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:21,160
is something like a screaming later or

1272
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,970
this is something like about<font color="#E5E5E5"> download or</font>

1273
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:27,609
just some control for Chet flow

1274
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:31,410
something like I know this file I'm

1275
00:57:27,609 --> 00:57:34,480
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to download it has 10 megabytes</font>

1276
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:37,299
whether I care<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the data grams will</font>

1277
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,569
be delivered timely or weather delay is

1278
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,460
more or less no matter for me which

1279
00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:44,740
betrayed<font color="#CCCCCC"> a duration</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is stream might have</font>

1280
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:47,530
and how resilient the transport should

1281
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:51,578
be so do I really care about packet loss

1282
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:53,890
or respect or something yeah I will care

1283
00:57:51,579 --> 00:57:55,630
about by doing retransmission because

1284
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:58,180
the operating system update nobody sees

1285
00:57:55,630 --> 00:58:01,280
with it will alive 10 mins later enough

1286
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:04,609
um um

1287
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:07,520
this got us to table of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas how</font>

1288
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:10,100
this category's could look like skip

1289
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:13,610
about that and employing this the

1290
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:16,130
question is how to do this um we started

1291
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:18,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the original DC Circuit ABI was</font>

1292
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:20,030
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the most problem the best</font>

1293
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,370
place to implement business as a sock

1294
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:26,030
adoption this is the most the least

1295
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:28,339
invasive way to do this um and first got

1296
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:30,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">them and modified all socket basic</font>

1297
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:33,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">socket calls to include a context where</font>

1298
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:36,169
we could find the cults together because

1299
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:40,160
this call really just loosely covered

1300
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:42,020
with um later on when trick trying to

1301
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,730
solve the problem on how to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as</font>

1302
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:47,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm currently we found out would have</font>

1303
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:51,590
been sufficient to change get other info

1304
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:54,410
in a way that we can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this</font>

1305
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:57,650
information and afterwards returned the

1306
00:58:54,410 --> 00:59:00,230
information like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> um the saga</font>

1307
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:03,230
represent the socket set and the bind

1308
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:08,060
address the application should bind so

1309
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:11,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">for doing the excess election um the</font>

1310
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:13,640
next question<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked ourselves okay if</font>

1311
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:16,340
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this for web browser we</font>

1312
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,440
did connection or use and doing this

1313
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:21,230
connector easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> also said we want to</font>

1314
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:23,390
automate this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is also</font>

1315
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:27,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">some point to take into account if we</font>

1316
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:31,850
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do connection we use we need</font>

1317
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:34,340
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a more different API we</font>

1318
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:36,910
need something to first do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1319
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:39,860
yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to connect to a host and</font>

1320
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:42,109
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this socket call that gets</font>

1321
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:44,930
everything the usual socket call to get

1322
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:47,360
at one place and you see this Reverend

1323
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:51,770
all mostly all applications that are

1324
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:54,380
using sockets um and you need something

1325
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:55,850
that can do connection you're so is say

1326
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:59,270
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to connect to the following</font>

1327
00:59:55,850 --> 01:00:00,830
host port I have the following

1328
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:03,110
properties of the connection and please

1329
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:06,310
give me a socket that I can reuse or

1330
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:10,400
give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new one if I there is no</font>

1331
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:12,500
suitable socket already open and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

1332
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,420
having this cause we can't really speed

1333
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:17,089
up HTTP a little bit

1334
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:19,549
um and take the burden from implementing

1335
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:21,349
the whole exes election and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

application to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of socket API</font>

1339
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:32,000
automatically which is really nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1340
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:34,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">after socket release that frees the saga</font>

1341
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,130
blows it I don't mind yeah there's

1342
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:39,740
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> section so if you want to play</font>

1343
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:44,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">around with it a little bit um there's a</font>

1344
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:46,848
profitable on get up uh with including

1345
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:51,349
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sub</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> review stuff and we release the</font>

1346
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:55,690
most recent version 0 dot five yesterday

1347
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:59,030
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play around have fun</font>

1348
01:00:55,690 --> 01:01:02,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you just don't be kind we can</font>

1349
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a quick question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> families coming ok</font>

1350
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:10,130
if anybody is determined to leave now go

1351
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:17,559
ahead so that we don't interrupt<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steven</font>

1352
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:17,559
in in his talk yeah thanks guys my cogs

1353
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:23,660
x he goes even remember your between

1354
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:28,308
this room and free beer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i well no</font>

1355
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:30,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i'm stephen kristin</font>

1356
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:33,950
and i'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about transport</font>

1357
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:36,109
services for<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time applications so</font>

1358
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:37,700
the approach of the working rip so far

1359
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:40,279
for defending transport services has

1360
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:42,379
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat bottom-up and so we've</font>

1361
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,490
been looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> transfer protocols I've</font>

1362
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,170
been standardized and we've been

1363
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:46,700
breaking them down into transfer of

1364
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:48,740
services that these protocols per<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1365
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:50,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">now the approach that we take in this</font>

1366
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:52,009
work is as a top-down approach we look

1367
01:01:50,569 --> 01:01:55,099
at the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we walk down</font>

1368
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards transport layer and determine</font>

1369
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:58,549
what transport service is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1370
01:01:56,450 --> 01:02:00,470
application needs and we do that

1371
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:02,390
specifically for real-time multimedia

1372
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:03,770
applications so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking what</font>

1373
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:05,990
services to real-time multimedia

1374
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:07,220
applications need and then we're taking

1375
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:08,779
that and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> following it down to the</font>

1376
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:10,399
transport layer and determining how we

1377
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:14,420
can provide those transport services

1378
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:16,460
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> existing transport protocols so</font>

1379
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:18,650
just a quick note about these

1380
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:21,530
applications they're characterized by a

1381
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:23,390
maximum delay bound and for interactive

1382
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:25,369
applications that's in the low hundreds

1383
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:26,299
of milliseconds so for voice for example

1384
01:02:25,369 --> 01:02:27,540
it's it's a couple of hundred

1385
01:02:26,299 --> 01:02:29,700
milliseconds

1386
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:32,490
that's based on human perception so

1387
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:35,370
above<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adalia both 200 milliseconds and</font>

1388
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:37,799
the interactivity breaks down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> user</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">start to notice for non interactive</font>

1390
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:42,030
applications the delay bounders in the

1391
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,230
tens of seconds and that's based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1392
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:46,740
desired experience that we want to

1393
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:47,850
provide users ultimately the services

1394
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,310
that we specify for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these applications</font>

1395
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:52,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to respect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this maximum</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Talib</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> owned</font>

1397
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:56,490
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time add as little licenses they</font>

1398
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:58,770
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that we've got more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the</font>

1399
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:01,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">later to use up at the other layers of</font>

1400
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:03,180
the stack so that's the applications and

1401
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,820
so will define a set of transport

1402
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:07,410
services that these applications need

1403
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:09,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of these as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attaining and</font>

1404
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:11,879
deadlines service so again deter has a

1405
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:14,040
set time by which an intuitive arrived

1406
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,890
to be useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the application so an</font>

1407
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,720
IPTV application for example has frames

1408
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:20,460
of video and each frame has got a 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1409
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:23,580
which instead of arrived<font color="#CCCCCC"> fee to be used</font>

1410
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:26,040
and once were past that time once the

1411
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:28,770
frame arrives it will not be used by the

1412
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:30,029
receiving application if the transport

1413
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:32,130
layer doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about this deadline</font>

1414
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:34,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">then we run the risk of sending data</font>

1415
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:36,210
that's that's effectively useless so so

1416
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,770
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to do is estimate the</font>

1417
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:40,230
likelihood that this data will arrive on

1430
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,520
reliability so we know the IP gives us

our best effort packet delivery service

1432
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:13,380
and so some packets will will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost</font>

1433
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:15,480
and we know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this timeless</font>

01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,280
after which it will effectively become

1436
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,620

01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:31,830

then introduce a sub streams service so

01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,690
these applications are often comprised

1463
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:21,180
of two or more<font color="#CCCCCC"> subfloors or an audio</font>

stream service to do so partial

reliability means that some messages

1469
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:34,530
will arrive successfully but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

1470
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:36,899
at applications there's often

1471
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:39,210
interdependencies amongst the data so an

1472
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:41,789
MPEG one application for example has IP

1473
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:44,869
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> b frames and dependencies between</font>

1474
01:05:41,789 --> 01:05:47,579
those so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have got an iframe with a</font>

1477
01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:52,319

1478
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:54,510
because it's dependent on data that

01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:55,650
would have arrived of course utility is

1480
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:57,960
quite difficult to define for these

congestion control algorithm for the

1491
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:23,130
application to use we just simply say

1492
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be used and that the</font>

1495
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:31,319
finally we've got our connections

<font color="#E5E5E5">orientated service and acute live</font>

1498

scenarios for explicitly setting up and

1499
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:40,828
tearing down in network state and so

1500
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,020
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this set of transport services</font>

1506
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:54,368
are the two optional ones as well and so

1507
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,289
we need some way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating these</font>

1508
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:58,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">services at the transport layer so if we</font>

1509
01:06:56,289 --> 01:07:00,640
provided them a new DP and we can see

1510
01:06:58,809 --> 01:07:03,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">that UDP already supports a message</font>

1511
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:05,230

01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,250
make it add some headers and other

01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,599
mechanisms<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that and we'll need to</font>

1518
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:18,720
add an estimate of the one we networked

1519

early and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that function as well</font>

1520
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,209
adding substream support means that we

provide some of these services over UDP

more interestingly though we we look at

how we can provide them over<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp and tcp</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what we don't do is always send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCPS</font>

1560
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:55,778
that the payload that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

1561
01:08:53,649 --> 01:08:58,358
associated with that segment so as the

1562
01:08:55,779 --> 01:08:59,889
payload for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp retransmission will</font>

1563
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:01,839
arrive<font color="#CCCCCC"> by its deadline then we'll swap</font>

1564
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,380
for another message<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will arrive by</font>

1565
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,330
its deadline

1566
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:06,730
unless the mechanism called inconsistent

1567
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:08,139
retransmissions we've done some

1568
01:09:06,729 --> 01:09:10,750
small-scale evaluations with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1569
01:09:08,139 --> 01:09:13,420
prototype<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP Hollywood and some other</font>

1570
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:15,488
people have done evaluations of

1571
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:18,399
inconsistent retransmissions and largely

1572
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:19,988
it seems to work there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some cases</font>

1573
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,519
where we see cashing in the network and

1574
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:24,790
we we get the original instead of the

1575
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:28,420
new version but broadly that say<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure</font>

1576
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:29,859
modes for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mechanism and so in</font>

1577
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:31,389
summary then we've defined a set of

1578
01:09:29,859 --> 01:09:33,310
transport services from real-time

1579
01:09:31,389 --> 01:09:34,810
multimedia applications and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> shown</font>

1580
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:37,449
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these services can be provided over</font>

1581
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:39,250
both UDP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP ultimately that allows</font>

1582
01:09:37,448 --> 01:09:41,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">us to use UDP in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of cases</font>

1583
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:45,310
but fall back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and provide the</font>

1584
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:47,169
same services as well so this was part

1585
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:48,670
of a paper that was published at the

1586
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:51,339
applied networking research workshop

1587
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:52,658
last weekend and so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> encouraged you to</font>

1588
01:09:51,339 --> 01:09:54,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">go to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> workshop website and you'll</font>

1589
01:09:52,658 --> 01:09:57,610
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full paper and the sides for the</font>

1590
01:09:54,460 --> 01:10:10,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">full top as well and that is good thank</font>

1591
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:13,750
you Michael Jackson um and after stuff

1592
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:20,730
you can get with<font color="#CCCCCC"> SCDP using your setp</font>

1593
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:20,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">and yes a summer api to PR sctp yeah</font>

1594
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:26,349
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steven this is really awesome</font>

1595
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:28,210
stuff um it sounds like you're actually

1596
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:30,340
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafted to get into the group</font>

1597
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:31,960
of people on the stack side and also on

1598
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:36,010
the application side to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

1599
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:39,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this better I i I'm a little</font>

1600
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:41,050
skeptical of the of the mechanism that

1601
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:44,400
you're using to support partial

1602
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:47,139
reliability I'd really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to see a</font>

1603
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,509
larger scale measurement of that yeah um

1604
01:10:47,139 --> 01:10:51,370
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know this but I want to</font>

1605
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:53,889
say it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room please please</font>

1606
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:56,500
consider um if you have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1607
01:10:53,889 --> 01:10:58,870
run something bigger go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do it</font>

1608
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:02,469
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit it to map Reggie um if you</font>

1609
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:04,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't send mail to the map orgy at RT</font>

1610
01:11:02,469 --> 01:11:06,010
after a toric list and ask for help

1611
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:08,380
because this seems like a really

1612
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:12,010
interesting problem to dig into again

1613
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:14,139
thanks a lot yep Thank You<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steven</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">alright well thanks everybody for</font>

1615
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:18,309

1616
01:11:16,929 --> 01:11:20,079
hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> more work on the</font>

1617
01:11:18,309 --> 01:11:22,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementation and the mechanism side</font>

1618
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:24,759
and as well as the min set doc and

1619
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,710
thanks off and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

1620
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:37,570
longer slot<font color="#CCCCCC"> too thanks everybody for</font>
