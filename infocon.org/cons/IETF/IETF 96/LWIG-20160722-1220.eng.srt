1
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:29,580
so anyone cares for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java or anybody on</font>

2
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the jabber</font>

3
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:17,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so our plan to start so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

4
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:23,420
week working group make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

5
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right room so because it's Friday so</font>

6
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:32,329
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep into time okay my people</font>

7
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:39,170
is waiting and our responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATSDR</font>

8
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:42,379
probably on the way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately my</font>

9
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:46,040
culture robot could not make<font color="#E5E5E5"> to burning</font>

10
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:53,060
his time this is not well you probably

11
00:02:46,040 --> 00:03:01,069
have reduced the hundreds times and any

12
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:03,590
warranties to take minutes okay anyone

13
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:06,159
tears for to see if there's any people

14
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,159
on the chapel

15
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Matthews matthias could you help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

16
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:29,079
the chapel<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you on it I or anybody on</font>

17
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:32,940
the javelin sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you thank</font>

18
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:36,970
you what's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> name by the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

19
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:40,900
very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually have a warrant here</font>

20
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:44,170
for their minis taker we sound away but

21
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:52,840
sing for the general part is ok for his

22
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:54,910
absence Carrie<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh yeah we had we hand</font>

23
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:02,860
out the the blue sheet he's on the way

24
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:12,160
please sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay our responsibility is</font>

25
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:14,739
coming great so this is status of the

26
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:19,858
walking group document we have right now

27
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the desk so recently published the</font>

28
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:27,219
iCub to minimum nation guidance which is

29
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:30,190
obviously 7815 and also we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> L</font>

30
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:38,620
week co-op over senator document which

31
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:42,240
is in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Absinthe you and we have not</font>

32
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:45,370
document related to co-op in<font color="#CCCCCC"> plantation</font>

33
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,150
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> half has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been discussed many times</font>

34
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,510
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> years but now the state has has</font>

35
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:55,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">been inspired</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked with materials</font>

36
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:58,479
yesterday and he said he some plan about

37
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,800
some update of this document recently

38
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,440
and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a document about energy</font>

39
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,960
efficient invitation guidance which he

40
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,690
has has<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone through the walking group</font>

41
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,780
last core but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a silence during</font>

42
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call so I cannot say that they</font>

43
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,710
are saying consensus about this document

44
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,880
right now so we are still waiting for

45
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">more views and probably we can click OH</font>

46
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,460
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other walking the blast call for</font>

47
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:28,580
this document if we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> laid it and</font>

48
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:32,659
we can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sufficient view of this</font>

49
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:35,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">document here in the process and we have</font>

50
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,900
another good document about the POS

51
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,940
implementation and we can speak spout

52
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,039
waiting for the authors to if they have

53
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,790
interest or they still sink this useful

54
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:52,640
to continue so that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much on my</font>

55
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:55,400
side and so we have four for talks today

56
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,750
lister hill and also in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> agenda so</font>

57
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,489
because it's friday i really hope every

58
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,500
presenters to be on time precisely

59
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:08,120
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise people we are playing</font>

60
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:27,680
me so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of on to the next</font>

61
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:29,780
the first presentation callous<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok hello</font>

62
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,840
my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is carlos gomez and i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

63
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:35,330
present this initial version of the

64
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,570
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and title tcp of a constraint node</font>

65
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,520
networks and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> UPC and I took at and</font>

66
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:44,270
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> coiffeur is don't cook off from the</font>

67
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,580
University of Cambridge so first of all

68
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,909
let's take a look at the motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

69
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,789
this draft at this moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

70
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,880
situation where several application

71
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:59,000
layer protocols are being used for the

72
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,340
Internet of Things for instance we have

73
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the coop the constraint application</font>

74
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:07,400
protocol was originally designed / UDP

75
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,300
however there is currently a co-op over

76
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP specification being developed and</font>

77
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:18,680
then actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main reason for this</font>

78
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:22,130
copper over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP draft is the need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

79
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:26,090
overcome middle box problems then on the

80
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:29,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">other hand we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two and even</font>

81
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,690
HTTP one that one which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also being</font>

82
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,560
used or considered for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT and other</font>

83
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,860
application

84
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,190
layer protocols such as MQTT are also

85
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:44,540
being are also in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact deployed in the</font>

86
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:48,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">IOT and all of these are using TCP as</font>

87
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:51,260
the transport layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol so TCP is</font>

88
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,570
being aureus or will be used in many IOT

89
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,360
scenarios however it has not received

90
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:00,820
much attention yet and in fact it has

91
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,820
been sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> criticised</font>

92
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,139
so the main goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

93
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,870
offer simple measures to allow for

94
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:12,200
lightweight TCP implementation and

95
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:17,750
suitable operation for constrain node

96
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:20,659
networks well this work actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

97
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,590
related with more than one working group

98
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:26,139
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance this is related</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with core</font>

99
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,979
which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

100
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:32,990
specifies co-op and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> related</font>

102
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:39,620
DCP maintenance and minor extensions and

103
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">also this working group which has been</font>

104
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually suggested as the home for this</font>

105
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,930
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand that at some point</font>

106
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:53,960
we'll have some discussion or

107
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:57,620
confirmation<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this so on the actual</font>

108
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">content of the draft first of all we</font>

109
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,339
should take<font color="#CCCCCC"> into account each other</font>

110
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,500
typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> characteristics of constraint</font>

111
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,560
node networks which is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

112
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:11,020
well known<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this working group and</font>

113
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:14,140
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's defined in RFC 7228 so</font>

114
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,730
constrained nodes are devices which

115
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,790
typically exhibit significant

116
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:23,540
limitations on processing and memory

117
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:26,000
which limits the complexity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

118
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,599
implementation footprint of the

119
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,240
protocols being used then there may be

120
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,600
also significant limitations on energy

121
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,150
resources which means that the messages

122
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,790
involved in communication and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the size</font>

123
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,410
of those messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be reduced as</font>

124
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,500
much as possible

125
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:50,000
then these devices typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> use low</font>

126
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:52,610
ceilings which means links with high bit

127
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,490
error rate that's mostly because

128
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,870
typically wireless technologies are used

129
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:02,420
but also sometimes there are other wired

130
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:05,389
technology is quite common<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some IOT</font>

131
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,000
scenarios which however are also harsh

132
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:11,360
and offer some high bit error rate such

133
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,519
as power line communications with regard

134
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,850
to the network topology in some

135
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:21,019
scenarios we may have star networks so

136
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:23,689
that this ends up with being a single

137
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:25,639
hop communication scenario between a

138
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:28,459
constrained device on and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rooter for</font>

139
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:35,509
instance and in some other cases there's

140
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:37,008
a mesh or<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop deployment so let's</font>

141
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:41,329
take a look at the several

142
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:43,519
recommendations about how to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP in</font>

143
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:47,120
these environments as per the current

144
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:51,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of the draft so about the</font>

145
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:56,029
maximum segment size we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that ipv6</font>

146
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:58,939
requires support for 280 byte packets

<font color="#CCCCCC">seems like okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's better to</font>

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,149
maybe recommend or explain which are the

188
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,079
matter is how we can enable the stop and

<font color="#E5E5E5">currently in the draft is that we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually recommend the use of the same</font>

196
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,359
that's because we have experimentally

this new algorithm which is called Coco

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:55,029
and we have compared it with other

200
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:58,390
algorithms such as the one in RFC 62 98

201
00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:01,870
and many others and we believe that it

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,939
performs very well in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">environments so this is why we are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually recommending its use</font>

205
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:14,800
some of the features of this mechanism

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:18,069
include her in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font>

based actually on<font color="#E5E5E5"> RC 62 98 it also</font>

208
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:23,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">includes using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with our titties a</font>

mechanism and deterring so this has

211
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,430
shown to lead to good performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:40,120

214

215

<font color="#E5E5E5">state that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP connection should be</font>

218
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:56,290
actually there's some indication in a

00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,670
quantified terms which is that if data

<font color="#CCCCCC">two hours then the connection should be</font>

then the other hand we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

keep-alive messages lady use may be

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keepalive timer cannot be set to a</font>

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually some issues such as it doesn't</font>

234
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,620
guarantee avoiding middle box problems

235
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,620
because sometimes the bindings and the

236
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:51,760
state kept the middle boxes is released

237
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:55,060
earlier than two hours so the

238
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,790
alternatives might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe we have</font>

239
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,219
to anyway establish TCP connections

240
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,389
frequently or maybe application layer

241
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,529
heartbeat messages can be used also

242
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:07,779
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feedback that we have</font>

consideration is TCP<font color="#E5E5E5"> first open this</font>

245
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:19,480
would have the benefit of embedding data

246
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:21,020
already in the syn packets when a new

247
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,430
connection is established

248
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:28,460
however we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make some detailed</font>

249
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:31,609
analysis here because this week a fast

250
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:35,120
open involves negotiating a cookie which

251
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:37,550
has to be updated relatively frequently

252
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,110
and then also the cookie has to be

253
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:42,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">included in the same packet which also</font>

254
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:50,290
increases message size so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really need</font>

some detailed analysis here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then</font>

256
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:56,900
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mechanism of explicit</font>

00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,550
understand that may be used in

00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:22,069
the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACN can be useful to trigger</font>

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:25,310
congestion control mechanisms earlier

266
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:28,280
than maybe after the expression<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

267
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,960
RTO or earlier than waiting until the

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:40,610
having a single segment window it's

271
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:46,730
still useful to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trigger congestion</font>

the original stopping weight approach

274
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,830
that was enforced or is currently still

275
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,860
enforced by the draft it is that then

there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> several options which would</font>

the draft based on the feedback we have

phrase in a different way the

these options<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be relevant such as</font>

292
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,039
for instance selective<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledgement</font>

293
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:55,529
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> are with regard to explicit loss</font>

294
00:18:53,159 --> 00:19:00,210
notifications this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something which</font>

295
00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:02,429
could be useful to distinguish whether

296
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,610
loss is due to congestion in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

297
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:06,929
or whether it is due to<font color="#E5E5E5"> corruption this</font>

298
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,580
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful here because we are</font>

299
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:11,610
dealing with low ceilings in<font color="#E5E5E5"> constraint</font>

300
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:15,119
node networks however this remains

301
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:18,240
mostly as experimental work it hasn't

302
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:23,209
actually been widely deployed and hasn't

303
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">been really standardized maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 f so</font>

304
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:28,649
there are several other<font color="#E5E5E5"> items we should</font>

305
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:31,408
take into consideration for future

306
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:33,178
revisions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft one thing is to</font>

307
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:36,210
clarify the scenarios we are considering

308
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:39,509
for instance a major scenario coming

309
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:42,899
actually from one of the main motivation

310
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:46,259
items for the draft is to explain that

311
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:48,299
we have sometimes a constraint device

312
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,429
which may want to communicate with some

313
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,259
unconstrained device on the internet so

314
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:55,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need to detail which other</font>

315
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:58,350
implications of this scenario then

316
00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:00,330
something which has been suggested<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font>

317
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:04,559
consider delayed acknowledgments which

318
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:07,759
is the role<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this mechanism in this</font>

319
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,320
kind of scenarios we need to analyze

320
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:14,220
whether we can benefit from this

321
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,200
mechanism in which way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

322
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially in the context of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L week</font>

323
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,220
working group this document we

324
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,720
understand that it should collect

325
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:28,289
experience from<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation and</font>

deployment of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP in constrained node</font>

327
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:35,340
networks it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great to know if</font>

328
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:38,220
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had experience if something</font>

331
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,730
not and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

332
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,760
collect this

333
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:52,710
of valuable information in this document

334
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:56,190
and also there is this overall common

335
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,750
about the approach of the document by

336
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,200
which probably we should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

337
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:05,720
flexible<font color="#CCCCCC"> and even possibly removing</font>

338
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:13,080
maybe part or maybe even all of the RSC

339
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">2119 language so also we'd like to thank</font>

340
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,820
a lot everyone for the great feedback we

341
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,190
have received<font color="#CCCCCC"> from people in this</font>

342
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,990
working group also in the core working

343
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:27,360
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also in TCP and so thanks a</font>

344
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:30,210
lot everyone yes thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys has cast</font>

345
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,540
Bolin um that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I think it's really</font>

346
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">good thing to have a document like this</font>

347
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:39,659
so I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good that this work has</font>

348
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:42,780
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> started I think that the document</font>

349
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,700
could be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more explicit with</font>

350
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:48,240
respect to the situation that we often

351
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a very asymmetric situation yet I</font>

352
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,750
mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the links that are</font>

353
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,320
asymmetric it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementations that</font>

354
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:59,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the twins are asymmetric so one question</font>

355
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,629
for instance that comes up is is there

356
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,389
anything that a less constrained

357
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:09,450
implementation can do to help the

358
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:14,090
constraint implementation other example

359
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:18,510
on the MSS side the the constraint side

360
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:21,149
may know more about its fragmentation

361
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:24,510
properties and may for instance set the

362
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:28,130
NSS 250 and would be interesting to see

363
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:31,830
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens in particular I'm in ipv6</font>

364
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:36,090
um one DJ<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be at the start of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

365
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:38,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides we often forget that there is</font>

366
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:42,928
another IOT particle that is being used

367
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:46,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">on TCP which is xmpp yeah so we</font>

368
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:48,600
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be forgetting that room um I</font>

369
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:52,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's all that in German okay so</font>

370
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:55,530
I realize a cut line so and also make

371
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:59,050
your comment short<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alabama</font>

372
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:02,330
inria aqueous customer I think it's very

373
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,860
interesting and required to work and i

374
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,320
was wondering like a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

375
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,790
there was a draft about TCP header

376
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,040
compression i think it was into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

377
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:13,340
6lowpan group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was wondering if you</font>

378
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,170
have considered like you look at this

379
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,110
old draft or if you've considered some

380
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:21,890
other mechanism for header compression

381
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:24,860
well it is that if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp had a</font>

382
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:27,530
compression document was let's see in

383
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,679
progress or alive probably this document

384
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:32,920
would report that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

385
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,980
approach should be different<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know that</font>

386
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,870
there's this draft relatively yeah which

387
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,700
has been inactive for a while and i know

388
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,669
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are people who are interested</font>

389
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">in maybe reviving this kind of work so</font>

390
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,880
then I don't know which should be

391
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:50,090
exactly the relationship between this

392
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,190
document on that document but yeah I

393
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:56,689
agree that<font color="#E5E5E5"> having TCP header compression</font>

394
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:59,270
would be absolutely beneficial and just

395
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,450
one small comment I don't know if you're

396
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:04,970
aware but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ongoing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on a TCP</font>

397
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,550
implementation in right so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

398
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:10,580
main author of discipline patience the

399
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:13,669
room so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be thank you</font>

400
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,919
for you kill babies yeah that would be

401
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,050
great and if you have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

402
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:23,320
feedback or who may just discuss this

403
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:23,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of stuff will be helpful things</font>

404
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:30,919
Carolyn<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great work too</font>

405
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:34,550
um I had comment a question first my

406
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,650
understanding of RFC 2460 and this

407
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,510
remains in the best version is that

408
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,400
nodes this is not something we've talked

409
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:44,210
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot but it says that nodes have</font>

410
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,390
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assemble an MTU of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1500</font>

411
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,680
octets after fragmentation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

412
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,800
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point out that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there may be</font>

413
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:54,140
some constrained implementations that

414
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,379
actually support an empty of that size

415
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,200
so please don't limit yourself to 1280

416
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,100
you know keep that 1500 number in mind

417
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,170
my question was going to be about

418
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,080
running code I just heard the gentleman

419
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,730
from riot speak I would mention that

420
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,020
there's already TCP implementation in

421
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">kontiki I don't know if it could be</font>

422
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,200
lightened up you know using<font color="#CCCCCC"> this you</font>

423
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,299
know using<font color="#CCCCCC"> your technique</font>

424
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,590
but you'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting to take</font>

425
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:20,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">a look at that ya think hi my name is</font>

426
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,730

428
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,169
that is an interesting document probably

429
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,899
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group to</font>

00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:40,059

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">change anything with beyond what the TCP</font>

436
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:52,279
specifications low then I think this has

437
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:56,840
to be home in TC p.m. we are open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

438
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:58,760
such work but I think you should stay

439
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,590
within the limits of the TCP

440
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,960
specification which gives you a lot of

441
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,399
opportunities but you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> please stay</font>

442
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,340
within the limits and if you change the

443
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol please come to TC p.m. yes</font>

444
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:13,220
absolutely so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't agree more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

445
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:17,360
suresh krisshnan Eddie had so I'm

446
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:19,639
skipping the mic cutting so so like

447
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,779
specifically like slide 12 like doesn't

448
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:23,809
belong here so there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

449
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:27,260
need to do and as logistics right stuff

450
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:28,940
and slide 12 but for example right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

451
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,730
so it doesn't belong here so it needs to

452
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">go but as logistics point so if the</font>

453
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,460
working group decides about this

454
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,889
document and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font>

455
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:40,100
shepherd from like transport somewhere

456
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:41,600
so media here they promised to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get us a</font>

457
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,389
stripper<font color="#E5E5E5"> from transport to get this true</font>

458
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,918
so it gets the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> review and one</font>

459
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:49,158
more thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

460
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,830
like do frequent sing cups of tea CPM so

461
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:55,250
probably like every other meeting cycle

462
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:57,408
or something like go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tease p.m.</font>

463
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,630
show what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stakes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if there's</font>

464
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:01,399
anything open just keep the stuff sing

465
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:07,820
so we don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a late surprise in the</font>

466
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:17,029
iesg at the end nice car look no way

467
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:21,519
tonight tiny sauce thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>

468
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:21,519
yeah we can discuss on minis yeah

469
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,550
next one will heat

470
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:55,169
thanks n so I have a lot of slides I

471
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,879
will try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through them quickly this</font>

472
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:58,739
was our trough documenting our

473
00:27:56,879 --> 00:28:02,849
experiences with public key cryptography

474
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:05,219
on small devices so by small devices i

475
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:07,678
mean really small devices devices that

476
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:10,889
have 8-bit microprocessor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and three to</font>

477
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,849
five kilobytes of RAM we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

478
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:16,619
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see three things first what</font>

479
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:18,658
kind of libraries are available for me

480
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:21,149
as a developer so what kind of trip to

481
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,190
libraries<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can use second thing that we</font>

482
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:25,018
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see was how hard was was it to</font>

483
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually use this library so what is it</font>

484
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:29,789
the days of a day of<font color="#CCCCCC"> work or or it</font>

485
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:31,529
required more hacking and and the third

486
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:33,299
thing was what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of performance we</font>

487
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:36,089
can get with these libraries that that

488
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:38,879
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist so for all my measurements</font>

489
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:44,639
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this Arduino mega bored which has</font>

490
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:47,668
a 8-bit microprocessor so the first the

491
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:51,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did was use RSA and</font>

492
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:53,429
no surprises there for a reasonable key

493
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:55,589
length the performance was pretty

494
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:59,129
undesirable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was it was very slow</font>

495
00:28:55,589 --> 00:29:01,440
so if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key size of 20 48</font>

496
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:04,379
bits which is what you would assume or

497
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,899
probably even bigger the execution time

498
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:08,189
for for modular exponentiation and

499
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:13,228
signing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the private key was</font>

500
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:15,629
actually pretty slope so then then we

501
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:17,429
looked at libraries that support

502
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:20,009
elliptic curve digital signature

503
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:21,509
algorithm bear with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for a couple of</font>

504
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:23,849
slides and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll explain why we were</font>

505
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:27,389
focusing on ecdsa<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not some of the</font>

506
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:30,089
other other algorithms we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

507
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:32,549
libraries that that support ecdsa<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

508
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:36,509
small devices so relic my Chronicle

509
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:39,509
wisely when tiny CC there's also matrix

510
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:41,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">SSL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and polar SSL but there are more</font>

511
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:45,239
focused for 32-bit devices and we wanted

512
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:47,458
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run our code on 8-bit devices so so</font>

513
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:51,070
we didn't get any numbers from from

514
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:53,679
those libraries<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah this is a</font>

515
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:56,350
off to give you overview of some of the

516
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,909
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we measured I don't know if</font>

517
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,129
all of you can read back there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

518
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:02,860
important takeaway is that in less than

519
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:05,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 kilobytes of RAM you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do</font>

520
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:08,289
signing operation in less than a second

521
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:10,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">and for one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is Sir</font>

522
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:12,669
curve you could actually do ecdsa

523
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:17,919
signing in in less<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 300 milliseconds</font>

524
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:19,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually 261 milliseconds at</font>

525
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,000
the library<font color="#CCCCCC"> had actually implemented</font>

526
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,490
some some mathematical optimizations

527
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,100
directly in assembly so this goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

528
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,659
show that if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a persistent</font>

529
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:33,039
enough you can get the numbers really

530
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:34,960
down some of the cookers there were

531
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,000
there on the previous slide are probably

532
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,389
not recommended anymore so something

533
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,480
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> P 256 or crypto forum is now</font>

534
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:45,399
specifying the<font color="#CCCCCC"> edwards cup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 255 19</font>

535
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,980
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be probably</font>

536
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:53,018
more more sensible to you to use on this

537
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:55,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">all devices we found some numbers for</font>

538
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:58,240
the same Arduino mega bored for signing

539
00:30:55,389 --> 00:31:00,699
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1.4 seconds and for verification</font>

540
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,830
it was two seconds which may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font>

541
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,159
ideal in all scenarios but bear in mind

542
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:07,960
this was on a 8-bit processor so we had

543
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,779
the discussion in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACE working group</font>

544
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,669
about the lighting use case and it might

545
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:14,529
make sense to just use a 32-bit

546
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:16,450
processor because it's cheaper to

547
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:18,549
actually get them and in the lighting

548
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:21,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">use case you you don't actually have the</font>

549
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:23,230
problem of energy harvesting or low

550
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:29,110
power supply you have all the power you

551
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:31,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">need so now I come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the slide why we</font>

552
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:34,209
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure ecdsa in particular</font>

553
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:36,759
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we can</font>

554
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:39,190
develop a full-fledged application where

555
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,679
a sensor device is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a co-op server</font>

556
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:45,070
but a co-op client and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

557
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,200
sends signed updates to a proxy and this

558
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:51,700
proxy would then serve data on on behalf

559
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,769
of the sensor so the proxy registers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

560
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,570
resource to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> resource directory and</font>

561
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:58,690
the client any client that is interested

562
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:01,029
in the date data does a look-up on

563
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-known core gets the location of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

564
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:05,080
proxy and then then gets the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed</font>

565
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,090
updates from the

566
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:11,080
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you do end-to-end data</font>

567
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:12,730
authentication from from the sensor to

568
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client even though there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:22,060
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of object security is kind of</font>

572
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,750
very helpful when you have

00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:30,070
intermediaries<font color="#CCCCCC"> in between so we</font>

574
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:32,650
implemented the co-op client and all the

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:41,100
keys we implemented the proxy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

578
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,870
resource directory on x86 machine and

579
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:48,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just show the important numbers is</font>

580
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:51,459
like it was possible to do all of this

581
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:53,740
including sorry the network layer UDP

582
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,660
everything in less than five thousand

583
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,790
bytes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM so this goes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show that</font>

584
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,360
if you really put some<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort into it</font>

585
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:07,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get the numbers actually quite</font>

586
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:10,300
quite minimal implementation so what we

587
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:12,340
learned from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is of course our</font>

588
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,980
platform was unnecessarily restrictive

589
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:17,770
so normally you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would choose something</font>

590
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,050
like a 32-bit ARM processor or something

591
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">more powerful but our point was that if</font>

592
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do on such a small device of</font>

593
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:29,530
course you can do it on 16-bit and

594
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:31,840
32-bit processors faster and as is now

595
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:33,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known it actually costs you more to</font>

596
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,860
turn on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> radio and send and receive</font>

597
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,990
messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> than it costs you to do the</font>

598
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,580
crypto so it would make sense to choose

599
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:43,030
the right platform that can do the

600
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:44,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Crippler that is needed yeah there's no</font>

601
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:48,010
good reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose platforms that</font>

602
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:51,580
don't provide sufficient computing so

603
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:53,710
this was the implementation part so what

604
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,899
we implemented the whole application the

605
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,720
client and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we have</font>

606
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:02,020
the guidance part or so to say we

607
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,730
discuss some of the trade-offs and in

608
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,800
the in the draft we currently have

609
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,840
discussion about symmetric key<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs</font>

610
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">asymmetric key and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

611
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">people have this belief that symmetric</font>

612
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:14,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">key crypto doesn't scale which is</font>

613
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:16,239
somehow a misconception because cellular

614
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,190
network authentication which is one of

615
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">the largest deployed cryptographic</font>

616
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,590
security

617
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,870
deployments actually does use symmetric

618
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,669
keys however we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that scale</font>

619
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:27,560
should be the important deciding factor

620
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:32,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's actually what you want to do in</font>

621
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:34,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">your application so if it's it might</font>

622
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,350
make sense to do this asymmetric crypto

623
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:38,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">prescience at the beginning to do the</font>

624
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:40,759
key exchange then derive a symmetric key

625
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,429
and use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that however if there are</font>

626
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,770
proxies and intermediaries or the

627
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,600
connection is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very shortly so think of</font>

628
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,489
if you are using a phone to open a<font color="#CCCCCC"> door</font>

629
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:53,830
lock you might actually want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

630
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:57,620
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> object security so</font>

631
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:59,870
we have some discussion on trade-offs of

632
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:03,140
doing security at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different layers</font>

633
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:05,660
of course link layer is good and useful

634
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,270
but it can be problematic because it's

635
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,339
it only protects the first hop and many

636
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:14,390
of them use group keys so if if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key</font>

637
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:18,110
gets compromised you can have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorts</font>

638
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:20,390
of problems then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have IP 2nd Para the</font>

639
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:23,600
network layer and our favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS and</font>

640
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:25,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">dtls at the at the transport layer and</font>

641
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,580
they see they work fine as long as you

642
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,140
don't have middleboxes in between but if

643
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,120
you do have middleboxes in between

644
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application that we</font>

645
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,650
did where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sign and send objects to a</font>

646
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,630
proxy in between and and that ensures

647
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:43,430
end-to-end data authentication might be

648
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:45,470
actually useful and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you do</font>

649
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,330
this you need erection communication

650
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:50,089
where the sensor only wakes up once in a

651
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:51,830
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sends signed updates you need</font>

652
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:54,250
to ensure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that there is freshness</font>

653
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:57,350
so you need some some way of protecting

654
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,870
replay attacks and we have some

655
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">guidelines on how you can do that so of</font>

656
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:04,190
course there is sequence numbers and

657
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:05,840
time stamps and if you have too long to

658
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,880
short sequence numbers they can wrap

659
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,100
around if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> too long sequence</font>

660
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,560
numbers your packet size grows and how

661
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:15,799
you can get around that and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> then if</font>

662
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,630
if some entities get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sync how you</font>

663
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,630
can recover from that so we have some

664
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:24,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">text on on on basically how to ensure</font>

665
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:26,390
freshness yeah so I went through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

666
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,550
quickly because I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

667
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:31,250
ask the group I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the authors</font>

668
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:35,800
believe it's it's fairly stable

669
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:38,150
document it serves as a good data point

670
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:42,860
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already using it and</font>

671
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:44,450
referencing it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have the up sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

672
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,340
you have a question please finish in

673
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:48,919
them yeah please<font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead ask the</font>

674
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:52,220
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sorry juan carlos work</font>

675
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">slow i haven't read that the draft so i</font>

676
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:58,100
apologize no probably Thursday the the

677
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,810
it's very very useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> information what</font>

678
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have here what what kind of rate</font>

679
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,810
interface were you using when you say

680
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:05,479
that you were comparing our processing

681
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,920
power<font color="#CCCCCC"> and power consumption so for the</font>

682
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,390
crypto stuff we were actually not

683
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,520
sending anything but for the real

684
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:12,529
application we use ethernet it was

685
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,600
purely Jesus alternate on the yeah yeah

686
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:18,110
internet on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids are no radio or</font>

687
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:24,860
over the earth day was yeah wired ya

688
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:26,570
thank ya so if it's okay with the chair

689
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would like to take a quick show of</font>

690
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:37,730
hands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have actually</font>

691
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:40,970
read the draft your own dime a dozen

692
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:47,390
yeah yeah a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> so then minute</font>

693
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:52,580
takers please Frank Towson so let's take

694
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:55,330
click PO so seems that a big audience

695
00:37:52,580 --> 00:38:00,140
has to read these droughts it's pretty

696
00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:02,779
positive and I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask i just</font>

697
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,240
want to mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm game ah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tango</font>

698
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:10,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Indra and yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working on my thesis</font>

699
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:12,680
would say the security of constraint

700
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,790
devices and i found the reference is

701
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,919
what you have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> used in the</font>

702
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">statistics as partisan so daft and the</font>

703
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,960
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite useful for my thesis</font>

704
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:27,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so yeah i'll require ask so</font>

705
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,740
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have think that is</font>

706
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:37,220
documenting useful and could be adopted

707
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:41,839
as a walking document<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

708
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:43,250
doesn't close to 20 yeah so how many

709
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:48,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that</font>

710
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:52,370
we cannot adopt this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> no okay</font>

711
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:54,020
cool yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah anyway we have</font>

712
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:57,290
come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the menu needs to confirm</font>

713
00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this consciences okay good great thanks</font>

714
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:04,779
thank you so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one is Tobias</font>

715
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,680
hello my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is Tobias I'm here because</font>

716
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:28,730
Danielle can't be here and I'm working

717
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">with them on the minimal EST trust the</font>

718
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:36,320
motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us on working on ipsec or</font>

719
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,770
ESP is basically something like that if

720
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,940
you consider a lot of devices in a

721
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:44,300
infrastructure something like a house or

722
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:47,090
a university<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whatever the current</font>

723
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,790
status<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you secure your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> device with</font>

724
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:53,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">TTLs against a cloud and if you now add</font>

725
00:39:49,790 --> 00:40:00,650
like health centers you do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

726
00:39:53,530 --> 00:40:03,290
sorry Stefan tree yeah yeah so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

727
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:05,030
a few problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are a few</font>

728
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,070
privacy issues because you always send

729
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:09,200
the IP address of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> device you're</font>

730
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:11,030
actually using so someone could track

731
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,700
you even could track your health sensor

732
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:17,060
and therefore could derive diseases or

733
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,580
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> just because of addresses and</font>

734
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:21,920
it's also difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage like if</font>

735
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:25,360
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the owner of such a domain it's</font>

736
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,130
very difficult to manage and to update

737
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:31,880
so what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are considering is using</font>

738
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">IPSec to or ESP to step with something</font>

739
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:37,690
what we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> to main security so that</font>

740
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:40,430
you secure device devices against the

741
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:43,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gateway and this gateway is secured is</font>

742
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:48,100
ipsec are against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud or any other</font>

743
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:50,870
VPN connection that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easier to</font>

744
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:54,290
provide privacy because you don't

745
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:56,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually send the addresses anymore</font>

746
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:58,099
through the internet

747
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,200
and also easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage to the</font>

748
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:08,540
magnitude the owner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a domain you can</font>

749
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:11,118
<font color="#CCCCCC">easily like update the security so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

750
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:15,140
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ESP or ipsec ESP</font>

751
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:18,950
complements the toolbox of IOT towards

752
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:21,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">dtls enticed it has some significant</font>

753
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:24,348
features to security IT first you can

754
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:27,109
provide the main security what i just

755
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:31,160
showed and it's also capable of to make

756
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:35,240
a multicast security you can secure any

757
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:37,190
transport layer you want and it avoids

758
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,990
like privacy issues but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just said</font>

759
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:44,300
like if you or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific application</font>

760
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:48,319
apart it's also very flexible because

761
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,510
you're in the back not like<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls you're</font>

762
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,810
independent of an key exchange you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

763
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:55,609
use any key exchange protocol you on the

764
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:58,640
obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ike and we already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

765
00:41:55,609 --> 00:42:00,859
minimal<font color="#E5E5E5"> iq2 as an RC of this working</font>

766
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,109
group but you can also use<font color="#E5E5E5"> with like</font>

767
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:05,900
radio key exchange protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> slagged x</font>

768
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:09,319
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very common in IOT devices in</font>

769
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:12,080
the moment there is a RFC for multicast

770
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,940
key exchange and you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with any</font>

771
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:18,170
other of you can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up it manually</font>

772
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:21,680
to establish the keys the goal of

773
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,900
minimal ESP is to provide guidelines for

774
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,830
an implementer to remain fully I could

775
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:30,080
be comfortable to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC how to build</font>

776
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:33,650
the truck how to build the ESP fields

777
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:36,348
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of computation and also</font>

778
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:39,320
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> ciphers should be implemented this</font>

779
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:42,380
is already part of a working document in

780
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:45,859
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d which points out some</font>

781
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:47,810
IOT specific ciphers so in the next

782
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:53,000
version of minimal ESP we would probably

783
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:55,700
at over now a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference to this RFC once</font>

784
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,830
it comes out how to read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the basic</font>

785
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:02,210
idea is how to implement ESP with

786
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:05,420
guidelines for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> app developer just to</font>

787
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:08,500
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the basic idea that's the ESP</font>

788
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,800
packet you have the sequence number to

789
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,320
identify

790
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,440
the security Association on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint</font>

791
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,750
so on the point which receives two

792
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,660
encrypted packet if a sequence number

793
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:24,020
and in your payload which is headed to

794
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP alignment with the pad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lengths</font>

795
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,370
and the next terror which points to the

796
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:32,000
for example UDP packet in the payload

797
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:34,670
and then we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an integrity check so</font>

798
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,490
what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say in minimal ESP how</font>

799
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,530
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> this fields as a developer for</font>

800
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:42,770
example for<font color="#E5E5E5"> SBI you could use IP</font>

801
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:48,170
addresses for the sequence number you

802
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:50,480
can accept and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know instead of</font>

803
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">using a counter you can for example use</font>

804
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,140
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the only requirement is</font>

805
00:43:52,760 --> 00:44:00,040
that it's increasing all the time to

806
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:08,060
avoid padding we have some

807
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:10,880
recommendations on that and yeah so now

808
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:16,430
our belief ipsec ESP is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable</font>

809
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:20,740
valuable option for IOT<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 low working</font>

810
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:24,759
group on Monday agreed that is PS a--

811
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:28,970
it's good to have in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT toolbox</font>

812
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:31,880
ipsec working group just broke down the

813
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:34,129
field raft for example implicit<font color="#CCCCCC"> i leave</font>

814
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,780
was just adopted as the IP second to

815
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,400
develop you second me working group that

816
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,970
you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send an implicit IV</font>

817
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:45,830
for counter ciphers and like the one I

818
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:49,549
mentioned decipher supports yeah for

819
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:53,330
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT requirements and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

820
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:55,760
have minimal<font color="#E5E5E5"> iq2 so we think that we</font>

821
00:44:53,330 --> 00:45:03,200
should have an ESP minimal ESP also in

822
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:05,150
the working group thank you so there's

823
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,460
Krishnan so have you gotten any comments

824
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:09,650
on this current draft from any security

825
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:14,180
people like specifically ipsec new

826
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:16,010
people yes for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> taro is involved</font>

827
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:20,120
and like the chair of<font color="#CCCCCC"> five second years</font>

828
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:22,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">involves int espero con ESP okay Brian</font>

829
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:25,150
are you gonna volunteer to review<font color="#CCCCCC"> he'll</font>

830
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:25,150
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

831
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:31,350
yes I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut a line right now yeah</font>

832
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brian wise i did just briefly look at it</font>

833
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:34,680
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do overview it looks like you</font>

834
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,490
haven't actually cut any bites out it

835
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:40,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">may seem minimal it's really about the</font>

836
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:42,118
methods of getting filling the various

837
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,830
values you're making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier for the</font>

838
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,180
constraint device yes there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

839
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:47,430
compression involved that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

840
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:50,129
here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elba it's compression is another</font>

841
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:52,080
draft but that is just to implement to

842
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,770
give implementer a guideline on how to

843
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:58,259
implement IPC EST nice to compress it

844
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">diced why didn't mention is opposed like</font>

845
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,980
be too which really did like me to know

846
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,529
magraph did really<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

847
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,880
reduce some of payloads and such yes any

848
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,730
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to was actually the</font>

849
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,200
motivation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good so I'm</font>

850
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:12,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wooden group does about this like</font>

851
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,069
I'll figure out like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some</font>

852
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,660
more like Brian volunteer to do one I'll

853
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:18,780
also talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Securities to figure</font>

854
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,720
out how to get more review on this sure

855
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:24,240
Norris related to this is that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

856
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,459
see also have to travel related to the

857
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,100
ESP in the six<font color="#CCCCCC"> low walking group what's</font>

858
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:32,190
relationship is to document we stick

859
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:34,339
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weenie just prison here the</font>

860
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:37,770
once in six<font color="#E5E5E5"> low are going to compress</font>

861
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,720
ESP or the payload this one is just an

862
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:43,369
implementation implementation guide on

863
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:49,859
how to minimal implement ESP without

864
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:52,650
going out of the borders of ESP so well

865
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:55,830
exactly that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> name that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Danny amigo</font>

866
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:57,270
one of the co-author<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erickson so the</font>

867
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,190
main difference between the diet and

868
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,920
this one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with this</font>

869
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:04,140
implementation we allow a very small

870
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,580
implementation that is interoperable

871
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:12,618
with the existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so is</font>

872
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:16,440
there any open source support on this or

873
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:19,920
any code available online we implemented

874
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,930
it on configuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Kentucky</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

875
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,780
contribute that or me it was actually

876
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of started to develop on from</font>

877
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:33,510
someone in Sweden I think he and another

878
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:35,160
Kentucky I know I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ESP it's</font>

879
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,900
already implemented in Kentucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

880
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:42,589
that's open source

881
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:44,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great any more comments on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them so</font>

882
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:54,770
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to ask how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people had read</font>

883
00:47:44,569 --> 00:48:05,150
a draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> and some five six so uh so how</font>

884
00:47:54,770 --> 00:48:07,460
many is honestly yeah we can ask because

885
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:11,720
uh since that audience is<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you know</font>

886
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:14,359
who has redraw releasing<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask Connor is</font>

887
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,250
talking yeah the ad suggest we confirm

888
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:19,220
the contents on the list and hopefully

889
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:24,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can get some views from security</font>

890
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:24,339
people okay great<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you thank you</font>

891
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:35,420
okay we come to our last item on the

892
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:41,000
agenda which is from Causton so who in

893
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:53,059
this room knows what RFC 7228 s<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

894
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:59,210
good so the this has been out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for three</font>

895
00:48:53,059 --> 00:49:01,910
years on and the question came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up is it</font>

896
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:03,260
may be time for an update<font color="#CCCCCC"> after two</font>

897
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:06,170
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> this may be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

898
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:08,480
surprising but turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that the draft</font>

899
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:11,569
actually was the RFC actually was quite

900
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:14,420
useful and there are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

901
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:17,029
that could have happened whether the

902
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:19,400
word has moved since of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course so is</font>

903
00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:22,220
there may be something new that we want

904
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:25,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take account of like the other one is</font>

905
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:28,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we might simply find that there is</font>

906
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:30,920
terminology missing we've run into

907
00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:32,690
terminology every day that is not

908
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,339
clearly defined where we have different

909
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:37,299
words for the same thing or the same

910
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:42,440
word for different things so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

911
00:49:37,299 --> 00:49:44,089
an idea to update the raft<font color="#CCCCCC"> pizzette so</font>

912
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,940
even that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to take a</font>

913
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:49,460
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two to do this the next version</font>

914
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:55,460
what we maybe 2017

915
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:59,950
2018 so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that bad so let's talk</font>

916
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:05,330
about two areas of potential work one is

917
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:10,509
terminology for platforms so most people

918
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:15,319
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven to twenty 84 + 0 + 1 + 2 +</font>

919
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:19,099
and one thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed is that people</font>

920
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:21,290
have big trouble distinguishing big

921
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:23,210
computers from small computers big

922
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:24,920
computers are sometimes also very small

923
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:28,730
they're called<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast berry pies and so on</font>

924
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:32,030
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we probably need some terminology</font>

925
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:35,480
that distinguishes between the

926
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:38,480
microcontrollers that 7228 really is

927
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,839
about and the big computers the

928
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:45,050
computers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> run linux and which also</font>

929
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:48,109
may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty small in the end but they</font>

930
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:50,630
have quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> different characteristics so</font>

931
00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:53,779
in the software update workshop we seem

932
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:56,540
to pick up the antenna terminology on

933
00:50:53,780 --> 00:51:00,530
this so with an arm you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they have</font>

934
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:02,599
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> contexts a processors and their</font>

935
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:06,080
context n processors and we started

936
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:08,630
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a class in m-class devices</font>

937
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:11,359
and of course every tricky knows that we

938
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:14,599
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> living on an m-class planet so this</font>

939
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,730
is very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can now decide</font>

940
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:18,589
whether maybe according this to this

941
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:22,880
terminology the big processor should be

942
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:25,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">j-class processors but ok so this is one</font>

943
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,300
one point where we definitely need

944
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:32,060
additional feminine we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

945
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:35,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the two classes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the two useful</font>

946
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:39,529
classes last one in class we<font color="#CCCCCC"> identified</font>

947
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:43,580
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> artoo cause sometimes there's</font>

948
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:45,050
maybe a use for a class 3 or class 4 so

949
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,509
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance that would be useful to</font>

950
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:49,430
identify a class that actually is

951
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:52,550
powerful enough to run something like

952
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:54,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript by name you might want to</font>

953
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,750
introduce subclasses so this this might

954
00:51:54,950 --> 00:52:00,930
be another place where it might be used

955
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:04,500
for to do some graph then we have

956
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:06,930
discussed crypto capabilities so simple

957
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:09,480
things like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aes</font>

958
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:12,529
accelerator may be interesting odd we

959
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,150
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes instructions in this video</font>

960
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:18,329
I'm not quite clear what that could be

961
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:20,369
but maybe it's worth looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

962
00:52:18,329 --> 00:52:23,630
different platforms and trying to

963
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:26,359
classify them in the capabilities

964
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:29,369
finally we are seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more</font>

965
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:31,670
micro controller class platforms that

966
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:35,250
actually do have some protection

967
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:42,540
capabilities memory protection units

968
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:45,359
memory mapping units even some have city

969
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:49,349
you'll flags like cannabis users we have

970
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:52,770
trust zone or secure element elements we

971
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:56,130
have 10 / proof capabilities in very

972
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:59,250
many platforms because people just don't

973
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:01,800
don't want their source code truly their

974
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:04,890
limitation code to leak out and so on so

975
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:07,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe it's worth looking at those</font>

976
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:10,980
probabilities and defining classes for

977
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,170
that we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java code and now me you</font>

978
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,700
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> record do you want me to fight to</font>

979
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:19,079
you finish their presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

980
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:21,450
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay brain so we are also in ace</font>

981
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:25,740
having problems defining clock

982
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:28,470
capabilities of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices some don't</font>

983
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">have time awareness at all so fresh a</font>

984
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:33,089
token<font color="#E5E5E5"> validation cannot be done the way</font>

985
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:36,058
you do normal you out so you need

986
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:38,849
non-space methods some<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices have</font>

987
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:41,160
relative time capabilities and some

988
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:43,619
devices might be clogged or synchronized

989
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:47,250
so to express the problems we are facing

990
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:49,410
we also need maybe on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> document like</font>

991
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:51,960
this I a clear definition of the

992
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:53,700
capabilities of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> note that's a very</font>

993
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:58,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">good point actually ran into the same</font>

994
00:53:53,700 --> 00:54:02,399
problem already we could maybe talk

995
00:53:58,799 --> 00:54:04,470
about power constraints some more so we

996
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,180
have some basic general terminology in

997
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,549
there I'm not sure how successful that

998
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:11,368
terminology has been I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing it</font>

999
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:14,040
in everyday exchange but that may be

1000
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:18,860
just because people another way of it

1001
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:22,400
and maybe we also can look at these

1002
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:24,900
sustainable power and energy total

1003
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,540
parameters and maybe build something

1004
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:30,420
like classes so we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that there</font>

1005
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:33,480
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a watch class I OGE and a micro wat</font>

1006
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:40,410
class IOT and they are very different in

1007
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:42,060
many aspects finally we could look at

1008
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:45,120
terminal e front terminology from

1009
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:49,980
networks some more so I found out that

1010

<font color="#E5E5E5">we often have difficulty grasping the</font>

1011
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:55,890
different mpu properties of networks in

have network to it with ridiculous and

00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:07,080
classes of ridiculousness hear something

00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:09,450
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that also maybe the fact that these</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have sustainable bit rates in the</font>

1019
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:19,950
to some classes we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> new kinds of</font>

asymmetry<font color="#CCCCCC"> sewn in LP when we often have</font>

00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:26,189
very powerful base stations that talk to

1022
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,960
two very simple battery operated devices

1023
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,450
and this is a bit different from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

devices are of the same capability level

1026
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,540
and finally I think the mobility

1027
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,420
question that we managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore and</font>

in 60 for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years might also come come</font>

1029
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:48,720
in young in some form so as you can see

1030
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:53,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a number of areas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

1031
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:56,640
we could start defining things and I

1032
00:55:53,250 --> 00:56:02,100
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one volunteer fall for the</font>

1033
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:03,690
the clock or time-based issue where

<font color="#E5E5E5">which has already done some work at so I</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she is interested in this and</font>

1036
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,930
what I really would like to assemble is

1037
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:16,380
a group of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1038
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:23,029
contribute to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be pushing</font>

1039
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:26,130
out a draft blah blah blah 73 72 28 bits

1040
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:29,490
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will stop collecting</font>

1041
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:30,960
it is Carrie Lynn yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Karsten I agree</font>

1042
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:32,729
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your initial comment that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this has</font>

1043
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,099
been extremely useful because I remember

1044
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:36,869
in the early days<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discussions you</font>

1045
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:38,849
know people were thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that raspberry</font>

1046
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:41,059
pi was a constrained device and you know

1047
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:43,410
of course to us it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> super computer</font>

1048
00:56:41,059 --> 00:56:46,259
but just to follow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your point</font>

1049
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:48,058
about memory consumption an example of

1050
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:50,160
the world changing would be if somebody

1051
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:52,440
has perfected a small fuel cell you know

1052
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:55,348
the size of a watch battery and those

1053
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,089
things where's law is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to save</font>

1054
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:59,730
as here somebody has already made you

1055
00:56:57,089 --> 00:57:01,710
know the point in one of the earlier

1056
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:04,170
conversations that there's no reason not

1057
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:06,119
to pick a cpu that's capable of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1058
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:09,269
the work you need unless you're powered

1059
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:11,460
by battery so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i agree with you</font>

1060
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:13,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe the point is is that there's not</font>

1061
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough awareness of the power constraint</font>

1062
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,839
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i plug on electrical power not to</font>

1063
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:21,419
keep our be good if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next version</font>

1064
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:23,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">could take them yeah so do different</font>

1065
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:29,430
specific classes in line for a little

1066
00:57:23,549 --> 00:57:31,890
bit early yeah we had the Lions card

1067
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:35,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah please contain Christian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gross</font>

1068
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:37,379
cannot support the work on this also

1069
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:39,930
note there's already worker<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

1070
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:42,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">coop working group on the transport</font>

1071
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:44,910
negotiation they're proposing to extend

1072
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:50,130
this around transport availability so

1073
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:52,490
much no Chet into the draft this is

1074
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:56,190
Sunday mean overall for mighty low and

1075
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:59,729
agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about the problem we have</font>

1076
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:03,779
enough you want to describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new</font>

1077
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:07,170
constraint of these networks then I can

1078
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:09,359
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you describe these because we</font>

1079
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:12,390
have a new scale then we are sending

1080
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:16,890
packets per day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not per second right</font>

1081
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:20,129
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> millage in year when you're</font>

1082
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:23,400
bajillion ram<font color="#CCCCCC"> I fully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support this work</font>

1083
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:28,079
I think Marcy 7228 was already very

1084
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:31,410
useful and refrigerant could be uh well

1085
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,480
could extend this<font color="#E5E5E5"> usefulness however I</font>

1086
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:35,640
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we you know if we want this</font>

1087
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:38,039
talking to be really useful we there's a

1088
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,420
trade-off between you know describing

1089
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:43,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">like so many classes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1090
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:45,270
I things I mean obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> extreme cases</font>

1091
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,940
like one class per device right so we

1092
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:49,619
don't want to get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um I think</font>

1093
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,750
there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be two phases in the club</font>

1094
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:53,700
in this document really first like we

1095
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:56,940
kind of assessing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what has changed</font>

1096
00:58:53,700 --> 00:59:00,649
in and then you know try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce the</font>

1097
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:03,210
number of classes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum somehow</font>

1098
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:05,430
is it straight up yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> also one outcome</font>

1099
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:07,530
for instance might be if rent was doing

1100
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:10,710
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work we might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a second</font>

1101
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:12,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">drop that just discusses this like we</font>

1102
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:15,869
already have a draft for crypto or<font color="#CCCCCC"> N and</font>

1103
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:19,859
so on his old and very open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to removing</font>

1104
00:59:15,869 --> 00:59:24,210
things between get so yes 80 comments

1105
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:25,680
Cecil are no ID had so just just an

1106
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:28,980
industry description as an individual

1107
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,450
I'm just wondering right like if RFC is

1108
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,530
the right format for this right like

1109
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:34,950
since it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's like</font>

1110
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:38,339
evolving pretty quickly I would say

1111
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:39,779
right like so 7228 is like like if you

1112
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:41,700
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number its too young to be</font>

1113
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">obsoleted right and and I'm just</font>

1114
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,549
thinking like so this like a couple of

1115
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,809
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing this like one of them is</font>

1116
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:47,549
like probably like some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vicky</font>

1117
00:59:45,809 --> 00:59:50,160
somebody maintains another one is like

1118
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:51,540
probably keep it as a draft right like

1119
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,270
keep it as a working group graph for a

1120
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:56,520
bit and give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time maybe like a</font>

1121
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:58,380
year or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two like just hold</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1122
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,520
then do it like I i just want like the

1123
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:02,790
wasn't really think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well</font>

1124
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,460
yes so not my quick answer to this would

1125
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:08,009
be a terminology is most useful when we

1126
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:11,190
have consensus on it so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font>

1127
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:13,410
place where Ricky is not sufficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1128
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:15,869
two need some to build something senses

1129
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:17,368
but but keeping the draft active for

1130
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:20,549
some while and then collecting things

1131
01:00:17,369 --> 01:00:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're competing with yeah probably</font>

1132
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:27,109
style would still don't have the draft

1133
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:30,089
yet we have been waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bated haha</font>

1134
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:32,250
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to call for</font>

1135
01:00:30,089 --> 01:00:35,190
contribution for the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1136
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:38,460
increasing this and we can discuss over

1137
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:40,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list so Carson like so you can still</font>

1138
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">do a consensus call without a draft</font>

1139
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:44,760
right like so you can see if there's

1140
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:49,680
like eruption consensus and then Carson

1141
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:51,210
can post 7228 as Miss 00 and then you

1142
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,519
can continue working on it so don't let

1143
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:55,890
that stop you from right going to

1144
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:59,069
that you cannot see RFC and as a working

1145
01:00:55,890 --> 01:01:00,929
group lecture no I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> kidding Gary</font>

1146
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:06,569
that's between done before just do it

1147
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:10,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you yeah</font>

1148
01:01:06,569 --> 01:01:10,699
everything ends the pre
