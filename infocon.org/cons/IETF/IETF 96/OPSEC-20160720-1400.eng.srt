<font color="#E5E5E5">with the working group session itself it</font>

23
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,410
would be wonderful if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a scribe</font>

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:08,959
chopper channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you thank you</font>

33
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:12,260
so going forward we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

34
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,390
note well which you have probably you

35
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,700
know seen already a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times you know</font>

36
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,140
since the last idea if you have updated

37
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,260
it on you know on this slide here and

38
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,700
for the lost version I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lawyer</font>

39
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,560
so I have no clue<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was the</font>

40
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,380
difference between the one before the

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,030
last one and the last one but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

42
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:35,560
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into account it's important and</font>

43
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,560
then I believe we go to the agenda

44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,830
oh the door is<font color="#CCCCCC"> locked inbound traffic is</font>

45
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:53,300
forbidden by security policy you should

46
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:59,209
know this here it's a reflexive door so

47
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:03,349
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an ad here yeah what's it is</font>

48
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:08,390
even in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case Romano this one okay</font>

49
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:11,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so just just a quick recap you know</font>

50
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,190
what I denote IDF 95 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heirs we</font>

51
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:16,220
had like two<font color="#E5E5E5"> sections there were like</font>

52
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,889
pretty densely packed with documents and

53
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:22,190
with information so that went all pretty

54
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,990
well now as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> result of that at this</font>

55
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,270
point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we have like two active</font>

56
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,630
working group documents the extension

57
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">header filtering for v6 and the v6 no</font>

58
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,710
document which will be discussed here is

59
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first topic in our agenda here and</font>

60
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,570
we also ended up with one<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

61
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,110
relatively active document to do with

62
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:44,120
the ipv6 you know threat model elements

63
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,460
for the rest we didn't really have any

64
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,500
documents going towards iesg and all

65
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,419
other you know big disasters or you know

discussions in the working group list

70
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,870
you know the earth it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be improved i</font>

71

98
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:40,340
change the agenda so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

99
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:44,419

100
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:48,280
were looking for the speaker but ok

101
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,280
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we will simply switch the</font>

102
00:06:50,080 --> 00:07:10,070
agenda so am<font color="#E5E5E5"> i is it working here so</font>

103
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,070
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft which has been here</font>

104
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:16,640
from many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years which is about</font>

105
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:18,860
operational security for an ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

106
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:24,260
and basically all<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can securely</font>

107
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:29,060
operate an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6 Network it has been</font>

108
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:32,150
running since 2012 usually a good amount

109
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:37,570
of interaction what we change<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

110
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:41,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">latest revision which is 09 is basically</font>

111
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:44,719
adding some references to new document

112
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:47,870
notably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one from fred baker about</font>

113
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop-by-hop extension headers which</font>

114
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:54,260
was a major threat usually on network

115
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:56,150
but Fred proposal is basically changing

116
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,400
the behavior in this chain if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

117
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,159
nothing configure on an interface that

118
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,859
we cried the inspection of hot biopic

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,320
senators pretty much like RSVP for

120
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,100
instance you do not need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inspect</font>

121
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:13,580
so that's a proposed on their editors

122
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,980
well new references to existing document

123
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some point of time</font>

124
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:22,550
into this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> about an at 64 mainly</font>

125
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,960
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stage foot point of view but we</font>

126
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,050
see more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more deployment of</font>

127
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,900
stateless not 64 specifically in AP

128

brief sentence on this I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,280
comments so I stopped briefly just

145
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:26,720
before year was command which is pretty

146
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:30,199
long so don't ask and basically the

147
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,200
outward in 209 and just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sure</font>

148
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the change we made there to comply</font>

149
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,500
with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> review of others still kind of</font>

150
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,360
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the consensus in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group one of</font>

151
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,320
the part was that we said at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

152
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,890
beginning that RPV's is solemn during is

153
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:53,080
doable but in practice impossible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

154
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:56,240
we change it into in practice it may be

155
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,700
extremely difficult to remember except

156
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,330
if you have a good eye Pam cause they

157
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,950
need it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit easier which</font>

158
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and refusing as were regarding the</font>

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,660
ownership of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an address and text</font>

160
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,120
regarding law enforcement agency that

161
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,069
can tell you basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is dis</font>

162
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,670
address on oh can we block an address to

163
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:19,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that blah blah blah blah so we add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

164
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,180
to qualification there and mr. active

165
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,329
ownership

166
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,359
of an address and with technical

167
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,610
responsible could be very different we

168
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,490
remove the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text about law enforcement</font>

169
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:35,510
agency and simply add<font color="#CCCCCC"> the text because</font>

170
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:37,580
not only l EA can ask you to shut down

171
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,930
some traffic but you as well as an

172
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,310
operator you want to do it on your own

173
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:45,620
in case of whatever incident there so I

174
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,939
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are critical again if</font>

175
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:52,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't agree with the change that's</font>

recliner Lorenzo quality are in the room

178
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:02,199
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a ferry topic of them of</font>

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">mine as well when we talk about you la's</font>

180
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:09,470
there we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> edit we were never pushing</font>

181
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,560
forward delays in the text we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added the</font>

182
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,270
statement in blue there it's also

183
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,649
important to note that the idea does not

184
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:22,160
recommend the use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ula and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and TP v6</font>

185
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:24,200
now as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> author</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm afraid that i do</font>

186
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,630
not know exactly where this sentence

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,730
email is being set Fernando Fernando I

188
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,490
think there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I don't know if it's</font>

189
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,400
active but I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a document</font>

190
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,230
in v6 ops about the usage of your lies

191
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,600
yeah that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

192
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,950
honest I haven't been you know tracking

193
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,350
it so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

194
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,839
dropped or it's like still be imported

195
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,360
but might be useful it's already the

196
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,000
usage of la's already referred by this

197
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,720
document but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last sentence that the</font>

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,950
ITF does not recommend the use of you la

00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:00,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">NPT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate to write the sentence into a</font>

200
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,900
document without hitting as reference so

201
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,480
if anybody knows about the reference or

202
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:11,930
to find it i use<font color="#E5E5E5"> google sorry but i</font>

203
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:14,690
wasn't able to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I don't think</font>

204
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:18,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document isn't that mean I</font>

205
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:21,890
was told we will certainly I think it

206
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:26,899
was Lorenzo that we the IETF I said this

207
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:29,390
but if you don't the mic<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe Joe legally</font>

208
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:31,310
um this is literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> like one of the</font>

209
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,590
most fun things you can try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

210
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,219
recommendation on

211
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:41,550
out of any group in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IDF is what and</font>

212
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,550
how to do things with you la's so um

213
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:50,770
yeah I mean uh finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consensus</font>

214
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:53,050
position there that's like that you can

215
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:57,220
point to in this document is not likely

216
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:00,490
so that means you know your position

217
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,800
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this document okay so</font>

218
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,420
basically what you suggest you say it's

219
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,170
also important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that the authors</font>

220
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:12,719
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this document that do not recommend</font>

221
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:17,199
but it's coming kind of lowering

222
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,470
watering down I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sounds like a</font>

223
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,840
strong position you don't recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

224
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,580
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a good thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right from my</font>

225
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,610
vantage point there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other people in</font>

226
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:31,420
the ITF who disagree and that's part of

227
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:35,440
the reason like having a consensus that

228
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:41,110
says you should not do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this right is a</font>

229
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:43,360
little bit challenging right<font color="#CCCCCC"> gencor</font>

230
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,650
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think i read previous version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

231
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,980
the draft so are we talking about

232
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:50,800
explicitly say we do not recommend use

233
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,200
yo la combined with not not just don't

234
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,729
UCLA right that's correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it</font>

235
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,390
because it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually clear from</font>

00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,040
the slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> one sentence and you don't</font>

238
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,089
not the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably we are not</font>

recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ian using them together that's</font>

indeed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> reduce accounting use</font>

247
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:36,340
accounting can also lock the use of ipv6

static IP v6 addresses even it doesn't

259

whitelist approach I do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> know let's</font>

285
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:22,959
say mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 so I have no reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

286
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,510
accept routing header and destination

287
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,550
header on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff it really a</font>

288
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">watch list approach only allowing let's</font>

289
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:34,180
say UDP<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP ESP aah and fragmentation</font>

290
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,250
again no recommendation and exhaust list

291
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,050
but the recommendation is to use a

292
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:44,620
whitelist effort to drop what you do not

293
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:47,890
need biyanka Panthers will not send a

294
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:50,770
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments like such as removing</font>

295
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,180

<font color="#CCCCCC">23 years ago there were a lot of</font>

303
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,869
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> network operation and</font>

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:19,030
whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a native ipv6</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network it changed nothing because</font>

308
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:34,030
it's still a pv6 only<font color="#E5E5E5"> or which is only</font>

309
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,429
prison at 64 so for me I can cite it in

310
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,790
one line but I do not need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write more</font>

311
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:44,770

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:51,879
talk about the privacy section I don't

314
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:55,150
see how it would fit here that's about

315
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,429
operational security of a network if you

316
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,780
want to say privacy of a network don't

317
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:00,640
know whether we can still really apply

318
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,059
this but it should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different</font>

326
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:28,919
for texts i'm skipping them only

327
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:32,168
focusing on the most important point and

328
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,809
one is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a draft</font>

329
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:36,820
which is informational but in some place

330
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:42,610
you are recommend doing recommendation

331
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:45,309

best practice document they are not

333
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:53,290
aiming this we want to be informational

334
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:57,970
to be some<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's simpler so you have any</font>

335
00:18:53,290 --> 00:19:05,918
suggestions or we can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or at</font>

336
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:08,140
anybody in the room Lee Howard well so

337
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,330
we could make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it best practice path</font>

338
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,919
that's one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could do and I I'd</font>

339
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,820
be okay with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the other alternative</font>

340
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,220
is

341
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,939
to just word some things differently to

342
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,500
say consider the use of can make it me

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:26,919
or be more of a considerations document

344

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay announcing for these documents will</font>

00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:32,190
be 22 code<font color="#E5E5E5"> about best given practice so</font>

346
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:35,139
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the text and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> afraid</font>

347
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:38,139
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we started this document</font>

348
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:41,408
in 2012 just before the world that pv6

349
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:44,500
lounge we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 is new</font>

350
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:46,179
and you and you and you on one side<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

351
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,720
no Manu I mean there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in this</font>

352
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:53,379
room at least 50 see if i can see that i

353
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,169
use to run ipv6 Network safely for 45

354
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:58,779
years now so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more new for them</font>

355
00:19:55,169 --> 00:20:01,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but maybe it's still new for</font>

356
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:04,059
somebody which is reading the document

357
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:07,090
all fully before deploying activities in

358
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:09,519
the network not five<font color="#E5E5E5"> years after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

359
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:12,519
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will change them out the text but it's</font>

360
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:16,360
still for newcomers in the ipv6 world so

361
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:20,470
i will keep the new but change it

362
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,110
somehow any<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got some proposal as well</font>

363
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:26,620
for the ula press and PTV 6 section

364
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:29,439
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one sentence and i do not</font>

365
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,389
want to open this can of form so i would

366
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest that we keep this sentence here</font>

367
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:38,529
I mean changing authors with the deny

368
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:44,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">ATF many anguish as I said now there was</font>

369
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:46,720
a section about 3gpp which basically it

370
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,259
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> yuri rotting it a couple of years</font>

371
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago and we simply cut and paste because</font>

372
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:57,399
familiy gpp is a different vocabulary

373
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,620
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same concept so and we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

374
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:04,658
do some rewarding so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i read between the</font>

375
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:09,580
line that Lee was volunteering to do to

376
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:13,779
be writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

377
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,189
that's it so by points that again i

378
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:19,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">would love to really to finish this</font>

379
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:23,980
document and get up clinical question

380
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:26,840
about section about I using multicast

381
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,660
and battery lives and so all right

382
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,449
you for some reason do not refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC</font>

383
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:35,600
777 to which recommends vendors to use

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,400
unicast erase that arrays to reduce a

385
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,020
battery life consumption and do you

386
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be explicitly say that</font>

387
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,400
multicast snooping might be useful

388
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,140
feature in this case because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have not</font>

389
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,850
found any reference to it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

390
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:52,730
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay will you thank you</font>

391
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:55,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Fernando um it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not that I suggest that</font>

392
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:58,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">you cover this topic because it might</font>

393
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,889
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee might be like you know my stock</font>

394
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,350
the document but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were covering</font>

395
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,900
savvy I was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that in</font>

396
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,909
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists or actually in practice they</font>

397
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:12,050
are discussing mac address randomization

398
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:15,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm curious about you know what</font>

399
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,340
effect that might have on what some of

400
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,860
the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are currently</font>

401
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,020
employing I'm not suggesting that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

402
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,389
cover that because I guess that is like

403
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,629
territory that it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like unknown</font>

404
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,640
to some extent but I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just thinking a</font>

405
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,070
lot about that yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be an</font>

406
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,870
interesting problem but yeah as you said

407
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,820
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure whether I want to get this</font>

408
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,800
out it's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been working on</font>

409
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">this for four years of prolly i agree</font>

with you with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that okay but thank you</font>

Lee Howard you had asked about a privacy

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,470
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right as I look back at the the</font>

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,090
title<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the abstract we might just</font>

415
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,730
because we like to have a privacy

416
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,860
considerations see if there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

417
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,540
of thinking out loud so for a network

418
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,340
operator what are their privacy

419
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,980
considerations there might be logging

420
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,649
considerations of customer proprietary

addresses especially if they're you know

425
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:21,770
FFF e addresses that sounds like a

426
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,820
reasonably short section so that you

427
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:31,129
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to I'm going to send you</font>

428

<font color="#E5E5E5">text for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> privacy considerations and hope</font>

429
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,490
that somebody else will post the list or

430
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,850
something and say hey I thought of this

431
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:40,999
also might go in that section as for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

432
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,408
3gpp section I think my comment was

433
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,329
this was educational for me because I

434
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:46,129
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know anything about how 3gpp does</font>

435
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:47,509
this which makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard for me</font>

436
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:52,428
to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest what it ought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

437
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:54,889
um having said that because I want to

438
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:58,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting this out I will</font>

439
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:59,478
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who does not wait</font>

440
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:04,219
looking around anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here know</font>

441
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:10,459
anything about 3gpp<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh hey it's quite a</font>

442
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:14,929
fight and so you have the guy knowing

443
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:20,889
the most in the room let let me so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

444
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:23,299
had yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean mysteriously there a</font>

445
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:25,698
fair number of people in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> who've</font>

446
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:28,549
worked for companies that you're either

447
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:32,359
members or consumers of their

448
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:33,709
specifications so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I think we</font>

449
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:38,239
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to find some input there</font>

450
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:39,949
ya fada so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your help so we</font>

451
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:45,979
expect a fourth alternate in the draft

452
00:24:39,949 --> 00:24:47,929
with audio text thank you he also you

453
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:50,749
know from perspective that his draft has

454
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:52,009
been active from like 2012 you said so

455
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:53,659
it will be interesting to come to a

456
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:56,029
closure so what I was thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

457
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,129
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of try to facilitate that</font>

458
00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:00,049
if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually spin like you know</font>

459
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,279
other quickly like Ashton<font color="#E5E5E5"> you check</font>

460
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:04,158
actually with the main people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

461
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,649
provided you with comments and then we

462
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,509
do like a short you know lost working

463
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:20,768
group last call and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually</font>

464
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:20,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">move this thing forward so my this</font>

465
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,310
good afternoon everyone my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mario</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">georgescu I'm from nine state of Science</font>

467
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:42,230

468
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:44,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">an attempt to build a threat model for</font>

469
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:47,750
ipv6 trends and technologies here so

470
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,020
yeah let's dive in essentially I<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

471
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,520
my slide I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing a lot in BMW</font>

472
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:56,000
gee maybe some other people know it as

473
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,950
well yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure many or all of you</font>

474
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,780
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the lack of backwards</font>

475
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:03,050
compatibility in ipv6 and the fact that

476
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:05,060
we only have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pistol six percent</font>

477
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:09,379
of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> key v6 preference in like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

478
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:11,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">wide usage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that yeah we'll have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

479
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,360
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the transition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> period and</font>

480
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,890
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually probably worked on</font>

481
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,290
developing these trends and technologies

482
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:22,700
there there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple now there's</font>

483
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:24,560
there's great diversity and I it begs

484
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question like what are the</font>

485
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,360
implications of using<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fraction</font>

486
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,040
technologies implications on security of

487
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,629
using Eastern Asian technologies in a

488
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:38,210
network I think there are like very fair

489
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:42,170
amount of security considerations in one

490
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,900
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC's already published but in at</font>

491
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:47,270
least my opinion and other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

492
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,280
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to there's some lack of structure</font>

493
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:52,760
that's that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to bring</font>

494
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,670
in with this thread model and we are

495
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the stride approach we</font>

496
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:01,400
have a reference now thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all for</font>

497
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:04,939
noticing there wasn't one on the draft

498
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,710
so it's referencing experiences since we

499
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,030
thread modeling at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft from Adam</font>

500
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:12,980
short stack Eddie on that's the main

501
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:15,139
point of the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> is prob it provides</font>

502
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">complementary security considerations to</font>

503
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:21,200
RSC 494<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and as collateral dope</font>

504
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,010
contributions we think this might apply

505
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,260
to like protocols developed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDF</font>

506
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:30,680
some of the generic steps that are

507
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:34,250
considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> for stride so</font>

508
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,830
now the steps are fairly simple so first

509
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:39,650
of all we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to establish sort of</font>

510
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,689
function<font color="#E5E5E5"> or detail the function that the</font>

511
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:46,670
transition technology is supposed to be

512
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:48,080
doing also we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we propose the way to</font>

513
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,590
generically classify generation

514
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,960
technologies in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beamed up BMW draft</font>

515
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,490
and we're thinking this giant

516
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,620
classification can be reused here

517
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">because some of the threat analysis data</font>

518
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:03,229
can be reused for multiple duration

519
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,330
technologies then of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we'll have</font>

520
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,790
to decompose the technology look at the

521
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:12,919
sub components look at the sub protocols

522
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:17,090
and essentially establish more of the

523
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,090
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> area then the most important part</font>

524
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:23,240
identified the threats we will have

525
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:26,320
strike the data flow diagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> association</font>

526
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we proposed some levels of trust</font>

527
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,909
documenting some of the threats in a

528
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,439
standardized format and yeah look at

529
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,170
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complex threats that might</font>

530
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,500
arise between the like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> combination</font>

531
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:41,420
of the basic threats and yeah validation

532
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:46,010
has the the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> step through some</font>

533
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:49,220
penetration testing or or alike so this

534
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:53,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">is I'm fairly sure most of you know</font>

535
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:56,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">about stride but just to give a quick</font>

536
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">overview stride this essentially I'm</font>

537
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:00,110
mnemonic and a classification model

538
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:03,350
which stands for spoofing tampering

539
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:05,270
repudiation information disclosure

540
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:10,219
denial of service and elevation of

541
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:11,930
privilege and these threat to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it so</font>

542
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,790
the third classification also gives a

543
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:16,010
rough idea on how the trash can be

544
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:19,240
mitigated because the desired properties

545
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:22,010
associated course our authentication

546
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,070
integrity accountability confidentiality

547
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:27,680
availability and authorization and yeah

548
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,030
just some examples at this level because

549
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,900
we're talking about they are three layer

550
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:35,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies and yeah you may think</font>

551
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:39,140
well how does elevation of privilege

552
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:40,670
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> look work here well if you get an</font>

553
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,390
access to a privileged part of the

554
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:47,500
network that's salvation of privilege

555
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:50,180
now yeah in establishing the function we

556
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:53,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">we gave some examples for the general</font>

557
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:55,550
classic the categories we define so for

558
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:59,510
example for those that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network the</font>

559
00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:02,210
function would be yeah well I know this

560
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:05,150
is the generic step this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the section</font>

561
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:08,140
5.1 for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. engine technologies so</font>

562
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:12,580
ensuring a safe data exchange between a

563
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:17,000
nodes over a tall stack infrastructure

564
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:18,710
now in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the general categories</font>

565
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,170
and how they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> associated with the</font>

566
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,090
existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> transition technologies this is</font>

567
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,890
so the four groups would be dual stack

568
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,439
single translation double translation

569
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:29,180
and encapsulation and is how this is how

570
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,130
some of the trends and technologies we'd

571
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:34,760
fall into these groups like have draw a

572
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:37,730
light layer operator operations RFC 242

573
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:43,250
13 or and double translation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 64 X</font>

574
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:45,740
lat and so on now there were some there

575
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:49,130
wasn't discussions we had received<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

576
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:54,830
feedback form Fernando Don about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DFT</font>

577
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:57,620
elements and how we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like that</font>

578
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,540
how the elements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were used in</font>

579
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:03,229
Microsoft and network elements could be

580
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:05,240
mapped and I guess this this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly</font>

581
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:08,150
controversial I I don't really know so

582
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:12,830
this is how I define them for now if you

583
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:17,110
have any feedback it's welcome now this

584
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:21,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the how an essentially a dual stack</font>

585
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:24,500
model with all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> that use case would</font>

586
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,480
be so we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer device</font>

587
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,130
that's an external entity and then we'll

588
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a process that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doll stack</font>

589
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:33,320
node and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll have a provider data</font>

590
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:35,510
store which well we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect</font>

591
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,399
to and then we would want to look at the

592
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:40,129
protected assets and the entry points

593
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,650
and the way I said it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> cape these can</font>

594
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:45,230
all be this is the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can all</font>

595
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,240
the entry points and as well every data

596
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:52,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">its exchanged in the system should be</font>

597
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:54,210
protected yeah again this is also the

598
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:58,320
thing that can be discussed

599
00:31:54,210 --> 00:32:02,190
and yeah we would want some feedback on

600
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:06,330
that as well now there's the the stride

601
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:09,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">eft Association will associate some some</font>

602
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:13,409
of the threat threats to certain types

603
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:18,210
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD elements so for example an</font>

604
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:19,980
external entity is prone to stuffing and

605
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:22,560
repudiation threats more than other

606
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,720
elements so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can help here</font>

607
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,159
as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> for network elements that's</font>

608
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,980
why it would be very important to

609
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:32,100
clearly identify the relationship

610
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,930
between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DFD elements and the actual</font>

611
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:38,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">network elements that go into a</font>

612
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:43,350
tradition technology yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then from</font>

613
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:46,379
these you can essentially well get a

614
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:50,280
rough idea about likelihood let's say of

615
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:53,820
of a certain threat by associating the

616
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:58,200
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> elements with the likelihood</font>

617
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:59,939
of them being exploited yeah now in

618
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,970
documenting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tres this is the format</font>

619
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,710
we we fall off so we'll have like some

620
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:07,110
threat ID which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be a code</font>

621
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:11,070
and if there's a need for having that in

622
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:14,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF the code could be like I'll show</font>

623
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:17,250
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide something like IDF tdb</font>

624
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,139
which is thread database and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then some</font>

625
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,320
like the code for the protocol and then

626
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:25,890
some serial number<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I went</font>

627
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,330
too far yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we will have like</font>

628
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:30,110
some description like a samurai's

629
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:32,580
description of the threat we will have

630
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,770
an association<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> strata</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lines</font>

631
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:38,100
because the thread can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be potentially</font>

632
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:42,720
associated with all the we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font>

633
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:45,360
to trade<font color="#CCCCCC"> pacific like classes then some</font>

634
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,810
details about the mitigation so what

635
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:52,020
they actually exists so far or if it

636
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:55,080
doesn't what should we do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the</font>

637
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:58,740
likelihood which is depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how you</font>

638
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,270
build a DFT what's the level of

639
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,000
likelihood and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this can be like a</font>

640
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:05,460
stepwise fing it can be low high and or

641
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,559
you can have some intermediary number

642
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,289
there I

643
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:13,409
the an idea was to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

644
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:18,210
CBS s scoring and then you'll have an

645
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:20,279
expert database of well an expert

646
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:22,379
analysis and then some numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> for each</font>

647
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:25,250
of the threats that can be that can be

648
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:28,469
an expansion of this simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-high</font>

649
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:31,289
system and then some validation so if

650
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:33,268
the threat was validated yeah some

651
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:36,629
details<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it was validated and</font>

652
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:39,598
or if it was validated so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

653
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:41,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">examples I took like that's art spoofing</font>

654
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,889
so you can basically do everything is

655
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:47,059
except except for elevation of privilege

656
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:49,950
and yeah there are some mitigation

657
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:53,690
solutions already nobody probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

658
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:58,649
static arp entries and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> our watches</font>

659
00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:00,269
is a better one now if you look at some

660
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,309
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those basic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> threads I presented</font>

661
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:04,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier some of them can be combined to</font>

662
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:07,920
actually have a bit like a bigger impact

663
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,859
or higher likelihood so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah if you</font>

664
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,079
combine her harp one which was the ARP

665
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:16,250
spoofing<font color="#CCCCCC"> thread with the neighbor</font>

666
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:21,839
discovery I forgot which one that was

667
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:25,829
for what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there anyways so yeah</font>

668
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:29,788
you could essentially get a higher

669
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:32,579
likelihood of of exploitation and then

670
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:34,289
you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information about</font>

671
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:38,880
you how you could mitigate this complex

672
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:40,950
threat so yeah has for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clutter</font>

673
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">district contribution as I was saying</font>

674
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:48,868
earlier so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could have some thread</font>

675
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,299
database for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF Phyllis desired we</font>

676
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:53,250
could also reuse some of these generic

677
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:55,410
steps to actually give some structure to

678
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:58,380
security considerations which to me at

679
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:01,980
least and many or some other people I've

680
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:04,769
talked to a lack a bit of structure like

681
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,119
if you have some simple steps like if I

682
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:08,839
identify the function associated

683
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:13,140
technology with some kind of generic

684
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:15,890
category they compose it what's what's I

685
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:19,390
don't know some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of diagram and then</font>

686
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:22,180
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the threats and</font>

687
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:25,170
you try to validate them so that's

688
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,578
that's about it for me I now have some

689
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:31,150
questions for up sex so how many people

690
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:37,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">have read the draft so I know Fernando</font>

691
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:42,490
husband and Joel I guess two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

692
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:45,700
nightly yeah I have a couple of a couple

693
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:52,359
of questions yeah sure um okay well

694
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:55,618
first um it's a good idea I think in

695
00:36:52,359 --> 00:37:00,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">some ways okay I have some questions</font>

696
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:03,369
about um you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> devil is in the</font>

697
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:05,769
details yeah sure and and how how to

698
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:08,470
actually go about doing this so if

699
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:13,140
you'll go back to your stride yep slide

700
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:16,089
I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay first as far as that</font>

701
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,759
do you mean like the yellow journals

702
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:21,480
just one yes yeah yeah well a couple

703
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,680
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> right on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one okay um</font>

704
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,480
there's I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's we could</font>

705
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,680
probably we should probably should

706
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,990
probably do more on what that is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

707
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,368
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there's more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

708
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,160
mean I can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> write off top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my head</font>

709
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:38,170
i can think leakage you know people use

710
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,359
certain fields doing a formation<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

711
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to leave ya information disclosure</font>

712
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:47,529
they linked data you know and then to

713
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:52,058
confidentiality what's a matter of

714
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:55,569
opinion<font color="#CCCCCC"> is confidentiality let me say</font>

715
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:59,440
that because if it's my network my data

716
00:37:55,569 --> 00:38:01,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm an enterprise I own it I need to see</font>

717
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for certain things if you're if</font>

718
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:07,029
you're a you know a one-out optimizer

719
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:09,130
you need to see certain parts of the

720
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:12,220
data you know I mean so so it'sit's

721
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:14,319
there's more nuanced than that for

722
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,660
confidentiality you see what I'm saying

723
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:19,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">the III think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there I mean there's more</font>

724
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:23,410
categories and we I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a good as</font>

725
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:25,690
I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a good idea I think I if you</font>

726
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:28,180
have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestions for more categories</font>

727
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,859
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stride yet i'll be welcome but</font>

728
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,779
you said leakage that's definitely

729
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:35,620
information disclosure any other ideas

730
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,790
well I mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidentiality</font>

731
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,910
evidential it is the property

732
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:41,930
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> informative sure if you're</font>

733
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,029
worried that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to have</font>

734
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:46,640
information disclosure you should

735
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,590
improve confidentiality that's that's

736
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,020
that's a that's not the category it's

737
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,970
just the litigation solution I guess I

738
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:56,780
guess what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean to say is like it's</font>

739
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:59,089
like that kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like Pat if I</font>

740
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:01,280
see passive monitoring what I would I

741
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:04,760
start thinking is like you shouldn't

742
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:08,930
take traces because you can see the

743
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:12,140
decrypted data inside there and if I own

744
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:14,569
that data I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have every right to see that</font>

745
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:16,670
data you see what I mean and so that's

746
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:21,380
not really an infant information

747
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:22,880
disclosure category<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am easy i mean i'm</font>

748
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">not sure but we can talk about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

749
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,960
and then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at length</font>

750
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:29,120
and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they get to the list as</font>

751
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,430
well if there's like more to say about

752
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:35,569
it Lee Howard so yeah we can discuss on

753
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:38,750
the list but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna discuss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it here</font>

754
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:40,790
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time yeah sure because I so I</font>

755
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:43,910
think nilly knees right obviously that

756
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:47,180
you know yes in some cases be able to

757
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:48,710
see data is is appropriate but it's

758
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,720
still a threat I mean that I think we

759
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:53,840
still need still model it as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

760
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,220
and maybe we need a note saying and it

761
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,540
may be a considerations a separate

762
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,759
section of the document saying there are

763
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,500
other considerations we're doing some of

764
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,010
these things is appropriate their attire

765
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:06,350
yeah sure no no okay no I was I was

766
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:08,540
understanding the the mileage suggestion

767
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:10,220
as this is not exhaustive so this is not

768
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,230
complete you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something that</font>

769
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,540
doesn't fit in these categories so

770
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,460
that's what I'm I'm kind of challenging

771
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,170
now like do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys know any thread</font>

772
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,720
that doesn't fit here because I don't

773
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">think so honestly like stride is a</font>

774
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,009
fairly generic way of categorizing

775
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:28,759
threads and it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to do so</font>

776
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:30,380
with every thread right that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

777
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,880
of course that's it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

778
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,460
discussion point that's that's

779
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,090
definitely yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah like of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course well</font>

780
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:41,300
a nice p would legitimately like analyze

781
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:43,280
traffic traces yeah that's lots may be

782
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,870
normal but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm saying that's not that</font>

783
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,910
that doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not a threat it</font>

784
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:49,589
thread<font color="#CCCCCC"> right exactly and that's exactly</font>

785
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,390
what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is it's a threat it's</font>

786
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,740
covered here we may it may not be a

787
00:40:51,390 --> 00:41:01,710
threat we want to mitigate it yes in all

788
00:40:52,740 --> 00:41:04,080
circumstances<font color="#CCCCCC"> mm thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so one topic</font>

789
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:06,270
of discussion is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want this</font>

790
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,600
document which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally find useful</font>

791
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:12,180
become a working group document now to

792
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,190
be honest on my side it's in a security

793
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:17,460
document but it's not an operational

794
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:19,620
security document so it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really</font>

795
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,500
belong so this week a nobody must be it

796
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,819
should be somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF</font>

797
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,980
secretary after like we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

798
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,930
find out which which working group it

799
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">would fit best the recommendation came</font>

800
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:34,799
from from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Farrell and also fred</font>

801
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,260
baker like we were talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

802
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,750
it may be in v6 ops but it doesn't

803
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">really fit because it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mostly security</font>

804
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:46,950
so then we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC it</font>

805
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,870
might apply like Fred's point was does

806
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,879
it give mitigation because if it gives

807
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,580
mitigations that means it's all like

808
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,680
it's useful for operators right so that

809
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:58,710
was the that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of it being</font>

810
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,049
useful maybe knob sec now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure</font>

811
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">so yeah of course the working group who</font>

812
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:06,780
has the last decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like they're</font>

813
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,430
if there's interest in that sure yeah

814
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:13,860
the mitigation part is indeed operation

815
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:19,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">yet a couple other things did this the</font>

816
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:21,560
the UM threat database I am I am I

817
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:26,400
getting this that you're suggesting that

818
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:28,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody it I ETF or somewhere maintain</font>

819
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,680
this threat database or are we gonna get

820
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:33,840
it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> searcher or I mean yes it can be</font>

821
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,990
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft like it doesn't have to be a</font>

822
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,990
standard document it can be a like like

823
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:42,120
version draft it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to version 100</font>

824
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,950
that can be maintained as a draft we

825
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,810
took just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table with the threats</font>

826
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,899
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my rough idea of how it</font>

827
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:56,340
can be solved not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like this is</font>

828
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:57,540
my suggestion the reason I have a little

829
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,240
bit of a problem with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

830
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,220
mean there's companies

831
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,529
that you know do like virus checking and

832
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,169
stuff they make a living out of doing

833
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:08,720
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's modified daily I mean that</font>

834
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:10,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">just seems like I mean I think at a</font>

835
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,009
higher level there's some real good

836
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,840
ideas here but maintaining a threat

837
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:17,270
database when there could be something

838
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,760
coming out every other minute I know

839
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:22,009
it's a threat is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a vulnerability</font>

840
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,050
database that's a completely different

841
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:26,090
thing this is a thread database so these

842
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:28,040
are more generic than than like you you

843
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,780
just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what the threat could</font>

844
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,910
be right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do an analysis and then you</font>

845
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,950
validate it and that's about it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

846
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

847
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:39,020
at versions you don't have to do horner

848
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:41,990
ability analysis which is a completely I

849
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,310
think they different thing okay all

850
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,250
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not understanding what</font>

851
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:48,580
you meant by threats then yeah well the

852
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,290
chances<font color="#E5E5E5"> are it's a unmitigated</font>

853
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,690
essentially vulnerability in like a

854
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:56,060
generic definition i know i guess i

855
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess like something a lot that's that's</font>

856
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,350
like protocol like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a protocol level</font>

857
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:03,259
protocol security so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

858
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:05,509
protocol you analyze inner workings and

859
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,550
then you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is a potential</font>

860
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:12,260
threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it's not mitigated then</font>

861
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:15,200
yet it becomes a vulnerability so you

862
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:17,840
say this particular thing is is subject

863
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,689
to our resource depletion attack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

864
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:23,060
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna say what kind of resource</font>

865
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:25,580
depletion is that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what you</font>

866
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:28,940
meant well you could specify that

867
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:31,250
defeats like a stateful not 64<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

868
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,290
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could specify yeah that's</font>

869
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:38,030
that's one of the the threats that right

870
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:40,790
he likes ya state table exhaustion

871
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:43,369
exactly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a threat yeah that's a</font>

872
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:45,020
threat that can be in that thread list

873
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:47,510
or database whatever you want to call it

874
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:50,630
sure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft that you</font>

875
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">proposed that's swell it can be a draft</font>

876
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,680
it can be anything for for now it's in

877
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:57,560
this draft it can be moved into a

878
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,710
separate document if that's how it's

879
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:02,660
going to evolve I don't know Fernando if

880
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:05,540
you run<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comments regarding the</font>

881
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,310
database I have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> where that would</font>

882
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:11,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">be doable but prolly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> joel has a better</font>

883
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea about that we were talking about</font>

884
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,890
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know possible venues I think</font>

885
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:18,200
that it all depends for example if you

886
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:21,500
are just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on something</font>

887
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:23,598
specific or whether you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do like</font>

888
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,849
to produce a generic document if it was

889
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,980
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a generic document like a model</font>

890
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:30,680
without focusing on any technology I

891
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:32,630
guess Sark could be an option no I for

892
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,060
us if you're focusing on anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

893
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,650
is specific I guess I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it</font>

894
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,930
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here but it's like more clothes</font>

895
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,480
like closer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what up sec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dust and</font>

896
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:43,220
something that is generic now when it

897
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:49,550
comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the model itself can you go</font>

898
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:52,220
like forward one slide sure no no no no

899
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:55,670
this one this one yeah this is we had

900
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:57,520
some pizza expression so I think that

901
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:00,050
you know having something that tries to

902
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,170
structure the way we analyze stuff is

903
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:05,930
useful right but for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like let's</font>

904
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,880
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I trust the stuff that you</font>

905
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:10,549
produce in the ad and it's a ok I want

906
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use it for me this light is the one</font>

907
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:14,390
that is critical<font color="#CCCCCC"> well it's very</font>

908
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:17,359
important I want to apply your model to

909
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:19,368
stop that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm doing i need to be able to</font>

910
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,740
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm at something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I find in</font>

911
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:24,230
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network to the molded</font>

912
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:26,750
that you're using and I don't know if I

913
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:28,069
haven't checked like the latest revision

914
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,319
of the document it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> totally</font>

915
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:33,589
different at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took a look at</font>

916
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:36,079
the document i couldn't myself I mean

917
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:38,450
could be my fault but I couldn't figure

918
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,420
out how I could map something that I

919
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:43,189
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example from an aspect into the</font>

920
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,750
model that you have here and then the

921
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:46,220
part that for me is critical I mean I

922
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,839
need to be able to like no I

923
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,509
automatically understand okay or do you

924
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,880
structure it yeah yeah and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

925
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:55,760
for me this is the part that is key like

926
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,069
you know being able to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model</font>

927
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,440
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> a some technology being able to</font>

928
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:03,380
apply it uh like it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

929
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,390
sprite forward yeah I don't I haven't

930
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">read the latest version so maybe that</font>

931
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:10,220
now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but no it's exactly like I</font>

932
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:12,980
put in written in green if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

933
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:15,740
if it can it's fitz noticeable but ya

934
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:18,770
like like if I wouldn't green the the

935
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:20,839
things that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed and I'm still not</font>

936
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:22,819
satisfied I think it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot better</font>

937
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:25,310
than this and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly know how</font>

938
00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:26,550
so your feedback would be good other

939
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:29,370
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that want to put you</font>

940
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:36,540
they're welcome as well so yeah yeah

941
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:39,720
that's thank you yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Julian I wanted</font>

942
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:43,170
to just respond to um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a point</font>

943
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">nalini was trying to dig into um and I</font>

944
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,820
will preface this by saying aye despite

945
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,110
having been the chair of this working

946
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,570
group at one time and being<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

947
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:53,790
responsible ad i'm not an upset person

948
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:57,660
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just lob requirements at me from</font>

949
00:47:53,790 --> 00:48:01,110
the other side of the company but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

950
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:03,750
my understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of why why you would</font>

951
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:06,210
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with stride or say some</font>

952
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:08,480
alternative models such as dread is that

953
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:12,120
you need a way to frame the discussion

954
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,430
not so much that necessarily your

955
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,109
problems like fit into the convenient

956
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:18,750
boxes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it gives you a</font>

957
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:25,310
terminology that you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> from and</font>

958
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:27,510
a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick apart the problem and the</font>

959
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:29,549
variation between the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm</font>

960
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:32,670
mostly familiar with which our stride

961
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:34,860
and dread is sort of you know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of</font>

962
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:37,770
analyzing starting from where the

963
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:39,960
problem areas might be versus what the

964
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:42,270
consequences are sort of where dread

965
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,680
starts and then works backwards which is

966
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:48,500
like looking in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong end of the</font>

967
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:51,899
horse as far as I'm concerned um but but

968
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:54,330
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speaks to what</font>

969
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:57,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">it what a database is which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of</font>

970
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:59,520
um since you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this category</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of boxes</font>

971
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,950
you essentially identify where the

972
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,020
potential problem areas in the protocol

973
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:06,330
are and then when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

974
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:08,430
question of vulnerabilities those

975
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,230
actually fit backwards into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boxes</font>

976
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:12,089
that you've created because this

977
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:14,970
vulnerability is associated with this

978
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:17,040
problem area right but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sort</font>

979
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of starting out with a taxonomy of the</font>

980
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,710
protocol so that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify where</font>

981
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:24,810
the problem areas are and so um the

982
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:27,630
early portion of this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

983
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:29,790
explanation of stride goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

984
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,470
this is the this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our methodology and</font>

985
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:33,180
then what we actually care about here is

986
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:37,919
must see the meat of it which is where

987
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:40,020
the problem areas and I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

988
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,880
little clarifying in terms of

989
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:48,750
how this stuff works like i said<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

990
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:51,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">an expert in it but thank you Lee Howard</font>

991
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:56,940
I've taken a closer look at the document

992
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:58,920
in the last five minutes stride is based

993
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,600
on a Microsoft Research pay yeah right

994
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,540
yeah yeah do they have intellectual

995
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:07,259
property rights on it I think on the

996
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">paper this paper not really and the</font>

997
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,560
reason I'm asking is because you don't

998
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:14,490
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a normative reference to that</font>

999
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,890
paper uh it's it's I think it's a

1000
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:18,870
normative reference like the one I put

1001
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:21,509
in but I'm not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might be mistaken</font>

1002
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:24,799
but this is an academic paper that they

1003
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:33,270
published that doesn't necessarily mean

1004
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:35,040
that well I might know yeah so yeah Joey

1005
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:38,720
I can comment on that a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit yeah</font>

1006
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:41,370
I asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the informative reference so</font>

1007
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:44,970
it's my understanding that they have not

1008
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:47,339
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> any claims on the methodology um I</font>

1009
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:49,799
think one of the authors of that paper

1010
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:52,440
now works for my company so if I find

1011
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,030
out that there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else to that</font>

1012
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,460
I will have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> file a third party to</font>

1013
00:50:54,030 --> 00:51:00,000
close disclosure<font color="#E5E5E5"> but or maybe a</font>

1014
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:02,730
first-party I don't know anyway I looked

1015
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,250
and didn't see any so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font>

1016
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:07,500
they don't exist but I did I did ask

1017
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:09,390
that question at some point yeah that's

1018
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,720
so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I from so</font>

1019
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:14,730
just just to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clarify so I also</font>

1020
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,919
write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wrote an academic paper that was</font>

1021
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:19,590
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same subject I just tried to</font>

1022
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:23,280
bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> here as well and discuss it</font>

1023
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:25,770
from what I know this is not covered by

1024
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,350
the any IPR I certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want you</font>

1025
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:30,330
to think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that I don't</font>

1026
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:32,220
really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a formal methodology</font>

1027
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:36,740
for doing threat assessment you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so</font>

1028
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:39,720
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we would love to have this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

1029
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,160
I'm struggling with where I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1030
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,870
see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> since the question was where</font>

1031
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:46,500
should the work be exactly that's a good

1032
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:50,250
part of my concern is um I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1033
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:53,490
that stride or or another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thread so</font>

1034
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:54,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">another threat assessment model ought to</font>

1035
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:57,779
be published<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1036
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,700
and alone RFC probably by sag would be

1037
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,830
the place<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would think to do it so we</font>

1038
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:05,069
have here's a way to do threat modeling

1039
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:06,630
then unfortunately where I really think

1040
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:08,220
this work is going right now you said

1041
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:10,560
here's a way to do threat modeling of

1042
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:12,299
trial ipv6 transition mechanisms but

1043
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,029
know what you have is a way to do threat

1044
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,070
modeling of everything yeah I will see

1045
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:19,110
that I would see this as a collateral

1046
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:21,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">into like a be collateral contribution</font>

1047
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:24,120
yeah so I in order so what I what I

1048
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,970
really want is not not so much

1049
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:29,520
methodology is I want the threat

1050
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:31,950
assessment oh yeah so that's that's the

1051
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,980
part that I did here like there's a huge

1052
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:36,689
threat analysis that i did so if time

1053
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:40,170
allows please please check it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1054
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:41,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm sure you have a vast knowledge in v6</font>

1055
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:44,700
up so it's I'm sorry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

1056
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:46,439
appendix a no it's in appendix yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1057
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:49,020
so depending so it's usually haven't

1058
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:52,290
read all the pending say yes sir so it's

1059
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:55,650
a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> you trip well I don't know</font>

1060
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:58,320
through threat analysis let's call it

1061
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay first list so this may be something</font>

1062
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,760
where we actually need to go solicit

1063
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:04,110
specific reviewers who are either

1064
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,210
authors or deployers of each of the

1065
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:08,040
technology has to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> they you</font>

1066
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,540
know that they correct this because yes

1067
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,009
I've done I've done some v6 but I

1068
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,509
haven't deployed you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1069
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:15,600
intimately familiar i haven't done

1070
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:16,830
deployment of every transition so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1071
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,420
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably going to be needed</font>

1072
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,950
in order to advance this but I actually

1073
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,170
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we probably need the meta document</font>

1074
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:24,509
first that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then reply refer back</font>

1075
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:26,700
to and so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the methodology</font>

1076
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:28,560
document separated out from the turret

1077
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,210
on the threaded from the actual analysis

1078
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,160
have that have the model be one document

1079
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">via now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the results of the model applied</font>

1080
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,660
to transition mechanisms be another

1081
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,250
document and then in the report of the

1082
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:41,129
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggesting that is that we</font>

1083
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:42,810
can then<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest to you know I can go to</font>

1084
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:45,450
other working groups and say hey have

1085
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:46,710
you looked at the stride RFC and have

1086
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,720
you done a threat assessment based on

1087
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:54,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah that sounds like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

1088
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:56,669
idea thank you where is you know the the

1089
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Scott Brandner you know that</font>

1090
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:01,140
where's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff brothers yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

1091
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,160
it should make you know that thing what

1092
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:05,060
is that m

1093
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,620
you know that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all everybody refers to</font>

1094
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,790
of course it was like yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1095
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,080
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like cause like that's just</font>

1096
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:13,170
so boilerplate everybody just always

1097
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,670
sticks that in I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feel like you</font>

1098
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:18,960
know what you're talking about is at

1099
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:21,090
that level with you know um it may be

1100
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,580
something like that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1101
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:25,620
everyone would want to yeah use this

1102
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:34,890
this sort of threat model but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it may be</font>

1103
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:38,640
something No you answer all the question

1104
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:45,660
you had in the last slide uh oh no not

1105
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:48,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">really actually so yeah yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

1106
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:50,730
last one would be like if writing a new

1107
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,890
draft protocol and i'm pretty sure many

1108
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:55,260
people here trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that would you</font>

1109
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:57,299
follow something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font>

1110
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:04,890
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know can you guys do a show hands</font>

1111
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:07,320
like how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would well 30 yeah</font>

1112
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:09,870
that's it and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like the</font>

1113
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,970
question probably the most important one

1114
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:13,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it wouldn't fit here like which part</font>

1115
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it would it fit here would it feel</font>

1116
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:18,359
more inside which should i go back to

1117
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:21,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stephen because he sent me here so yeah</font>

1118
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,280
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking a do you owe ourselves we</font>

1119
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:25,109
can bring this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> P to the mailing list</font>

1120
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,330
when everyone is back<font color="#E5E5E5"> home I think it's</font>

1121
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:30,900
more time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the suggestion has been</font>

1122
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:32,069
made to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the model in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sag which I</font>

1123
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,650
would follow I mean every with that

1124
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:38,000
would propose at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah thank</font>

1125
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:38,000
you very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you mrs.</font>

1126
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Fernando</font>

i'll be presenting the document on

<font color="#E5E5E5">is essentially an ipv6 version of RFC</font>

1137
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:24,120
7126 what we had done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that document</font>

1138
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:27,000
was providing advice regarding the

1139
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,850
filtering of packets that the filtering

1140
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,620
of ipv4 packets with options so this

1141
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:34,549
document tries to do exactly the think

1142
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:37,049
the same thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ipv6 packets</font>

1143
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:40,680
obviously in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case talking about</font>

1144
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:44,940
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension headers and the</font>

1145
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:47,370
corresponding options in the ID

1146
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,650
essentially you find that we go through

1147
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:53,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">every single extension header every</font>

1148
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:55,350
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> option and we try to analyze what</font>

1149
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:57,360
are the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and operational</font>

1150
00:56:55,350 --> 00:57:00,509
implications of these extension headers

1151
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:03,150
and options what can go wrong if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1152
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:07,620
actually drop them and try to provide

1153
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:10,800
advice on that ah the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that based</font>

1154
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:14,009
on work that was done in other working

1155
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:17,400
groups like busy so basic shops we

1156
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:21,080
measure some extent of dropping of

1157
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:23,400
packets with extension headers and

1158
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:26,220
essentially the goal of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document is</font>

1159
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:30,440
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve that state of affairs</font>

1160
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:34,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is assuming that some notes are</font>

1161
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:36,570
filtering traffic or packets with

1162
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:39,720
extension headers as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of lack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1163
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:41,940
advice we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve that</font>

1164
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:47,430
situation by providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the correct</font>

1165
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:50,280
advice so what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this version</font>

1166
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:52,529
well first of all is like we kind of

1167
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:56,190
like he'll run out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and so we are</font>

1168
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:58,230
like back into the business of trying to

1169
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:58,500
you know give this one this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1170
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:02,850
last

1171
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:06,090
push to to progress and unpublished we

1172
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:08,700
ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up fixing meaner you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dieter</font>

1173
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:12,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">your problems filling up some sections</font>

1174
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:14,910
that were missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> content and I think I</font>

1175
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:16,800
particular particularly think that well

1176
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:21,779
this with a car instructor the document

1177
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:25,470
is kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> gun so some things that</font>

1178
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:27,930
we know we need to make progress in this

1179
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:30,930
based on other feedback or<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit ideas</font>

1180
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:34,680
that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with first one is</font>

1181
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:36,960
volunteers for reviewing so obviously we

1182
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,700
wrote the document and we like you know

1183
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,890
other people to take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

1184
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,379
document and tell us if there's stuff

1185
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:45,390
that is facing stuff that we should

1186
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:50,600
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your stuff that we just got wrong</font>

1187
00:58:45,390 --> 00:59:03,810
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can fix it so any volunteer</font>

1188
00:58:50,600 --> 00:59:07,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay ladies nany and myself and ideally</font>

1189
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:10,200
I guess that you know based on the you

1190
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:12,540
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> these reviews and there are no</font>

1191
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:15,089
let's say like big changes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1192
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:17,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure or or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the like I guess that it</font>

1193
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:21,330
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really to actually you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1194
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:22,710
do a working Joe Blasko I think I mean

1195
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:24,360
value it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a short document right his</font>

1196
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:28,370
face is 10 page or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

1197
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:32,700
right don't remember to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be honest um I</font>

1198
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:34,170
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember fella so my only command</font>

1199
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:38,790
to document<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty much like I</font>

1200
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:40,860
said talking about mine is the filtering

1201
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,900
whether you had transit provider or

1202
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:45,570
where the edge is different that's

1203
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:48,330
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea I think oh you</font>

1204
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:50,400
restrict the draft just for transit or

1205
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">inches fair I just say that I mean</font>

1206
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,750
besides<font color="#CCCCCC"> me thinking that what you're</font>

1207
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:58,319
saying is a good idea these document

1208
00:59:54,750 --> 01:00:02,220
tries to be lets say us hi Sheila say it

1209
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:05,760
US open as possible so<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably if it</font>

1210
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:07,859
was me I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be dropping much more</font>

1211
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,770
stuff that what he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking any sane</font>

1212
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:12,839
so this document is mostly like just

1213
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:15,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">blacklist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and like saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1214
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:17,788
is pocket you shouldn't let through like

1215
01:00:15,989 --> 01:00:21,180
let's say routing header type 0 for

1216
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:23,190
example but to the extender is possible

1217
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:25,379
these document advices you know to let

1218
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:30,479
everything through that begs the

1219
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:32,190
question of whether you know since the

1220
01:00:30,479 --> 01:00:36,089
current version you could say that is

1221
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:38,809
more aimed at you know transit that begs

1222
01:00:36,089 --> 01:00:42,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">the question whether we for the advice</font>

1223
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:43,920
we should like split it in two for

1224
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:46,019
example there are cases here where we

1225
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,759
say well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropping packets with this</font>

1226
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:50,669
extension together might break something

1227
01:00:47,759 --> 01:00:52,799
no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that is we allowed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to let</font>

1228
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:54,059
the packet through now there's the

1229
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:56,069
question of what you mentioned well

1230
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:58,200
where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing the filtering so if</font>

1231
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:01,410
you are in transit probably this advice

1232
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:04,229
is ok but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are more on the edge of</font>

1233
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:06,598
a network probably quite a few things

1234
01:01:04,229 --> 01:01:08,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">might change here I will be like more</font>

1235
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:13,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">prescriptive like saying well at least</font>

1236
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,430
you need this drop it so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

1237
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:21,719
let's say we should probably for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1238
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:24,839
advice on on on each extension header an

1239
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:27,989
option we should just<font color="#CCCCCC"> split the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advice</font>

1240
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:32,160
into for all of them or I'm open to that

1241
01:01:27,989 --> 01:01:35,099
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that is a good idea but uh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1242
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,529
opinion in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money yeah one</font>

1243
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:39,359
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean definitely I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

1244
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:43,469
speak from experience I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1245
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:47,009
operationally enterprises or domains

1246
01:01:43,469 --> 01:01:49,979
allow certain some things that you know

1247
01:01:47,009 --> 01:01:51,930
inside that they don't allow outside

1248
01:01:49,979 --> 01:01:54,058
that's definitely definitely true so

1249
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:54,989
that's that's something to consider but

1250
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:57,390
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you're kind of saying</font>

1251
01:01:54,989 --> 01:02:01,200
like I mean if an option is going out

1252
01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:03,150
and it's gonna break something I mean

1253
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,218
that's a real loose determination I mean

1254
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:08,219
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you sending the stupid thing if</font>

1255
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:10,619
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not for a purpose you know me so</font>

1256
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:13,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so obviously anything anything it</font>

1257
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:16,440
does is going to disable or you know

1258
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:20,190
means something's gonna not happen or

1259
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:21,869
happen for that thing is that well I'm

1260
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna make it what I was meaning what</font>

1261
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:25,440
I'm not sure if you're referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what</font>

1262
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:26,080
end when i said would break something

1263
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,510
yeah

1264
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:31,420
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is like if dropping a</font>

1265
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:34,420
packet well let's take the example of

1266
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:37,510
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worried right they are</font>

1267
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:39,400
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a routing header if a device were</font>

1268
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:41,590
to blow those packets well segment wrote

1269
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,690
in a break so if there is something that

1270
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:46,930
my break as a result of dropping we say

1271
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:48,400
not let this packet through we don't at

1272
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:51,430
least when it comes to this particular

1273
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:54,520
document it tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be as permissive as</font>

1274
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:56,680
possible so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you we recommend</font>

1275
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill the routing header type 0 but</font>

1276
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:01,270
let the other ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been</font>

1277
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:03,009
specified through no no I understand I

1278
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:09,250
understand what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying my point</font>

1279
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:14,050
is if you send an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's for a</font>

1280
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:16,060
purpose and if it doesn't do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1281
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:19,330
mean and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't if you drop it</font>

1282
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:21,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're gonna break or not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provide some</font>

1283
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:23,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of functionality otherwise why are</font>

1284
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:26,140
you even sending it I mean we don't send

1285
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:29,380
options just because we want to send

1286
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:32,350
options I mean I mine not<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but then</font>

1287
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:35,830
you so I mean depending on where you are

1288
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:38,380
doing the filtering so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say more in</font>

1289
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:40,360
the transit you have more of the idea to

1290
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:42,370
let everything through now when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1291
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,870
more on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge of an l word you say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1292
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know my traffic is not using any</font>

1293
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:48,850
options so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> should I let this packet</font>

1294
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:51,160
through so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of like what</font>

1295
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:53,230
you know Eric was saying so when you get

1296
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,720
more to the edge of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network it</font>

1297
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:58,420
becomes more of a white listing thing

1298
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:01,540
that you know what specific traffic you

1299
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:03,730
need so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allowed that traffic</font>

1300
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:06,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're asked when you go when you get</font>

1301
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:08,830
more to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transit network or you don't</font>

1302
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:11,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">really know what that traffic is meant</font>

1303
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">for so you are more permissive you could</font>

1304
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:16,420
say like since jen is in the queue as

1305
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:22,529
far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know google filters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all pockets</font>

1306
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">with extension headers which packets you</font>

1307
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:27,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">explicitly say that book broken</font>

1308
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:29,710
fragments will break Dina's so

1309
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:33,220
definitely and your document actually

1310
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:35,380
say do not block fragments<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 years so I</font>

1311
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:38,560
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very careful and</font>

1312
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:39,650
first of all actually my I was coming

1313
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,110
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

1314
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:44,660
I'm general heaven kind of problem with

1315
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:47,420
documents which start released in all

1316
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:48,830
existing possible option because it

1317
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:51,830
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sendin six months we're gonna</font>

1318
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:54,319
get another document which introduced

1319
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:57,350
another option<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this document i became</font>

1320
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:59,750
needs to be updated and so on yeah so I

1321
01:04:57,350 --> 01:05:02,060
actually do not think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to keep</font>

1322
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:05,990
producing more and more like document

1323
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:07,970
summarizing 25 has existing documents

1324
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:09,229
and keep update and it probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> need we</font>

1325
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,669
might need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a registry or</font>

1326
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:13,820
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably would be</font>

1327
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:15,920
a better idea but I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have the</font>

1328
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:19,070
registry which we have a registry for

1329
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,690
options and extension headers where do

1330
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:22,940
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the advice on what you do with</font>

1331
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:26,300
that header or option I actually think

1332
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:29,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should clearly</font>

1333
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:32,480
indicate what particular option is

1334
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:34,490
needed for and then let people<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide do</font>

1335
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,160
you need that particular feature or not

1336
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:42,020
instead of giving them advice blog or

1337
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:44,089
filter I<font color="#CCCCCC"> goguen so okay let's say I</font>

1338
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:45,860
don't I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm my network for</font>

1339
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:48,260
some reason do not use DNS right so i

1340
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:50,540
don't care if I'm breaking dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i</font>

1341
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:52,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">can feel i can filter fragments if i</font>

1342
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:54,860
know that i have dns and my network<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1343
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:57,410
might especially d in a sec right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1344
01:05:54,860 --> 01:06:00,320
might I want to appear me those Frank

1345
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:02,839
Lloyd and so on so I think all this

1346
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:05,870
extension headers should be in most

1347
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:08,660
cases treated like a protocol something

1348
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:10,580
like we have like any other protocol

1349
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:13,100
number and EDC protocol but the figure

1350
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:15,140
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not using that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular service</font>

1351
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:17,360
I can block it right if I use it I will

1352
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:19,490
permit that option it's I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

1353
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,200
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommendation we should get but</font>

1354
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:23,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing is that at times is not</font>

1355
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:26,660
straightforward what each extension

1356
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:29,270
header an option is used for which other

1357
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:32,000
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for example there was even I</font>

1358
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:34,400
think it was on 61 or v6 hoss people

1359
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,440
writing well you know there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1360
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,240
discussion about hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hopes for her</font>

1361
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,980
backup options yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were saying</font>

1362
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:44,209
what but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's one also</font>

1363
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:47,030
employed for Emily<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if we don't</font>

1364
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:48,710
know what it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is currently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

1365
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:50,510
for we should give recommendation on

1366
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:53,150
block indefinitely because we don't know

1367
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:54,260
if what people's<font color="#E5E5E5"> using for right no</font>

1368
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm saying is that if you have a</font>

1369
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:58,789
registry that<font color="#CCCCCC"> list let's say the</font>

1370
01:06:56,450 --> 01:07:01,399
extension headers and the options the

1371
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:03,500
guy that this that you know it's making

1372
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,020
the decision on<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether to drop that or</font>

1373
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:07,880
not at times cannot really say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

1374
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:10,160
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually using for providing</font>

1375
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,900
this and that other service that's what

1376
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,788
I'm saying so if you just provide the

1377
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:15,619
registry like saying option blah blah

1378
01:07:13,789 --> 01:07:17,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">blah the guy that has to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

1379
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:19,160
filtering says I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even know it's</font>

1380
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">not so I need it or not I'm yeah justin</font>

1381
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:23,930
is ricotta reference where it's defined

1382
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:27,289
to explicitly say which protocol I using

1383
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:29,390
and then I can look in this okay I'm I

1384
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:31,130
only need to permit particular

1385
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:32,450
destination option because it's used for

1386
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:34,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and I can block everything</font>

1387
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:36,589
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm what I'm saying is that at</font>

1388
01:07:34,819 --> 01:07:38,690
times that note that's not really

1389
01:07:36,589 --> 01:07:40,339
straightforward like you know I mean

1390
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:41,990
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the best example but we</font>

1391
01:07:40,339 --> 01:07:43,490
routed earlier if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go with the</font>

1392
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:46,669
register and say what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rudra learn</font>

1393
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:48,049
useful so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you can say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1394
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:49,970
your document but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could not save in</font>

1395
01:07:48,049 --> 01:07:51,770
any registry no no I'm what I'm saying

1396
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:53,839
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the registry doesn't say it</font>

1397
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:56,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it shouldn't say it it just says</font>

1398
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:58,819
this is the option that's it so option

1399
01:07:56,359 --> 01:08:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">blah blah this is the name this is where</font>

1400
01:07:58,819 --> 01:08:03,049
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> specified but we stuff like root</font>

1401
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:05,660
roller for example it can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1402
01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:07,700
many things so at times if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look</font>

1403
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the registry it's not strive forward</font>

1404
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:11,210
you what you might break if you drop

1405
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,589
packets containing that option and

1406
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:16,189
that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purposes of this</font>

1407
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:18,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">document yeah it will take it offline I</font>

1408
01:08:16,189 --> 01:08:19,908
think I cannot make myself clear and I

1409
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:21,858
in the comment i actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

1410
01:08:19,908 --> 01:08:27,068
introduction is kind of confusion

1411
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:29,600
because it sends it in extension headers

1412
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:31,909
could be used for d doors and other

1413
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,440
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> runnin processing software and</font>

1414
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:35,778
slower pass I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's always</font>

1415
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the case it might be case for hope I</font>

1416
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:39,859
hope and it's not actually necessary

1417
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:41,600
case for hope I hope it implementation

1418
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:43,489
depended so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should kind of</font>

1419
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,679
rephrase it to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it less negative</font>

1420
01:08:43,488 --> 01:08:49,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and probably again in terms of</font>

1421
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:50,810
format probably you could kind of

1422
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:53,689
provide it in the form of the table so

1423
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:55,759
it's easier to read yeah because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

1424
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:57,589
a administrator who has nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1425
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">all this stuff maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doc I just</font>

1426
01:08:57,589 --> 01:09:02,238
filter everything because it's very

1427
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:04,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">confusing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so basically i did a kind</font>

1428
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,638
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay put this registry in your</font>

1429
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:09,969
document they say here is the option

1430
01:09:06,639 --> 01:09:12,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">whew it's used for this if you block it</font>

1431
01:09:09,969 --> 01:09:14,229
it will break this and let administrator

1432
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:16,059
decide if I mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should probably</font>

1433
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:18,429
explicitly say if your transit provider

1434
01:09:16,059 --> 01:09:20,799
try not to block stuff right there and

1435
01:09:18,429 --> 01:09:24,429
the system to decide what to do is a

1436
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:26,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic so that's a question to you so</font>

1437
01:09:24,429 --> 01:09:30,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you are saying is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should</font>

1438
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:33,728
clearly states clearly state what breaks

1439
01:09:30,339 --> 01:09:35,799
but not recommend what to do yes because

1440
01:09:33,729 --> 01:09:39,130
I said if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> using particular service</font>

1441
01:09:35,799 --> 01:09:40,389
which go into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> broken okay unless</font>

01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:43,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">unless we know that this particular</font>

1443
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:46,630
option is is not used for anything

1444
01:09:43,029 --> 01:09:49,449
useful known to be harmful and should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1445
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:51,788
<font color="#CCCCCC">broke bro blocked then probably yes in</font>

1446
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:54,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">general how can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we tell people shall we</font>

1447
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:56,919
block or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I permit fragments if we don't</font>

1448
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,019
know it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a decision I mean</font>

1449
01:09:56,919 --> 01:10:01,030
actually for what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now in</font>

1450
01:09:59,019 --> 01:10:03,639
the document the stuff that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend</font>

1451
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:06,489
to filter is example routing header type

1452
01:10:03,639 --> 01:10:08,199
0 there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to discuss about that</font>

1453
01:10:06,489 --> 01:10:12,820
yeah but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sure that for most</font>

1454
01:10:08,199 --> 01:10:15,098
of the other options are it might be

1455
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:17,349
again decision based on the security

1456
01:10:15,099 --> 01:10:20,139
policy few security policies pyramid

1457
01:10:17,349 --> 01:10:22,090
only things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need and guac every</font>

1458
01:10:20,139 --> 01:10:23,919
channels they can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find out what</font>

1459
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:26,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">they need it might be that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

1460
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:28,570
policy is actually I'm only a broken arm

1461
01:10:26,349 --> 01:10:30,550
of harmful stuff and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> permit</font>

1462
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:32,409
everything else and then we should not

1463
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:34,449
recommend them to volcanism what does

1464
01:10:32,409 --> 01:10:36,759
kind of relates<font color="#E5E5E5"> world war Eric was</font>

1465
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:39,070
saying so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially what we have in</font>

1466
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:41,199
the document right now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly just</font>

1467
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:44,139
blacklisting stuff that is known to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1468
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:46,749
harmful we recommend to block the other

1469
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:48,489
stuff to let true but at the end of the

1470
01:10:46,749 --> 01:10:50,590
day I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that somehow you are</font>

1471
01:10:48,489 --> 01:10:52,058
agreeing with Eric which is it depends

1472
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:53,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">on you know where you are in the net</font>

1473
01:10:52,059 --> 01:10:59,829
were you might take one stance or the

1474
01:10:53,469 --> 01:11:04,090
other yeah living<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to see the</font>

1475
01:10:59,829 --> 01:11:06,398
history which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ayanna I mean I don't</font>

1476
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:09,189
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I on our role is to say or</font>

1477
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:10,749
even register a security use case so

1478
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:13,119
this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to go there</font>

01:11:10,749 --> 01:11:16,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">and east oh no use for short-term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

1480
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:18,848
sure that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did but to put her</font>

1481

very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange idea mm-hmm and to</font>

1485
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:33,080
come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point we want to say</font>

1486
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:35,360
something recommendation in your draft

1487
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:37,720
in your document because we want to say

1488
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,219
to isp that are blocking sanction errors

1489
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:42,950
please do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> do because the ATF has</font>

1490
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:45,830
agreed on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document right so I think</font>

1491
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:48,380
it's important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep it kind of open</font>

1492
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:51,050
there and to say and write

1493
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:53,960
recommendation so you're arguing

1494
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:56,390
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean just to to to see if</font>

1495
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,950
I read you clearly that we should

1496
01:11:56,390 --> 01:12:00,440
actually recommend something not just

1497
01:11:57,950 --> 01:12:06,230
leave the decision to up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the reader</font>

1498
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:12,710
right yeah i<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so a couple</font>

1499
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of thoughts okay bill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cerveny one is it</font>

1500
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:16,960
would be useful to have this information

1501
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:19,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine-readable so let's say a</font>

1502
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,660
firewall at some point in future could

1503
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:22,940
actually instead of having someone

1504
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:25,639
manually input all this information be

1505
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:26,990
able to access<font color="#CCCCCC"> it which would lean</font>

1506
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:31,370
towards having a recommendation whether

1507
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:36,469
or not um<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in a registry you could</font>

1508
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:37,580
deprecated some options and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll think</font>

1509
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:39,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the eye and a registry would say</font>

1510
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:40,490
yeah this is deprecated and perhaps some

1511
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:43,849
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine-readable could read</font>

1512
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:47,690
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had some experience with that</font>

1513
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:50,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay on at times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know deprecated and</font>

1514
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:52,549
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> input endpoint</font>

1515
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,230
identifier option was an option that was

1516
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:56,890
actually never used as far as i remember

1517
01:12:54,230 --> 01:13:00,669
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't even an RSC for it and</font>

1518
01:12:56,890 --> 01:13:05,030
trying to formally duplicate that up

1519
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:06,710
lots of energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not saying that</font>

1520
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:09,710
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way to go I when I'm</font>

1521
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:12,800
saying is that at times it's extremely

1522
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:14,540
hard not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because he</font>

1523
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,700
obviously is not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just email</font>

1524
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:19,160
ayana and they say okay yeah we market

1525
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:22,700
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is IDF action that is required</font>

1526
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:24,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that and I'm not saying it shouldn't</font>

1527
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:28,010
be done actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think that</font>

1528
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:30,320
for some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we have like you know</font>

1529
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:30,760
what we were working on the options we

1530
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,860
had

1531
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:35,689
a document as actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we never</font>

1532
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:37,209
published and it was like done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1533
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:41,090
been my computer for like two years

1534
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:43,760
because we were finding options or that

1535
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:45,769
had no information at all so at the time

1536
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,959
they were given the option number was

1537
01:13:45,769 --> 01:13:50,809
given to someone there was no

1538
01:13:47,959 --> 01:13:52,938
specification so we were doing the work

1539
01:13:50,809 --> 01:13:54,349
of trying to you know find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1540
01:13:52,939 --> 01:13:56,179
that were reference it there because

1541
01:13:54,349 --> 01:13:58,610
obviously the email addresses were not

1542
01:13:56,179 --> 01:14:02,959
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people you</font>

1543
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:05,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't find and for some of them we</font>

1544
01:14:02,959 --> 01:14:07,130
actually get to talk to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors at</font>

1545
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:09,860
the time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they say yeah yeah this was</font>

1546
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:12,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">never used so we started to work on a</font>

1547
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:14,239
document which not you you know it kind

1548
01:14:12,499 --> 01:14:16,820
of like rises so I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to rebuy</font>

1549
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:19,098
that or post it whatever I have in on my

1550
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:21,709
computer trying to actually those are

1551
01:14:19,099 --> 01:14:26,389
have never been used<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chuck to try to</font>

1552
01:14:21,709 --> 01:14:28,159
formally deprecated them<font color="#E5E5E5"> now getting in</font>

1553
01:14:26,389 --> 01:14:30,530
contact with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> authors I mean these</font>

1554
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:32,869
was in some cases this was a long long

1555
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:35,268
time ago but there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now</font>

1556
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:37,188
work even in different fields this is

1557
01:14:35,269 --> 01:14:39,739
like the experience that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had and but</font>

1558
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:42,019
even then when you get you know to to do

1559
01:14:39,739 --> 01:14:44,598
the theory that is required to deprecate

1560
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:46,639
this at times it requires a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1561
01:14:44,599 --> 01:14:48,260
energy to you know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to be</font>

1562
01:14:46,639 --> 01:14:50,449
published<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the options to be</font>

1563
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:53,150
deprecated is there a value to have

1564
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:54,348
let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead say deprecated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1565
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:57,259
know where you really really want Jeff

1566
01:14:54,349 --> 01:14:59,679
kids maybe say unknown say yeah just

1567
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:02,209
someone put this error we don't know

1568
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:04,489
what it does and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want you could</font>

1569
01:15:02,209 --> 01:15:06,530
let the sewer or not well but the thing

1570
01:15:04,489 --> 01:15:08,900
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were when we were you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1571
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:12,139
walking on the on the car like the same

1572
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:13,789
document but for ipv4 years ago the

1573
01:15:12,139 --> 01:15:16,969
sentiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like well if you don't</font>

1574
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:19,009
know you cannot provide advice yeah so

1575
01:15:16,969 --> 01:15:21,019
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like well before you actually say</font>

1576
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:22,760
do this or that you have to be able to

1577
01:15:21,019 --> 01:15:25,400
tell what's that and if it's used for

1578
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:27,380
anything so that's why we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing we</font>

1579
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,789
did that for the ipv4 document to like

1580
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:31,939
you know trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find like you know</font>

1581
01:15:28,789 --> 01:15:33,800
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> like linkedin google to try to</font>

1582
01:15:31,939 --> 01:15:35,179
find where these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were still alive</font>

1583
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:39,199
and you know where they were still

1584
01:15:35,179 --> 01:15:41,090
ritual for many cases we were able to to

1585
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:43,249
do that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to look at them</font>

1586
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:44,420
because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were for</font>

1587
01:15:43,249 --> 01:15:46,940
those options that you

1588
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:49,850
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clear references we were</font>

1589
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:51,620
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know try to get ahold of the authors</font>

1590
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:52,910
and trying to ask them you know whether

1591
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:55,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sore know we never</font>

1592
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:57,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">published the document I mean we we did</font>

1593
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:59,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it like two years ago we never publish</font>

1594
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:02,480
it but i will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look because I it's</font>

1595
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:05,750
probably my computer still<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um yeah</font>

1596
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:07,160
I I mean the scenario I think of is

1597
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:10,040
let's say someone develops something new

1598
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:13,429
that uses I newport or a new extension

1599
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:15,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">header option or whatever if you publish</font>

1600
01:16:13,429 --> 01:16:17,150
just let's say tomorrow is this thing in

1601
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:20,300
six months probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see like</font>

1602
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:22,070
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of years before the</font>

1603
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:23,330
firewall header will or firewall people

1604
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:25,940
will actually update their information

1605
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:28,370
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something in place that's</font>

1606
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:30,199
machine readable and or some way of

1607
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:32,390
updating this information let's say a

1608
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:35,690
new RC a year from now that somehow

1609
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:38,690
someone could reference that would oh I

1610
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:40,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it would it provides security but</font>

1611
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:44,000
you'd also allow for future developments

1612
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:45,500
well in the short term with the document

1613
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have right now what we have</font>

1614
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:50,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now it is very permissive it even</font>

1615
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:52,429
says that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you don't have to it</font>

1616
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:56,120
follows the I kind of like follows the

1617
01:16:52,429 --> 01:16:58,190
advice in RSC 7045 which is you

1618
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:02,030
shouldn't like say I blow a block

1619
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:04,549
unknown options unknown eh but that's

1620
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:06,920
again because it this is mostly targeted

1621
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:09,980
more in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the network so</font>

1622
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:12,080
probably you know the best way to

1623
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,968
possibly answer that is go with area

1624
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,380
that eric said because depending on

1625
01:17:13,969 --> 01:17:16,640
where you are doing the filtering you

1626
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:18,530
might want to do one thing or the other

1627
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,510
if you are more in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of the</font>

1628
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:22,099
network be more permissive but if you

1629
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:28,460
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the edge is probably more of a</font>

1630
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:30,590
white violet whitelist approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I'm</font>

1631
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:32,989
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> following up on some stuff that</font>

1632
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:35,540
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of been skirting</font>

1633
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:38,059
around I think billing and and Jen we're

1634
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:39,650
kind of talking about to and it this

1635
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:42,260
whole thing in some ways has a lot of

1636
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:46,120
similarities to the thing of maria's

1637
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:49,520
there's a class of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems and</font>

1638
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:54,440
information which actually belongs in

1639
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:57,480
some type of table that and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1640
01:17:54,440 --> 01:18:00,690
a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mandate you know what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

1641
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:02,219
like like like my destination option

1642
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:04,259
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to be past is not in</font>

1643
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:06,840
there so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it has to be part of</font>

1644
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:08,790
the procedure that if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this like</font>

1645
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,400
yeah there's an you go to I Anna and

1646
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:13,590
then you update the though you know

1647
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:16,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever you you call the the</font>

1648
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:18,660
recommendations table and so then it's

1649
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:21,330
like it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be there and</font>

1650
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:22,400
like in the IP p.m. registry I mean

1651
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:25,500
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been going through all this</font>

1652
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:27,179
endless chaos about machine readable and

1653
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,920
you know what are all the fields in

1654
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:31,320
there I mean it's been a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

1655
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,910
endless but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is and it's going to</font>

1656
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:35,519
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Anna maintained and there's a whole</font>

1657
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:37,830
registry for what the metrics are what

1658
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,520
they mean blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

1659
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:44,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a good thing to do it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1660
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:47,430
unless you develop some subsidiary

1661
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:52,710
procedures both in terms of readability

1662
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:54,450
and maintainability<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it and and</font>

1663
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:56,070
those are both really good things for

1664
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:58,110
both you guys that's it's great

1665
01:18:56,070 --> 01:19:01,769
information I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1666
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:03,269
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like 14 dhcpv6 options or you</font>

1667
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:06,870
know there's there's a class of

1668
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:10,260
information which fits into this kind of

1669
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:13,170
thing am I making any sense to you I'm

1670
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:15,270
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I follow what your</font>

1671
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:18,690
recommendation here so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1672
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:21,360
you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep a registry of what</font>

1673
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:25,169
well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm suggesting i think is</font>

1674
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:27,239
three things one you have a set of

1675
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:30,150
recommendations that are more generic

1676
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:31,950
like if you understand it pass it you

1677
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:34,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">know talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different domains</font>

1678
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:37,340
topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that ends up yeah great</font>

1679
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:40,890
then there's something there's absolute

1680
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:43,920
information about there's this kind of

1681
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:45,960
header and then these options underneath

1682
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:48,180
there it's this this this and this you

1683
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:50,520
should pass this don't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> etc I</font>

1684
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:51,780
mean right so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's two</font>

1685
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:54,920
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of information in that</font>

1686
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:57,179
draft so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially yes the a</font>

1687
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,700
discussion of the extension Heather's

1688
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:01,170
themselves on the options too yeah yeah

1689
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:04,290
so but I mean there's like theirs theirs

1690
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:06,000
in intro like if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand it</font>

1691
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:08,040
I mean what I'm saying is maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1692
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,719
the sin so what we do I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> even when</font>

1693
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,110
it comes today whether you understand

1694
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:13,869
the option on the hair it so

1695
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:17,799
we replicate essentially what what's in

1696
01:20:13,869 --> 01:20:20,080
RFC 7045 so if it's unknown you should

1697
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:23,110
pass it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shouldn't block options that</font>

1698
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:25,719
are unknown etc etc what we say if for

1699
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:28,150
those that are specified we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

1700
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay try to summarize what that optional</font>

1701
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:32,619
effect or extension header is useful so

1702
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:35,020
that ok you phone in the registry this

1703
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:36,610

1705
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:40,449

1706
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:42,250
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more information that what you have</font>

1707
01:20:40,449 --> 01:20:43,719
in the registry in the registry you just

1708
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:44,949
point to the specification<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the times</font>

1709
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:47,590
it doesn't tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is actually</font>

1714
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:58,630
this well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what would break</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

01:20:56,830 --> 01:21:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it comes to security implications</font>

1716

1718
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:07,030

maintainability of the document might

1724
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:28,960
want to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit different it</font>

1725
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:31,030
might want to not be an RFC and I mean I

1726
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:36,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is but some</font>

1727
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:40,659
maintainable document similar to Marius

1728
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:46,020
is threat table because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1729
01:21:40,659 --> 01:21:51,219
modified much more regularly than one

expects a draft to be it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also requires</font>

1731
01:21:51,219 --> 01:21:59,920
that anybody I think it should require

1732
01:21:55,389 --> 01:22:03,159
that anybody who puts in a new option

1733
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,900
there is a procedure or you know it's

1734
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:06,820
like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to put in there like what</font>

1735
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:09,009
are the security sections like what what

1736
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:10,929
are ionic considerations they should

1737
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:13,570
either have to notify you or the

1738
01:22:10,929 --> 01:22:16,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Secretariat or whoever so that you can</font>

1739
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:19,659
add this<font color="#E5E5E5"> new destination options its</font>

1740
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:21,070
implications etc into that does that

1741
01:22:19,659 --> 01:22:23,290
does that make you know one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

1742
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:24,790
believe it's important which is you know

1743
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:27,340
at the end of the day

1744
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:30,670
the goal of this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to try to</font>

1745
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:32,470
improve the state of affairs to what is

1746
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:36,070
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on nowadays with extension headers</font>

1747
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:38,350
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> besides these specific details what</font>

1748
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:40,690
we try what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying here is that</font>

1749
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:43,420
for those cases where you know networks

1750
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:45,429
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropping packets which we wouldn't</font>

1751
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:47,650
want them to be dropping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

1752
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:49,390
provide advice to that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1753
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:52,030
document is meant to you know like at

1754
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:54,580
the you know the minute level whenever

1755
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:56,950
something new and goes on ok now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

1756
01:22:54,580 --> 01:23:00,040
that take your policies but at least to

1757
01:22:56,950 --> 01:23:02,050
what we have right now which the level

1758
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:04,920
of pocket drops that we have try to

1759
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:07,960
improve that I mean even<font color="#CCCCCC"> with I</font>

1760
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:10,990
personally think that if with the stuff

1761
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:13,720
that is specified so far we were able to

1762
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:15,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">reduce the level of dropping with this</font>

1763
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:17,380
document for me that's a big goal and I

1764
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,240
you'd be done with it I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1765
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:22,900
from my perspective the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main goal here</font>

1766
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok ok so so if it's outdated in six</font>

1767
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:27,549
months then you're you're good with that

1768
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:29,800
or or you're good with updating it every

1769
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:31,510
single for me the worst part I mean it's

1770
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">not that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something that</font>

1771
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:35,680
is nice but what I'm saying is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1772
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:37,839
have nowadays a bigger problem which is

1773
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:40,540
that stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been specified a</font>

1774
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:43,000
long time ago still being dropped and

1775
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:45,190
thus I think the main part that we want

1776
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change many of us it's like when we</font>

1777
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:48,070
measure stuff that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it has</font>

1778
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:51,220
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> polished like six months from now</font>

1779
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:53,559
but ages ago that's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong if we</font>

1780
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't reduce the level of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pockets</font>

1781
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:57,220
rod particularly the ones that are

1782
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:59,410
happening in transit which are I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

1783
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:01,450
the ones that we are mostly concerned I

1784
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can get that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1785
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:05,710
reduced that's I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as far as</font>

1786
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,809
I'm concerned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal has been</font>

1787
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:09,580
achieved yeah that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean maybe</font>

1788
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:11,680
somebody else can pick up your work and

1789
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:12,970
do more later yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if there's</font>

1790
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:21,070
eventually something that they want to

1791
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:23,580
keep it more<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to date that's fine so</font>

1792
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:26,440
to come back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole history issue</font>

1793
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:28,840
the more thing and the interaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1794
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:31,299
sensible questions from the linnean and

1795
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wonder whether you should not</font>

1796
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:37,369
restrict your document just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for transit</font>

1797
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:40,189
providers so basically the black

1798
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:42,679
approach and the other issue with the

1799
01:24:40,189 --> 01:24:44,689
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> history is that I'm pretty sure</font>

1800
01:24:42,679 --> 01:24:48,349
that the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> who design the hub biopic</font>

1801
01:24:44,689 --> 01:24:50,840
senators in 95 was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the</font>

1802
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:52,189
hardware router coming which is only

1803
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:56,030
issue when you don't process it again

1804
01:24:52,189 --> 01:24:58,639
CPU and the guy rotting in 95 the

1805
01:24:56,030 --> 01:25:01,789
routing at at time<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero was not thinking</font>

1806
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:04,639
about the attack so those meaning it's

1807
01:25:01,789 --> 01:25:07,459
no point of putting in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> virgin when you</font>

1808
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:09,379
design a protocol to say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1809
01:25:07,459 --> 01:25:11,898
dangerous because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you don't</font>

1810
01:25:09,379 --> 01:25:13,369
design a protocol that's dangerous so

1811
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:16,369
what you say maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should at least</font>

1812
01:25:13,369 --> 01:25:20,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so what you're saying is that we</font>

1813
01:25:16,369 --> 01:25:22,188
<font color="#E5E5E5">shouldn't just split their</font>

1814
01:25:20,179 --> 01:25:24,739
recommendations into transient an edge

1815
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:26,719
essentially just take the transit and it

1816
01:25:24,739 --> 01:25:29,449
will be clear for everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and it</font>

1817
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:32,209
would also prevent operators to be

1818
01:25:29,449 --> 01:25:36,739
scared and miss read the draft okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1819
01:25:32,209 --> 01:25:39,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> document yeah Julie ipv4 source</font>

1820
01:25:36,739 --> 01:25:42,079
routing was still a thing in 94 so I

1821
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:46,869
mean you know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of bad ideas</font>

1822
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:46,869
then kind of dispensed of since then I

1823
01:25:48,249 --> 01:25:57,619
think you're right so um yes limbering

1824
01:25:53,749 --> 01:26:00,228
house and you just suggested to get the

1825
01:25:57,619 --> 01:26:02,239
edge part out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this document but just</font>

1826
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:04,639
the firewall administrators at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> edge</font>

1827
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:06,199
are the ones who need guidance the

1828
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:08,090
service providers will eventually let

1829
01:26:06,199 --> 01:26:10,369
all the stuff through because this stuff

1830
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:12,469
belongs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the customers so they will</font>

1831
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:14,478
open their firewalls eventually but the

1832
01:26:12,469 --> 01:26:17,329
customers at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprises</font>

1833
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:19,519
who now try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy ipv6 they fear</font>

1834
01:26:17,329 --> 01:26:22,099
ipv6 because they have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea how to</font>

1835
01:26:19,519 --> 01:26:23,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement it what they can do what all</font>

1836
01:26:22,099 --> 01:26:25,519
these headers do to them so the section

1837
01:26:23,869 --> 01:26:28,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the use case this is very very</font>

1838
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:31,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show them what they can use</font>

1839
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:33,320
this stuff for but if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> em</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1840
01:26:31,309 --> 01:26:35,929
enterprise section the edge attention

1841
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:38,268
out and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who need</font>

1842
01:26:35,929 --> 01:26:41,539
guidance most get nothing out of this

1843
01:26:38,269 --> 01:26:43,459
document and we ipv6 is deployed at the

1844
01:26:41,539 --> 01:26:45,920
edge today the service providers all

1845
01:26:43,459 --> 01:26:48,469
have it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> short have it</font>

1846
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:53,120
so I see your point so i guess that

1847
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:54,920
question here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i see your point</font>

1848
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,660
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know that</font>

1849
01:26:54,920 --> 01:27:00,469
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be valuable what I'm</font>

1850
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:02,570
personally wondering myself is if we

1851
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:05,270
make the document focus on transit I

1852
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:09,049
think we are like essentially almost

1853
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:12,140
done right and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> document as it is</font>

1854
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:14,570
without the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge stuff would help</font>

1855
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:16,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully to you know improve the</font>

1856
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:18,799
situation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the level of drop in that</font>

1857
01:27:16,969 --> 01:27:21,679
we have in transit so I guess that<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

1858
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:25,130
options are one of them we split<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1859
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:27,230
recommendations in this one I see in

1860
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:29,690
that case people come in and saying oh

1861
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:31,459
but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the whitelist</font>

1862
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:33,620
approach then if something gets

1863
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:35,780
publisher there will be like a delta

1864
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:38,360
there during which the time will that

1865
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:41,090
stuff will be dropped so one option is

1866
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:43,070
to you know split the recommendations as

1867
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:45,080
we were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and we have for</font>

1868
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:47,259
transient at the edge the other one is

1869
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:49,900
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in two separate documents</font>

1870
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:52,610
having this one publish a city's

1871
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:55,610
targeting or having the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gold</font>

1872
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:58,070
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we reduce</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the level of</font>

1873
01:27:55,610 --> 01:28:00,410
packet drops in transit and having a

1874
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:02,960
separate one that just targets you know

1875
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:04,940
at the edge and to some extent that

1876
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,410
might make sense since that sense that

1877
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:07,910
probably the guy that is configuring the

1878
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:09,949
firewall at the edge doesn't care about

1879
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:13,940
what the guy at doing in transit is

1880
01:28:09,949 --> 01:28:16,190
doing unbiased<font color="#E5E5E5"> versa so I'm open to you</font>

1881
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:20,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I mean any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the two options who</font>

1882
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:23,389
would work for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am just dumb so I</font>

1883
01:28:20,929 --> 01:28:25,130
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just listening to like old feet back</font>

1884
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:28,400
and what you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying repeating over</font>

1885
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:29,840
and over again and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the</font>

1886
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:32,809
only question that didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get us</font>

1887
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:35,750
theaters who you actually expect to read

1888
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:38,929
this document so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go back like</font>

1889
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:41,810
Williams no comments is what you

1890
01:28:38,929 --> 01:28:44,690
actually want is you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> publish the</font>

1891
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:46,790
template and say hey here is a cisco

1892
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:48,589
template you maybe don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he</font>

1893
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:50,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nessus and you maybe don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1894
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:53,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">does and you know nothing about AP v6</font>

1895
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:55,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">and extension address but take this</font>

1896
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:56,870
template put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your cisco router</font>

1897
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:59,750
you're tuning<font color="#E5E5E5"> pirata your check on 501</font>

1898
01:28:56,870 --> 01:29:02,900
and your facebook will work and you

1899
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:05,690
reasonably secure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess if you</font>

1900
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:08,660
really care about this and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1901
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:11,570
care about enterprises or transit

1902
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:14,000
cousins whatever you probably having

1903
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:16,280
better results by just giving people

1904
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,970
like these secure config templates on a

1905
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:21,650
block or in a book then actually right

1906
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:23,150
in our see that these people had

1907
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:26,120
probably needed the most likely not

1908
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:28,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to read anyway I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd be kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1909
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:31,370
like quite suspicious about someone that

1910
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:34,370
will just copy and paste wherever I put

1911
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:36,830
in a template so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I don't know</font>

1912
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:38,650
what my specific target is but certainly

1913
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:41,630
my target it's someone that will read

1914
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:44,059
understand what i wrote and then act

1915
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:45,590
accordingly if there's a guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

1916
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:49,370
just copy and paste whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

1917
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:51,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that guy to read my document but</font>

1918
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:55,430
that's essentially what's going to

1919
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:57,650
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay lost mine because rid of</font>

1920
01:29:55,430 --> 01:30:02,300
almost in overtime actually we are in

1921
01:29:57,650 --> 01:30:05,599
over time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is so</font>

1922
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:08,720
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> many questions here is whether we</font>

1923
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,420
stick with what do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially</font>

1924
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:13,400
target this document that transit and

1925
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:15,650
publish assess and when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1926
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:18,410
edge stuff we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually we see what</font>

1927
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:20,360
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the other is whether we split the</font>

1928
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:21,889
recommendations into<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> given the</font>

1929
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:23,839
discussion I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> stick today what</font>

1930
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:26,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last start I said like target the</font>

1931
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:29,330
transit a<font color="#CCCCCC"> MIDI not reducing the level of</font>

1932
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:32,750
drops that's my take yeah I agree I've

1933
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:35,840
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it on the list anyway go I'm</font>

1934
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:41,630
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's time to finish</font>

1935
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:46,400
I have only one blue sheet the other one

1936
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:49,010
is ok everyone sign it so if not come

1937
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:52,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">back inside here and thing is a great</font>

1938
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:52,180
time thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for coming</font>

1939
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,660
you
