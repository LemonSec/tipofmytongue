00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:39,170
collection of other<font color="#E5E5E5"> events around the</font>

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,730
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some interrupt events by</font>

18
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,250
etsy research workshop by the I RTF and

19
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,690
so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the ITF also I mean it's</font>

20
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,800
not just about specifications and

21
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,470
working group meetings we were also

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,930
about running code of course so we've

23
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,690
been working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that this time we had</font>

24
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:59,480
150 plus people working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that on over</font>

25
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,218
20 different projects and some some very

26
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,839
interesting ones that had you know big

27
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,329
significance<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as an</font>

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,939
example we worked on TLS 1.3

29
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:09,770
implementations had interrupt testing of

30
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:11,449
seven of those implementations against

31
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,950
each other in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful manner and</font>

32
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,979
that's a that's a protocol that's

33
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,229
underneath https you know the web

34
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:20,658
security protocol so it's it's quite

35
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:22,039
important yeah I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one of the</font>

36
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:23,749
judges in the hackathon and it was

37
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:26,149
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing to sit there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and see the</font>

38
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:28,009
breadth of topics covered by the IETF

39
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:30,200
and to be reminded<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and seeing</font>

40
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,609
all that that open code well speaking of

41
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,979
those topics<font color="#CCCCCC"> what were some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the main</font>

42
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:36,770
topics you thought had a lot of activity

43
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:38,270
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> at ITF 96-well many things of</font>

44
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,459
course but the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was highlight</font>

45
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,529
for me at least was the the evolution of

46
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:44,020
the transport and web protocols and and

47
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:46,219
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> weekend we had the most</font>

48
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,429
well-attended meeting that the quick

49
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:51,649
protocol both which is a discussion of

50
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:54,109
possible new new work at the ITF and

51
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,669
this is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a redesign of that</font>

52
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:58,759
some of the basic protocols in the

53
00:01:55,669 --> 00:02:02,658
internet like<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp and how you know how</font>

54
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,939
web traffic is transported and that has

55
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,249
a big impact if it goes forward so that

56
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,810
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for lots of</font>

57
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:11,900
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and of course we had many other</font>

58
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,410
topics security IOT we even had a

59
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,640
discussion about blockchain and

60
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,109
as kinds of payment systems or

61
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,480
interoperability between different

62
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,730
payment systems so I good good variety

63
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,959
of topics yeah there's a there's a kind

64
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">of meeting here called the birds of a</font>
