formerly described monolith of quick and

60
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,709
break it in two appropriately sized

61
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,110
building blocks and associate those with

62
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,370
work here in the ITF so some of the

63
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen in</font>

broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> into individual drafts so that</font>

66
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,828
it's a reusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF technologies better</font>

67
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:54,140
and more reusable by ITF technologies

68
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:55,610
better it is a UDP oh look I'm

90
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:55,229
sessions good so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people in</font>

91
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,389
the group are aware of that work

92
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,370
hopefully I think it's important for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

93
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:03,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">because as he said you know one of the</font>

94
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,860
core targets is for HTTPS and we want to

95
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,629
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that that's a graceful</font>

96
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,759
transition I have a new protocol a new

97
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,979
mapping of HTTP semantics to a wire

98
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:16,580
protocol we need to as a community here

99
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:19,349
keep an eye on that so moving on

100
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,930
specification status we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two specs</font>

101
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:24,300
that are nearing the end of our work on

102
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,849
them hopefully one is the HTTP

103
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,589
encryption content<font color="#CCCCCC"> encoding we had a</font>

104
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group last call on that that</font>

105
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:34,949
ended just a little while ago and we had

106
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,860
a some feedback on it in working group

107
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:40,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">last call I think you know with my chair</font>

108
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,610
head on I'm I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a little</font>

109
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,889
more discussion of it it seems like

110
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,990
there's not yet been broad discussion

111
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,000
but the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have reviewed it</font>

112
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,699
seemed fairly happy we did get some

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,409
feedback from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ecker more recently after</font>

114
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,779
the working group class called closed on

115
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:57,060
list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think he wanted to open</font>

116
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,219
up some more discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

117
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,139
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my standpoint I'm happy to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

118
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:03,330
this and let that discussion take place

119
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,699
before we go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ally TF last call i'm</font>

120
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,399
happy for it to happen in ITF last call

121
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:18,389
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ecker did you want to kind of expand</font>

122
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:23,189
upon the concerns that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had sure see</font>

123
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:25,110
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it by memory um so I mean</font>

124
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:27,689
when this was initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed it was</font>

125
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,180
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of it was pitched as a</font>

126
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:33,629
simple mechanism that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> without the</font>

127
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,159
all the clutter as background the IETF

128
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,839
has made a number of attempts over the

129
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:39,750
years of designing secure messaging

130
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,210
protocols of<font color="#CCCCCC"> phrase cuts um on this</font>

131
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,410
protocol

132
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,239
simply come with some form of a key

133
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,990
exchange k establishment and they come

134
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,220
with a a framing layer for the data and

135
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they come with an integrity check</font>

136
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,960
and um so this was framed as being like

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,819
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to take out all that</font>

138
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,109
baggage of s<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine or jose or whatever</font>

139
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,880
and we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it all in</font>

140
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,569
one in one nice little package you only

141
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:05,319
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we need and over the um you</font>

142
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:07,330
know as many standards do over the over

143
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:11,250
the pipe lifetime in<font color="#CCCCCC"> sarah's element is</font>

144
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:13,389
blown it on and it's now picked up<font color="#CCCCCC"> um a</font>

145
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,479
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of features which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not sure</font>

146
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:18,340
really needed um and conversely<font color="#E5E5E5"> has this</font>

147
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,860
extremely odd attitude that the only

148
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,710
symmetric algorithm supports is aes GCM

149
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:27,130
while simultaneously supporting like you

150
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:30,008
know um both out-of-band authentication

151
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,409
and an integrity integrity and

152
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:35,020
confidentiality keys + look the coalesce

153
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:39,190
finite field to heaven and as an odd the

154
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:44,109
set of design choices thank you but no

155
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:46,389
um not gonna happen that's a nod to the

156
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,479
design choices and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think would be</font>

157
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:51,130
worth asking the question of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

158
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">right set of design choices and what are</font>

159
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:58,990
the actual use cases and should this be

160
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,669
slimmed down or fattened up um and if we

161
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,110
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need something this fat maybe we</font>

162
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:03,520
actually don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything at all but</font>

163
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:10,060
rather just deal with the old things was

164
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:13,630
already nice and fat yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> thomson</font>

165
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:16,930
having read your email and had<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

166
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:20,020
little time to think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> um there is a</font>

167
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,509
possibility here of maybe refactoring

168
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,210
these sorts of things the the primary

169
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:27,639
complex parts of this are only<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

170
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,650
used by the web push stuff and it may be

171
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,120
that we can sort of take those pieces

172
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,630
out and sort of shove them over there

173
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,339
and deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and keep this the</font>

174
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,309
relatively slim down thing that it was

175
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:42,159
originally which i think might go a long

176
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:44,529
way to addressing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on your points on</font>

177
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,209
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DA stuff here that removes all that</font>

178
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:49,360
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they have a very narrow</font>

179
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:52,349
profile so so web bush has a very narrow

180
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,350
profile as well

181
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,640
that we could then just use directly and

182
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,350
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get rid of all the baggage that</font>

183
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,530
you have around diffie-hellman groups

184
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,890
and analysis of other things so let's

185
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:07,800
talk about doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I can have a I can</font>

186
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,270
have a color that if necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font>

187
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,790
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think a little bit more about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

188
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,840
obviously but I do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

189
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,640
best of my knowledge there's nothing

190
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,860
actually unsound about this document I

191
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not sure it's the right set</font>

192
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,850
collection of each month you know from

193
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,350
my standpoint I'd like to see some more

194
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,180
review and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether</font>

195
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's best to get that in in the working</font>

196
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,410
group or in ITF last call it sounds like

197
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,910
we might benefit from bringing it back

198
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,579
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group for one more round I</font>

199
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,350
guess the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> though they're at this is</font>

200
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,400
it is now gone to the point where it's

201
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,330
not obvious to me it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct um um</font>

202
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,939
not that it's bad but I'm just saying

203
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,790
like there's enough pieces now involved

204
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,440
that I not sure i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not sure i</font>

205
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:50,130
demonstrate this correct route some more

206
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,420
work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done and the original</font>

207
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">version i thought was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like was</font>

208
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,630
relatively obviously correct but um

209
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:00,180
maybe it wasn't but it seemed obvious it

210
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:01,860
was ok so let's have if this weekend

211
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,160
over the next couple of weeks do you

212
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:08,070
have time to iterate on that work with

213
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ecker get a new draft out we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss</font>

214
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and probably go back to working group</font>

215
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:17,750
last call<font color="#CCCCCC"> do another wgl see is that</font>

216
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,750
going to cause issues for web push I

217
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,569
don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people think about</font>

218
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:27,840
my my view is that people are doing web

219
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,100
push and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do this right it won't</font>

220
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually change any of the bits on the</font>

221
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,260
way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those guys then there's a large</font>

222
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,729
number of implementations web push and

223
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,410
that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that we've got to be a</font>

224
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,730
bit sensitive to and they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

225
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:43,650
already and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using this already</font>

226
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:45,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose working</font>

227
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,250
group stay tuned and and when we get

228
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that next draft out it would be great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

229
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:54,120
get a few more eyeballs on it to the

230
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:56,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">other one is opportunistic security and</font>

231
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,810
I believe with that draft we're just

232
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,700
waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a revised internet draft</font>

233
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,800
before taking it to ITF last call I

234
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,420
think we've addressed all the issues

235
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:09,479
that came up in last call of from memory

236
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,579
Mike<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bishop is the Shepherd for that doc</font>

237
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,160
is Mike in there there is is that is

238
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:17,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you see as being at as well</font>

239
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,920
okay mike says yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect maybe</font>

240
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,800
even this week a new ID for that which

241
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:30,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">will then take to ITF LC and then</font>

242
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:33,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully get that that duck done so</font>

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,250
let's move on again um the drafts that

244
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,510
we currently have active are listed here

245
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:41,220
so let's start with RFC 59 87 bits which

246
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,670
Julian tells me we do have some

247
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:48,230
something to talk about if I can get

248
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,229
this to let's see

249
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:12,378
Julian hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> how's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this work hello hello</font>

250
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:20,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit closer maybe no but your ads</font>

251
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:25,999
editing box<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please so</font>

252
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:30,738
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to put non-ascii</font>

253
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:34,249
characters into parameter values in HTTP

254
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:36,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">header fields that was invented a very</font>

255
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:41,629
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago four main header fields</font>

256
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:45,498
that I provide for huge for use in HTTP

257
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:49,220
in 2010 because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

258
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:52,879
implemented in some browsers and after

259
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,669
the work of writing down that standard

260
00:12:52,879 --> 00:13:00,980
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end the browsers that hadn't</font>

261
00:12:55,669 --> 00:13:05,829
implemented it it yet did so so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

262
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,829
now widely deployed and interoperable um

263
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:16,100
next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

264
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:21,079
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I made compared to the proposed</font>

265
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:24,980
standard proposed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Madrid one of which</font>

266
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:28,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">was in the original spec we required</font>

267
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:32,689
support for balls utf-8 and iso 8859

268
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:36,619
minus 1 because that's what's existing

269
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:39,529
implementations actually did turned out

270
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:43,189
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft when they implemented</font>

271
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:46,189
that shows to support only utf-8 for

272
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:48,559
very good reasons and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

273
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:51,079
encoding that works as sufficient so we

274
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:56,029
are removing the eyes or requirement

275
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:58,910
from the spec the all the normative

276
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:00,889
references to ancient RFC specs are gone

277
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:07,009
so it's now based on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons one</font>

278
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:09,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one specs and when I wrote that</font>

279
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:13,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">speck in 2010 I was under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the impression</font>

280
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:13,089
that I had to

281
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,459
extends the existing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> B and F</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4</font>

282
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:23,230
parameters<font color="#E5E5E5"> in HTTP it's six years later</font>

283
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">now and I realized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we actually</font>

284
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:29,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">never had a standard a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> B and F four</font>

285
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,830
parameters so I have restructured the

286
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:35,380
document not trying to redefine

287
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,810
something that doesn't really exist so

288
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:42,450
some of which some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the stuff that</font>

289
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:48,880
used to be in a B and F now is in prose

290
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:52,540
next slide so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have done all</font>

291
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:57,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the changes I wanted to do some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

292
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:59,829
changes I did last<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday a days ago in</font>

293
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,870
in the evening so I probably introduce

294
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,080
some breakage and I need to review what

295
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:07,050
i submitted on that evening and once

296
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,920
I've done that I think we already

297
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:16,510
technically for working group last hour

298
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:18,610
that being said this back<font color="#CCCCCC"> also changed</font>

299
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,250
to an experiment in spring where we

300
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:24,820
actually introduced non-ascii characters

301
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:36,029
in two examples to test the submission

302
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:36,029
pass in the ITF data tracker and we we

303
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:47,410
arranged that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iesg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back then and the</font>

304
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,990
RFC editor<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with that so this now</font>

305
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,910
works for this draft but it's not

306
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,480
totally clear whether we can leave

307
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,010
things as they are if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

308
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,140
if we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit that for</font>

309
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,939
publication will need to find out this

310
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:10,470
week<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess otherwise we have to back</font>

311
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:15,960
out these changes next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> but okay</font>

312
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:22,170
good so any discussion of that draft any

313
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:24,750
questions for Julian I know that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

314
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,699
probably one of the lower level drafts

315
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:30,540
that a lot of people might not take a

316
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,980
deep look at for me I we were having

317
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,370
discussion over lunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this a bit</font>

318
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:38,910
about you know can we use utf-8 in in

319
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,530
headers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm starting to think that</font>

320
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing that we might want to add to</font>

321
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:45,750
this draft is and this is personally is

322
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,760
is an explanation of why you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

323
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this encoding and not use for</font>

324
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,650
example utf-8 if you're defining a new

325
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:54,390
header because there is so much software

326
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,209
in and this comes up in a number of

327
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,500
places in HTTP we're on the wire maybe

328
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,450
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the server you can</font>

329
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,160
count on you know having a clean<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

330
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,240
coding but once you jump through all the

331
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,409
different hopes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different pieces</font>

332
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,390
of software that's going to touch a

333
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,700
header<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't make assumptions about</font>

334
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,930
encoding and you can't say you know put

335
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in utf-8</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and know that all the</font>

336
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,560
frameworks and and and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client-side</font>

337
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,510
api's are going to handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that properly</font>

338
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:20,040
and so there may actually be a place for

339
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:23,930
this encoding even going forward so that

340
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:26,220
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be all pros on the motivation I</font>

341
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,020
I'm starting to think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way so i</font>

342
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,000
might try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and write up a polar question</font>

343
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that safe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people agree with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that or not</font>

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,720
released<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the discussion and this</font>

345
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of touches on the discussion of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GFE</font>

346
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,860
as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get there which might</font>

347
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:42,030
have that part about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivations or</font>

348
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:49,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">we might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just move things over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure okay</font>

349
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:55,039
thank you um so our next door

350
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:57,350
if i can find this again is key in

351
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:00,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">buenos aires we talked about parking</font>

352
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,658
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> spec i still see a decent amount of</font>

353
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:05,449
interest in the capability that's

354
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:07,760
provided by<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spec but i don't see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

355
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,679
as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest in implementation there</font>

356
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,289
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been people who have said they've</font>

357
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,820
started an implantation but we haven't

358
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:17,570
yet and it's seen any<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop or any</font>

359
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,309
full implementation in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cache and I'm</font>

360
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,678
uncomfortable pushing this effect

361
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:25,158
forward until we get some implementation

362
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,559
experiment experience mostly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

363
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:30,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of have one shot at it you know if</font>

364
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:32,870
you want to change the format of how it

365
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,789
works or change the vocabulary and that

366
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,768
you have for talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about request</font>

367
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:39,289
headers you'd have to introduce a new

368
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:43,250
key like header and that gets pretty

369
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:45,169
unscalable pretty quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if we if</font>

370
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,149
anybody wants to talk about key what we

371
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:49,309
can do that now but but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it sits</font>

372
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:56,029
parked until we get more implementer

373
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:57,610
experience or interest and then I guess

374
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:59,600
the follow-on question Alexei are you

375
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:04,850
comfortable with having a document<font color="#E5E5E5"> park</font>

376
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:08,860
like that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that purpose we do have</font>

377
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:16,850
other things to do yes it's true<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

378
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:27,168
anything understood Alexei says we're

379
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:30,110
okay so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next up is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

380
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:32,659
hints draft and Ilya is not here Ilya

381
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:36,860
gregorich from google is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the editor on</font>

382
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:38,659
that one this is work that as i

383
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,519
understand it we're pretty much ready to

384
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,380
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group last call and on our</font>

385
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:46,159
side but there's a corresponding

386
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:48,470
integration of what to do how to handle

387
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:49,580
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> hint generation in the browser</font>

388
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,200
that's happening in the fetch

389
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,928
specification in the what working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

390
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,059
and so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting for that to be</font>

391
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:58,399
completed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to be solidified before we</font>

392
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:00,260
actually ship this back so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's</font>

393
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:02,139
on hold if people want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

394
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,550
reviewing it that's fine

395
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,990
I'm actually fine doing an extended

396
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,340
working group last call on it if we want

397
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">to just to make sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it does get an</font>

398
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:14,100
appropriate level of review but I think

399
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:14,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our work is pretty much done Julian</font>

400
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:22,959
Julian<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rushka in relation to key and</font>

401
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:27,400
client ins I think Clanton's currently

402
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,430
sort of relies on key being there so if

403
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,980
we decide to let key sitting there<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

404
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:35,790
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> client inspect to at</font>

405
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:39,250
least change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reference to be</font>

406
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:41,470
informative yeah and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you open an</font>

407
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:46,240
issue about that and we discussed it a

408
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:48,400
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> um my personal feeling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

409
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,650
that it is effectively an informative

410
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,030
reference you don't need to use key to

411
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:57,220
use client hits it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just makes it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

412
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:58,930
more efficient and saying that I'm not

413
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,310
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and looking at the issues</font>

414
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,260
lists for these which maybe we should do

415
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:05,040
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not missing</font>

416
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,040
any discussions

417
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:24,120
so yeah there were a few things up and

418
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:29,070
more recently you opened an editorial

419
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:36,780
issue the quoted string handling for

420
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:39,300
parameter active what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yes back</font>

421
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,040
to key for a moment oh right that was

422
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,960
just about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ad we parked this until</font>

423
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,389
he got more experience with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's</font>

424
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,890
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a future feature and</font>

425
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,810
that's these are all things that we

426
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,190
thought we could sit on until we knew

427
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:53,100
that we were actually to move forward

428
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,620
with the spec<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good and for klein</font>

429
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,379
hints yeah so you opened the normative

430
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:02,459
reference to key spec<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that can't</font>

431
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:17,970
be flipped into informative does that

432
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:20,550
make sense to you so to channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> julian</font>

433
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,650
he thinks it depends on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specific</font>

434
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:26,280
text and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> does require some other</font>

435
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes as well okay so let's talk that</font>

436
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,950
through and this issue here I believe we

437
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,050
said that is really just a placeholder

438
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,630
for discussion in the what working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

439
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:48,440
yeah and with the HTML spec actually as

440
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:48,440
well oh sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that one</font>

441
00:22:50,450 --> 00:23:01,070
so that is issue 156 but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last I</font>

442
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,690
talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elliot he thought we could</font>

443
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,080
probably go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this forward</font>

444
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,490
as long as we were happy with the state

445
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:18,889
of what's in the wet working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

448
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:28,070
from fielding for hints not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

449
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:35,060
security considerations are adequate<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

450
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:36,919
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you file an issue I client him to</font>

452
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,330

455
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,480
that's expanding the capabilities that

456
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:57,560
those sites would have or the

00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,040

I could you please<font color="#E5E5E5"> open an issue for</font>

463
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,960
is the origin frame

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:46,780
ah you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think is easier so</font>

465
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:51,270
right now we have two issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh put on</font>

466
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:53,799
this the first one is 178 open by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin</font>

00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:01,059
to narrow scope but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we accept 177</font>

claim two wild cards without a new

boarding the entire space at a high cost

478
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:22,570
and with the privacy risk one way to

479
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:26,168
avoid that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be to support the use</font>

480
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:36,580
of a wild card and the rules in RFC 2018

481
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:37,020
are probably appropriate yeah and we had

482
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,179
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

483

do that that's not a here nor there yeah

485
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,760
yeah nothing I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to vote</font>

487
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,260
an issue but is it specified anywhere

488
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,090
like how origin frames interact with all

489
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,400
the SPC for example like what is the

490
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:01,350
origin specified when you do an office

491
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,600
we see somewhere and like it seems like

492
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:09,300
we should use the original origin as

493
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:14,159
stole the rules for origin brings could

494

<font color="#CCCCCC">Ben Schwartz from jigsaw and you know</font>

496
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,240
I've spoken with some HTTP experts who

497
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">who say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you really should never</font>

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:39,930
you you shouldn't really trust the

independent trust anchors and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

504
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,600
wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that applies here if so if</font>

505
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:54,080
I don't see anything in the Security

506
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,490
section indicating whether this is

507
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,050
considered to be appropriate for use

508
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:05,490
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> combination of origins that that</font>

509
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:08,790
are not mutually trusting so the context

510
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is that this is a facility to help</font>

511
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,170
with the HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> two connection bullying</font>

512
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,850
the advice that you are talking about is

513
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,910
in my experience that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually brought</font>

514
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,889
up for HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and this is not an HTTP</font>

515
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,270
one mechanism this is HP<font color="#CCCCCC"> two already</font>

516
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">allows connection pooling where you can</font>

517
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,240
have multiple origins on a single

518
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,810
connection under certain circumstances

519
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,570
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about more carefully</font>

520
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:33,600
allowing the server to specify which of

521
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:38,879
the origins than a certificate or covers

522
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,949
to be used on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that connection right well</font>

523
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,380
so I would appreciate a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little more</font>

524
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,660
clear guidance on whether this is

525
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,250
appropriate to use with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> combination of</font>

526
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,570
origins on a single connection where

527
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,410
those origins don't have a trust

528
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,060
relationship I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the guy</font>

529
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,710
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably as an HTTP</font>

530
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,320
to itself because<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that the</font>

532
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,070
happy to show you we can talk to you

533
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:02,139
that them I don't doubt that more

534
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:06,240
guidance would be good but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

535
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,240
probably not for this spec I think yeah

536
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:19,780
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on ok too that's better Mike</font>

537
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,320
bishop I think the other comment there

538
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:26,290
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with vanilla hgp to connection</font>

539
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,649
coalescing all the origins you deal with

540
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,540
are in the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> cert so there is likely</font>

541
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,640
more of a thrust relationship there now

542
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,350
if we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the route of supporting</font>

543
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,110
multiple certs which we're going to talk

544
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:40,389
about friday that's when things start to

545
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,340
get interesting about do those multiple

546
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,020
origins and multiple sorts have a trust

547
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship or do they just happen to</font>

548
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,940
be on the same server sure sometimes

549
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,800
you're just staring at what's on the

550
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,900
screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you are talking about flags</font>

551
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,770
hmm and it turns out that we actually

552
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:58,870
have now a pattern that's evolving where

553
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:02,260
we're using these flags to say to sort

554
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:04,510
of build up an image of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what a set of</font>

555
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,250
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is yes and we have the positive</font>

556
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,990
and we have the negative and we have

557
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,600
this is these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things</font>

558
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we have that we'd like to reset</font>

559
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,899
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to see us actually</font>

560
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:22,840
work on a coherent pattern how about an

561
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:24,610
HTTP two sets<font color="#CCCCCC"> frames yeah no I agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

562
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,750
think that some best practices at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

563
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,370
very least would be a nice thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

564
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,880
here so we don't reinvent the wheel

565
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:35,020
every time yeah yeah and and since Mike

566
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:38,350
brought up the we will talk on Friday

567
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:40,180
about the server certificates thing from

568
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,429
what I've seen so far there's fairly

569
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,440
strong interest in having a facility to

570
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:47,470
add new certificates to a connection

571
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow and the question that that's in</font>

572
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,450
the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my mind now is should we</font>

573
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,340
maybe hold this specific specification

574
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,050
back a little bit until<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know more</font>

575
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that because it seems like there's</font>

576
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,080
a level of coordination that might need

577
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen there so people have thoughts</font>

578
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,830
about that I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear them so I</font>

579
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,490
actually filed issue 2 12 and forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

580
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,780
tag it

581
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,700
virgin when I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so we didn't come</font>

582
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:18,850
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your search oh ok I can I can fix</font>

583
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:23,920
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you consider it fixed Oh Martin</font>

584
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:25,780
you beat<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to it so um I think the</font>

585
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,950
outcome on this particular issue is what

586
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,540
Martin was just saying which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

587
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,300
figure out some generic patterns for how

588
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:34,120
to handle working with sets of metadata

589
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:38,559
in HD two frames and then apply that

590
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:48,219
here regarding your issue where did it

591
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:50,320
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 212 so that's along similar lines</font>

592
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:59,050
isn't it which is you're adding

593
00:30:50,320 --> 00:31:00,370
requirements to that good so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

594
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:04,960
these three issues are all of the same

595
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:08,139
kind of ilk in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense so so what I</font>

596
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,820
just spoke about about holding off on

597
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,800
this back a little bit not not stopping

598
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,750
discussion but not pushing forward to

599
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,129
working group last call quite yet are

600
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:19,510
people happy to wait around a little bit

601
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:22,420
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it I see nodding heads I don't</font>

602
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:29,170
see any shaking heads my co-author is

603
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:32,830
nodding his head which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good ok next</font>

604
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:35,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">up is is perhaps a little more of a</font>

605
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,780
substantial discussion especially given

606
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,510
the recent activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the mailing list</font>

607
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:43,649
the jfv spec so do you want to do an

608
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,650
overview of that first Julian

609
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,668
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I used to have slides that are</font>

610
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:03,309
brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many previous meetings</font>

611
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:07,630
explaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the problems related to</font>

612
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:11,860
header field value syntax and I am NOT

613
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:14,830
repeating them now so rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font>

614
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:20,559
I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to summarize what's been</font>

615
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:24,129
discussed on the mailing lists lately so

616
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,690
so not yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently I mean I started</font>

617
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:31,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as a thought experiment two years</font>

618
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:34,720
ago because people were confused about

619
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:37,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to define syntax for new header</font>

620
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,720
fields and we've been wondering what if

621
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:43,629
we had to stand out<font color="#E5E5E5"> grammar for that and</font>

622
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,610
I played<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with with the idea how</font>

623
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,679
it would look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if Jason would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

624
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:52,270
format for that although i<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

625
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:56,650
dislike Jason but I tried that so I've

626
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:59,379
been working on the draft in my spare

627
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:02,169
time over the last two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then in</font>

628
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:05,200
spring we adopted that as a working

629
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:07,179
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> craft with the underlying</font>

630
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,120
assumption that this is work in progress

631
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:21,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end up with something</font>

632
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:24,989
company us next slide so the draft shows

633
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:28,330
that we could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason but there are</font>

634
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:29,410
quite a few open issues or problems with

635
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:32,949
that

636
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:35,920
so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which being that it really</font>

637
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:40,660
creates<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very chatty syntax on the</font>

638
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:44,110
wire another issue that we have that

639
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:47,890
would be an issue for any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

640
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:51,669
format that we choose is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in HTTP we</font>

641
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:54,970
have the possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a header field</font>

642
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:57,610
repeats within a message and we can't

643
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">change that at least not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an HTTP one not</font>

644
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:04,240
one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is is it the</font>

645
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:06,430
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to define header fields in a</font>

646
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,969
way so that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually work with</font>

647
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple values or should we encourage</font>

648
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:15,969
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reject messages where field</font>

649
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:20,730
value repeats and concentrate on honest

650
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:20,730
in tax debt does not allow this notation

651
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:27,939
another opener issue is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

652
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:30,190
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just define for that we just</font>

653
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:34,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">provide for people defining new head of</font>

654
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:36,700
use or do we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to reek of it</font>

655
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,679
existing header field definitions to the

656
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:47,409
syntax and if we do how do we deploy

657
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:50,500
that looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jason independently of</font>

658
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:52,620
the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason syntax on the wire</font>

659
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,780
there are adjacent data model

660
00:34:52,620 --> 00:35:00,009
constraints that don't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> us very</font>

661
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:02,680
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the fact that it although it</font>

662
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:05,260
allows members to repeat in the message

663
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,299
formats<font color="#E5E5E5"> the puzzles don't actually tell</font>

664
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:11,260
you what happens so we have a potential

665
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:15,640
Intel problem here there's also some

666
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:19,450
ambiguity or not what the way numbers

667
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:23,710
are transported to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason make the use of</font>

668
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:28,359
Jason numbers a potentially bad idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

669
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:32,170
use as a protocol element because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason</font>

670
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:34,750
with a low float notation and some kind

671
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:39,589
of imprecision and so on

672
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:42,349
and then finally is this just something

673
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:45,730
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use on the wire for HTTP</font>

674
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:50,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">one dot one and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two or is the something</font>

675
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:53,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would solve all the header field</font>

676
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,609
valuable problems in future HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> specs</font>

677
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,609
so is there something we want to do with

678
00:35:55,609 --> 00:36:08,990
the short-term midterm or is that for

679
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:10,819
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long term yeah so so much Carson I I</font>

680
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:13,098
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a good summary of the</font>

681
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:14,660
discussion that we've had I think to a

682
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:18,410
large extent the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

683
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:22,069
been having has sort of been hedging

684
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:25,609
around the core problem which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how</font>

685
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:28,819
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is a schemer aware language</font>

686
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:31,848
that we're defining given that HTTP 11

687
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:33,349
header fields are essentially I mean you

688
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:35,960
have to know what the header field means

689
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">before you can posit so it's essentially</font>

690
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,400
skiing or aware but then each one of

691
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:42,558
them has this informal well a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

692
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,049
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this informal schema free</font>

693
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,760
component to the definition of them

694
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:50,450
where they have parameters or some other

695
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,950
way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> extending them so how much how</font>

696
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:56,960
much of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a scheme</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of free thing</font>

697
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:58,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">versa fully schemer defined syntax and</font>

698
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,190
that sort of goes to the decision that

699
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,040
we that you sort of went with Jason as

700
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:06,220
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually understand where the the</font>

701
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,380
boundaries are in Jason with respect to

702
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:13,970
extending and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that define</font>

703
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:15,770
themselves and where not to go such as

704
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,839
if this thing is defined as an integer

705
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,790
where I canted blob and an object there

706
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,069
and expect people to to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

707
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,630
don't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even though it's possible</font>

708
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:27,319
in Jason people don't do those sorts of

709
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:29,119
things so I I'd like us to sort of maybe

710
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:32,808
step back a little bit at this point I

711
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,369
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pH case talked about using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C</font>

712
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:38,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">bar in this context and I think that</font>

713
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:43,549
that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of really for me cemented the</font>

714
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:45,500
the problem which is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually</font>

715
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:47,299
understand what it is that we want out

716
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,700
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> process we don't understand</font>

717
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:51,089
where

718
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:53,609
it we need the sort of scheme of

719
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:56,549
reconstructs verse the very tightly

720
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:58,740
defined definitions and obviously

721
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:01,079
there's benefits on both ends of that

722
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:04,649
scale obviously if we if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage</font>

723
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:06,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack dates into the most efficient</font>

724
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,000
representation imaginable we had a big

725
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,460
discussion about this during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what the number is now and</font>

731
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:25,650
there's some real efficiency games that

732
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:29,759
not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of something bites but</font>

733
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:32,579
all sorts of other processing game so we

734
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,400
need to walk that space I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a little</font>

735
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:37,800
more carefully I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to encourage us</font>

736
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:42,359
not to commit to the fact that this says

746
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,599
possibility to either make things better

747
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:14,369
or much worse depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font>

748
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,500
items is the class of recent

749
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:18,569
vulnerabilities around how different

750
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,859
servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in a path to produce</font>

751
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:22,170
different header fields whether they're

752
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:23,640
repeating line wrapped so some of these

753
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">things around how do you deal with</font>

754
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,509
repeated values if we're not really

755
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,578
clear about that or if we don't make or

756
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,770
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick things in slightly the wrong</font>

757
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:34,890
direction we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> make things a lot</font>

758
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:36,359
worse there or if we are much more clear

759
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,848
about some of this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this goes</font>

760
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,109
to Martin's comments on my cat<font color="#E5E5E5"> configure</font>

00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">what are we trying to solve could</font>

762
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:43,319
actually make things<font color="#E5E5E5"> much better if we</font>

763
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:45,419
could be much more clear about when

764
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:48,560
things are and start being ambiguous

765
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:53,700
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are cases we must start projecting</font>

766
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:56,069
towards those issues so when we talked

767
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,859
about adopting this we were pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font>

768
00:39:56,069 --> 00:40:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as Jillian said that it might not</font>

769
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,410
look much like what it went into the

770
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,740
process

771
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:07,069
as and from the recent discussion on the

772
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:09,689
list it's become pretty clear there's a

773
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:12,510
lot more skepticism about using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason</font>

774
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:14,340
than there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was even a week ago so I'd</font>

775
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,990
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see that discussion</font>

776
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,660
continued I'm happy to keep this

777
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:20,459
document adopted as a placeholder for an

778
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:23,009
indicator of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interest in the working</font>

779
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,810
group in this topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again when we</font>

780
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:28,050
adopt the document the primary interest

781
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:29,850
that I heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> was you know specifying new</font>

782
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,100
HTTP headers is really hard and

783
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,509
effectively Julian is a bottleneck in

784
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,060
doing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if you want good</font>

785
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,380
review you have to take it to Julian

786
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:40,410
we're now having other requirements

787
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:43,710
being put upon what this work might be

788
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:45,060
and that might be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing but I</font>

789
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,470
think Martin's absolutely right let's

790
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,299
let's pick through them carefully and

791
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and why</font>

792
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,420
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what the implications</font>

793
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:54,360
maybe before we jump down a path to

794
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,530
quickly yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing to note</font>

795
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,720
here is that there seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

796
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">enthusiasm for fixing a lot of the</font>

797
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,790
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are apparent in the</font>

798
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing other fields we need to develop</font>

799
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:09,840
a story for how this gets deployed yes

800
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,210
and that has its own challenges do we

801
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:16,650
put in you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know do we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a date header</font>

802
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:18,660
and also a date star header from that

803
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:21,000
has this new encoding and what if they

804
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,759
disagree analysis of other things maybe

805
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,500
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cambodian and that is</font>

806
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,050
a separable problem to a degree i can

807
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,480
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach it so that even in HTTP</font>

808
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:32,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">two we could we could work something SUV</font>

809
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to we have settings exactly negotiate it</font>

810
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,529
but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you implemented we deploy</font>

811
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,890
changes or do you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change them</font>

812
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:42,450
all in one trench and you know what

813
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,850
approach that I've thought about is you

814
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:46,020
define a set of alternate headers for

815
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,759
the standard headers with different

816
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,200
names you see this has the same

817
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,880
semantics but a different serialization

818
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this is the precedents and error</font>

819
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,780
handling yeah but then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

820
00:41:52,920 --> 00:42:00,990
negotiate it to you so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

821
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:03,660
needs to be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more discussion around</font>

822
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:05,160
that and it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion on</font>

823
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,710
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> is becoming healthy which is</font>

824
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,299
good hopefully we'll see some more

825
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:11,610
drafts where people can flesh out some

826
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,540
of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect we're going</font>

827
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:15,329
to be talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one for a</font>

828
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:19,000
little while I think

829
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:23,309
yeah we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting so here's a</font>

830
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,019
question should we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come to a</font>

831
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:29,920
agreement what actually the goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> are I</font>

832
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:32,890
mean people everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has their own set</font>

833
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,529
of goals for this at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> from those</font>

834
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:39,609
involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion and I think</font>

835
00:42:35,529 --> 00:42:41,710
it's pretty clear that the singer that

836
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:44,348
we are probably not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

837
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:48,220
all these goals in which one format or

838
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:50,470
at least not within legs like 24 months

839
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:52,569
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should have a meta</font>

840
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:54,368
discussion about what what is this

841
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:57,609
supposed how is this supposed to help

842
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:59,700
what is the target because that will

843
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:02,410
influence what we can do I mean

844
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:05,589
discussing how head of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hughes could be</font>

845
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:09,609
represented an HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 is an important</font>

846
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:12,640
and interesting discussion but I don't

847
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:15,460
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should delay any help for</font>

848
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,629
people doing things with HTTP one not

849
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:22,390
one and two yeah so from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java how</font>

850
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:28,450
close are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we to reinventing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1 or</font>

851
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:40,920
turtle who is that from was it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

852
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:44,169
Roy oh ok I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think capturing</font>

853
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,480
potential goals is the very useful thing

854
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:48,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now maybe we just need to</font>

855
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,529
spoil the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wiki page and start writing</font>

856
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:58,289
down and collecting some of the

857
00:43:50,529 --> 00:44:10,789
discussion there any other

858
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:17,249
jfe<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I i will start a wiki page yes</font>

859
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:19,709
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that formal around here last</font>

860
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:24,209
but not least for today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see we're</font>

861
00:44:19,709 --> 00:44:29,399
doing very well with time uh we have the

862
00:44:24,209 --> 00:44:34,828
cash digest specification which we

863
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:45,229
recently adopted and the internets are

864
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:47,759
very slow all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden there we go and</font>

865
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:50,928
so we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any open issues on it</font>

866
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:53,999
but there has been some discussion I

867
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:56,279
think Martin raised some<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues around</font>

868
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:58,968
how complex the document has become

869
00:44:56,279 --> 00:45:05,880
since we had draft 00 which i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

870
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:07,049
fair feedback as an author on that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

871
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the documents where I'm</font>

872
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:11,549
an author so we have a separate document

873
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:15,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">Shepherd that's Natasha Rooney here in</font>

874
00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:18,089
the front row wave Natasha<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

875
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:19,319
personally you know one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons</font>

876
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:21,029
we did that was because it was hard to

877
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:23,579
anticipate all the use cases for cash

878
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:25,409
digest and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine a number of</font>

879
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:27,359
different patterns that both sites and

880
00:45:25,409 --> 00:45:30,449
browsers might want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in and</font>

881
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:33,179
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> went a little bit shotgun on it to</font>

882
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:34,519
see if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could capture those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am more</font>

883
00:45:33,179 --> 00:45:37,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">than happy to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a discussion about</font>

884
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:40,078
what the high-order use cases are and

885
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:44,819
and pairing it back down if that's an

886
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:50,519
appropriate thing to do does it make

887
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:51,779
sense to you Martin just not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thompson</font>

888
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:56,098
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to refresh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> state on that</font>

889
00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:57,900
yeah um so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of complexity</font>

890
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:00,299
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I suggest to be added and that was</font>

891
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:03,599
the Euro normalization or something at

892
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:05,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">least some hand-wavy stuff that so I</font>

893
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,859
really did we actually didn't meant to

894
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:08,699
respond to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't um so we</font>

895
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:10,288
don't really have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

896
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,329
normalization for the cash

897
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:19,499
so why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have it for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> digest to</font>

898
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:21,269
the cash exactly part of the problem

899
00:46:19,499 --> 00:46:25,229
here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people do to</font>

900
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:26,758
the octet that get put on the wire well

901
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're worried that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to lose</font>

902
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:32,369
something those efficiency yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

903
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:34,558
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only an efficiently an efficiency</font>

904
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:38,160
loss but it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> best to have some</font>

905
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:40,949
some recommendations that people follow

906
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,689
a conservative normalization perhaps

907
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:44,549
every conservative and it's not going to

908
00:46:42,689 --> 00:46:46,078
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> guaranteed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to produce it's not a</font>

909
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:47,939
canonicalization in the Senate you can

910
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">produce exactly the same low space to</font>

911
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:51,178
scheme locates the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host remove the port</font>

912
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:52,679
if it's a default port<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

913
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:55,619
stuff basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the stuff that is</font>

914
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:58,079
actually in the HTTP 11 spec sure with

915
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:00,150
maybe a few extra fingers to to sort of

916
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,589
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a bit easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did some of that</font>

917
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:07,890
exercise myself recently um and yeah

918
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:11,099
just nailed down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hole I have this</font>

919
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:13,469
stale I have this fresh and how you

920
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:15,689
manage those sets of information i am

921
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:17,489
the model that's associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

922
00:47:15,689 --> 00:47:18,719
because i found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that quite unclear yeah</font>

923
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:20,509
I think we do much better<font color="#CCCCCC"> add or</font>

924
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">editorial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then that's my fault of</font>

925
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:24,869
explaining that and maybe we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

926
00:47:22,529 --> 00:47:26,789
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> use cases um it seems like this</font>

927
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:29,009
some sort of mismatch between the flags

928
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:30,929
that used to manage the I think there's

929
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:32,729
four different sets of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

930
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:34,619
you can potentially send out and the

931
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:36,808
reset and the complete thing and it's

932
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:41,999
all a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit hazy would you want to</font>

933
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:43,289
do a partial reset<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this these are the</font>

934
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:45,238
sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you need need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

935
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:47,299
address but yeah what happens when you

936
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:49,919
put a reset on on a frame that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

937
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:51,449
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it and what happens when you</font>

938
00:47:49,919 --> 00:47:53,699
put a reset on a frame that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

939
00:47:51,449 --> 00:47:55,439
particular type of content in it right

940
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:57,029
you've just marked something as being

941
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:59,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">staying when it's got a tags and it's</font>

942
00:47:57,029 --> 00:48:02,069
also a reset on it right the intent is

943
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:03,479
and it's that I agree not clearly laid

944
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:05,099
out the intent is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you receive a</font>

945
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:06,779
frame like that you process the<font color="#CCCCCC"> resets</font>

946
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">you clear your state then you process</font>

947
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:10,409
the content because MIT do anything else

948
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:12,539
doesn't make any sense exactly that's

949
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:16,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the logical thing but not as charger so</font>

950
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:19,650
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is really good</font>

951
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:22,859
stuff I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's another basically</font>

952
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:24,270
fact that I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide around the</font>

953
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:26,290
probability stuff that

954
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:31,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">four a.m. this morning was thinking</font>

955
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:32,410
about but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this probably</font>

956
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,790
something I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seek out as</font>

957
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:37,420
experimental rather than proposed

958
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:38,830
standard and relatively soon because I

959
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,760
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> once we sort through all of those</font>

960
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:44,590
minor issues I don't obviously see it's

961
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">just not that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much that much to it it's</font>

962
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:49,450
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that many moving parts here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

963
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:51,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't get any value out of this until</font>

964
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,259
people start playing with it right and

965
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,820
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that but sort of</font>

966
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,560
rather than later what I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

967
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand is is that at least initially</font>

968
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,840
you know as a browser cache you know

969
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:03,310
owner what kind of frames would you want

970
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,290
to send out would you send out with

971
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:06,700
fresh ends Dale would you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a</font>

972
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:08,770
complete set or would you want to clamp

973
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,660
it down to a certain size there are a

974
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,830
lot of open questions there especially

975
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,420
on the browser side but also in the

976
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:15,400
consumers<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of course of what they</font>

977
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,420
find most valuable but to me that's more

978
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,060
intuitive I know kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of know what I</font>

979
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,890
want to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know yeah we're ensuring</font>

980
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,029
everything at the moment that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

981
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:24,060
problem and that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a real</font>

982
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:26,650
tight nice i want to say this it as a an

983
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:29,380
experimental document that's published

984
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:30,970
you know in six months time rather than

985
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,980
in three years time when it when we all

986
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,060
agree there's perfect because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

987
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,470
going to work this out until people

988
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:37,690
actually try to start using it on earth

989
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:40,000
at Stefan's done some implementation

990
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,500
work on the suicide it was great but

991
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
without a browser own experiments but

992
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,470
when I'd like to see this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser</font>

993
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,690
and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see some real telemetry</font>

994
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:50,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that serves out of that from a process</font>

995
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,160
to end point I mean we could publish you

996
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,230
know what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> call it for h2 an</font>

997
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,330
implementation draft and say we're using

998
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:57,010
this together feedback and burn one of

999
00:49:55,330 --> 00:50:01,240
the experimental frame ideas rather than

1000
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:03,940
giving it a real frame I did I don't

1001
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,470
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel about them I think I'd</font>

1002
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,510
be be happier just pushing it through

1003
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:10,000
the process just the experiment on burn

1004
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:13,080
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> frame</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my team yeah this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not like</font>

1005
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">complex how many do we have I forget</font>

1006
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:18,040
there's not many frame IDs yeah that's

1007
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,320
why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like I was 16 how many bits is</font>

1008
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:22,720
it in the private use range or something

1009
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,940
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a it's a night bit today but</font>

1010
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful with these</font>

1011
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that's why I'm a little bit yeah</font>

1012
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:32,710
yeah oh we may not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1013
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:35,120
experimental<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that i think about it</font>

1014
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:38,040
because they're only

1015
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,020
no because oh well I mean process wise

1016
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:46,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was right yeah cuz the registry</font>

1017
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:48,870
policy so you know so uh one of the

1018
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,490
patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a different</font>

1019
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:56,190
draft but I didn't carry on to this was

1020
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:58,200
I burned an experimental frame ID but I

1021
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:00,300
put magic at the beginning of the frame

1022
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,919
payload to disambiguate it from other

1023
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:07,200
experimental uses and that's something

1024
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,460
we could do because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it gives us</font>

1025
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,779
something you know three four bits

1026
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:21,350
whatever did you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry</font>

1027
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:21,350
posting or iesg approval my picture

1028
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:30,959
anybody else have a preference on which

1029
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:32,610
path to take there I mean you know if we

1030
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">only have 256 of these things that's</font>

1031
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:37,800
still potentially burning one of course

1032
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:46,200
we're still have status codes left over

1033
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:47,760
so you know okay um I'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a slide</font>

1034
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,609
discussion with you and we'll work on

1035
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,620
some of the use<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases is anyone</font>

1036
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:59,940
intending to implement this on the

1037
00:51:52,620 --> 00:52:02,819
client side or on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cache side cuz the</font>

1038
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:04,770
hold actually I have any subs are based

1039
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:07,050
implementation using headers yes old

1040
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:10,320
that could be done by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a double wall and</font>

1041
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:13,170
it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used immediately mm-hmm cool</font>

1042
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:21,600
and and yeah if folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> term kazoo is the</font>

1043
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:23,460
other author on this draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um I</font>

1044
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,650
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list and in some</font>

1045
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:29,310
back-channel i also got interest in

1046
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:31,860
people using this for non browser to

1047
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:34,350
server cache digest communication so

1048
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">cash to cash for folks who remember</font>

1049
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:39,810
squid has cash digest and has had it for

1050
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:42,420
probably two decades or so where it uses

1051
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:44,100
foreigner cash communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

1052
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:47,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we should explicitly target that</font>

1053
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,710
use case but

1054
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:59,300
we shouldn't explicitly disable it

1055
00:52:48,710 --> 00:53:01,730
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess oh yeah right were any</font>

1056
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,550
client side do you remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

1057
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:05,720
server side okay i think you know

1058
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,880
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of server-side interest in</font>

1059
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:17,029
this because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the potential benefits</font>

1060
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:18,110
so okay anything else about cash digest

1061
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:22,520
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did you want to say anything</font>

1062
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:26,180
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> no good for now okay all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

1063
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:28,310
um we have a half an hour left but i

1064
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:31,730
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's probably a natural</font>

1065
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:34,040
stopping point now on<font color="#E5E5E5"> friday we have two</font>

1066
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:38,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours and we have a fairly substantial</font>

1067
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:40,730
discussion of the cookie spec and then a

1068
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:43,279
few different<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposals that have been</font>

1069
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:45,500
in flight for a little while and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

1070
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:53,360
we do have enough time of it for all

1071
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:56,180
that Charles<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanted to talk about SD</font>

to do that now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Patrick</font>

1074
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:02,090
cache-control mutable are you prepared

1075
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:06,110
to say a few things about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1076
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:08,120
you don't wait till friday I don't need

00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:56,830
something we would actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:53,328
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charlton burg one I think yeah we've</font>

1108
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:55,130
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this a few times so this is</font>

1109
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:58,910
an informal event to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1110
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:03,079
discussion you'll go you're gonna you're

1111
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:04,730
going to give it a go I can put them

1112
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:14,690
like the itunes visualizer behind you if

1113
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:15,859
you want or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you</font>

1114
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:20,029
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> out my slides I'm going to talk</font>

1115
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:22,578
about a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> cache control extension that</font>

1116
00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:24,650
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and we are currently</font>

1117
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:27,049
deploying a version of this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox</font>

1118
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:29,119
after this being brought forward by our

1119
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:32,029
friends at at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and it's a cache</font>

1120
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:34,130
control extension called immutable and

1121
00:56:32,029 --> 00:56:36,529
it has basically the property of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1122
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:38,450
ask me if<font color="#CCCCCC"> this resource has changed an</font>

1123
00:56:36,529 --> 00:56:40,339
infinite number of times for an infinite

1124
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:42,799
length into the future and the answer

1125
00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:45,349
will be three or four and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1126
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:48,619
semantics of the extension so typically

1127
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:50,359
you would combine this with a really

1128
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:52,640
really large<font color="#CCCCCC"> max age which is what you</font>

1129
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:54,558
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> people doing today so this goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

1130
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,129
design pattern you typically see on the

1131
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:59,809
web where resources really sub resources

1132
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:02,660
images<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of thing</font>

1133
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:04,369
never change when they do change they

1134
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:08,058
just get renamed in the references to

1135
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:09,650
them use the new names right so Facebook

1136
00:57:08,059 --> 00:57:11,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">made a public post on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this topic and</font>

1137
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:12,440
they said some phenomenal amount of

1138
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:13,849
their traffic and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1139
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,510
because I have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> read my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own blog post</font>

1140
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:18,829
to prepare from slides which don't exist

1141
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:23,240
maybe twenty percent of their traffic

1142
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:26,869
was essentially a 30 fours for resources

1143
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:28,879
that had not been around that had not

1144
00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:30,890
been alive as long as the max age they

1145
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,960
were published with right so they

1146
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:34,520
publish a max age of a year and people

1147
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,990
you know four minutes after this

1148
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,660
resource came into existence<font color="#CCCCCC"> are saying</font>

1149
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:40,129
hey have you changed you and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> first we</font>

1150
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:41,660
were all like looking around at our cash

1151
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:44,690
code like why are we not trusting our

1152
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:47,450
cash code twenty percent adds huge

1153
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:48,800
number and a huge number of round trips

1154
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:50,598
from you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latency sensitive</font>

1155
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,099
client point of view and a huge amount

1156
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:55,010
of load<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look this up in</font>

1157
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to generate a three or four um so if you</font>

1158
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:59,990
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at somebody's wall page on a lot of</font>

single beloved single reload single

1163
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:14,328
reload in a relationship yes right and

1164
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:16,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand HTV transactions</font>

1165
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:18,230
happened on those five reloads when what

1166
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">you were really interested in getting</font>

1167
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:22,910
was the update on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark-up so that's</font>

1168
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:24,680
like what's behind this so just for fun

1169
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:25,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we sort of ran a mock up with</font>

1170
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,020
facebook and it performed

1171
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:29,119
extraordinarily well taking what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1172
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:31,190
would expect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two hundred resources</font>

1173
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,800
on that page click and reload turning it

1174
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:36,530
into three or four transactions right

1175
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,150
really nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I publish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this on my</font>

1176
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:41,480
blog I started getting a bunch of tweets

1177
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:43,430
five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> six like other very small little</font>

1178
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,390
websites<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started publishing this</font>

1179
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:47,480
because it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy little</font>

1180
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:49,098
attribute just just to do and that seems

1181
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,859
to be working out well so this is

1182
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:54,740
currently I believe in the firefox beta

1183
00:58:51,859 --> 00:58:57,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">channel the reason I wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1184
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring it forward as as an internet draft</font>

1185
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:01,098
to this meeting as we haven't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1186
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">under out on release yet and run the</font>

1187
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:04,069
official experiment to see what the

1188
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,990
numbers look like but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the</font>

1189
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:08,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">intention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Seoul or</font>

1190
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:09,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">something will bring a draft forward to</font>

1191
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,569
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen the most interesting</font>

1192
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:13,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing people want to usually talk about</font>

1193
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:17,000
is its interaction with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Max age and so</font>

1194
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:19,029
we should clearly talk about that the

1195
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,460
way I have it define the semantics are

1196
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:24,480
you know currently will always return

1197
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,910
three or four so don't bother asking

1198
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,350
so I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> honor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> max-age in case you're</font>

1199
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:30,509
doing hit counters or something like

1200
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:33,868
that but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens at the end of Max</font>

1201
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:36,240
age is a non conditional request is done

1202
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:37,859
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> object so if you'll never give</font>

1203
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,479
me a three or four I don't ever send if

1204
00:59:37,859 --> 00:59:42,420
modified since and that was the

1205
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,430
semantics of you putting immutable on we

1206
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,290
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that but that's a regular</font>

1207
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,609
topic of interest and that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1208
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:50,070
only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comes up in inhabitants</font>

1209
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">pork neck so so but but but explicitly</font>

1210
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'd be modified the semantics of</font>

1211
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:57,960
reload so that it doesn't mean a request

1212
00:59:53,580 --> 01:00:00,900
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big change I yeah I could</font>

1213
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:02,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">give right here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I could not hear you</font>

1214
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:05,640
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really weird only that's weird</font>

1215
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">um the change that the biggest change in</font>

1216
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:10,740
semantics is that for when this is

1217
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:12,150
present the real it's matt exchange so

1218
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,799
you don't issue a request on phone oh

1219
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,840
really that's correct I guess it is that

1220
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:19,920
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an automatic cat shirt without a</font>

1221
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:22,109
validation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right oh we also see</font>

1222
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:26,369
about twenty twenty percent of three or

1223
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:28,619
four members why aren't browsers

1224
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:30,450
actually taking the max<font color="#E5E5E5"> H into account</font>

1225
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:34,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">more often and not actually going and</font>

1226
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:36,450
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the research resource again</font>

1227
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:40,380
you mean without without<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presence of</font>

1228
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:43,350
immutable yes and so we interpret max

1229
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:45,210
age as essentially a lease period for

1230
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:47,460
which you can reuse the<font color="#E5E5E5"> response but it</font>

1231
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:50,430
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a guarantee about the</font>

1232
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:51,930
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the entity on the origin</font>

1233
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:53,399
server so we interpret someone is

1234
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:56,669
pressing reload is looking for an update

1235
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,800
of the data on that page is this not

1236
01:00:56,670 --> 01:01:01,680
quote different figured that was the

1237
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,390
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and its twenty seven portraits</font>

1238
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,609
right well the media bill allows you to

1239
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:07,529
disambiguate that a minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1240
01:01:05,609 --> 01:01:09,240
other large companies and they are also

1241
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:12,270
seeing around twenty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> what their</font>

1242
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,740
traffic is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> real horse yeah so I</font>

1243
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:15,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean that is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1244
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,830
brought up with so like well the max age

1245
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:19,980
is big enough why don't you just like

1246
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:25,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know imply a mutable and that makes</font>

1247
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:27,990
me kind of nervous sure because your

1248
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:31,049
content is immutable I'm worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1249
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:33,750
all that other captain George<font color="#E5E5E5"> investor</font>

1250
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:35,930
why would we have you up there and we

1251
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:38,450
are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reload</font>

1252
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:41,149
could you say to one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> sentences</font>

1253
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:46,009
about the difference what browser school

1254
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:48,680
upon f5 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ctrl f5 is there still a</font>

1255
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:51,440
difference oh yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so ctrl f5</font>

1256
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,759
has always meant or shift f5 depends

1257
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,900
there's a hard reload<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantics</font>

1258
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,020
depending on where you are what browser

1259
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,670
here in but the normal reload sends off

1260
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:02,090
a bunch of three or fours on a page and

1261
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:03,560
the shift reload ignores the cash and

1262
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:05,030
loads everything from scratch and that's

1263
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:11,930
still even in the presence of immutable

1264
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:18,080
is what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok Roy fielding you are</font>

1265
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:19,790
not Roy here thank you immuno immutable

1266
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,040
should just override all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

1267
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:24,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">max</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> age since that allows non deploying</font>

1268
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:26,750
clients to interpret max ages normal

1269
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:28,550
this is the design of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cache control and</font>

01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:30,590

1275
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:43,340
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to put information in</font>

1276
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,550
tools that idea for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that involved in the</font>

1277
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:49,610
tools team so so the other thing I was

1278
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:51,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to touch on I'm standing here well</font>

1279
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:52,460
we're still on that one have you done

1280
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:54,980
anything does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it affect your cash</font>

1281
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:57,710
eviction algorithm at all yeah why

1282
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:59,960
immutable does it what affect your cash

1283
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:03,800
shows action algorithm cash eviction

1284
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:06,290
algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok but it's an interesting</font>

1285
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:09,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">question now that you mention it ok but</font>

1286
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:12,140
it just not okay which means if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1287
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,580
deployed it without<font color="#CCCCCC"> max-age you would</font>

1288
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,839
get a heuristic number and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font>

1289
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's an awesome you don't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font>

1290
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that max age</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah so I was</font>

1291
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:22,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to mention because we we sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1292
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:25,070
concocted it in the same experiment we

1293
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:28,000
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed and more recently chromis</font>

1294
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:31,610
deployed brutally as a Content encoding

1295
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,690
option for the web<font color="#E5E5E5"> widely done it's been</font>

1296
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:37,880
really successful in terms of efficiency

1297
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:39,380
so you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into it from such as</font>

1298
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,150
in the client side the client side it's

1299
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:43,340
very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> in time and space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to gzip</font>

1300
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:45,350
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar it's harder on the</font>

1301
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:46,610
server side so if your pre computing

1302
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:48,920
it's kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> no-win and if you're not</font>

1303
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:49,280
pre computing<font color="#CCCCCC"> its or a no brainer rather</font>

1304
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,500
not

1305
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,750
win if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> free computing it's a</font>

1306
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:56,960
harder decision what I want to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1307
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:59,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">here though was purely from an interrupt</font>

1308
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,550
point of view we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over HTTPS</font>

1309
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:04,490
only and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has largely been</font>

1310
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:07,040
successful in terms of just learning

1311
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:08,870
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're oh look at that in terms of</font>

1312
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:11,150
learning what we're able to deploy there

1313
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:13,700
was one problem with one piece of

1314
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:16,450
antivirus software which its failure

1315
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:18,319
mode it passed through accept-encoding

1316
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:20,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">broadway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just fine and when it got</font>

1317
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:22,370
something that content encoded and did

1318
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:25,040
not understand it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that was</font>

1319
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:26,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and it gave the client the</font>

1320
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,790
direct byte streams of the message body

1321
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:33,980
but it stripped the content encoding

1322
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:35,750
header yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that didn't go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so hot so</font>

1323
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,070
but that was bug fixing out there and

1324
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,540
that was only the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> big problem so</font>

1325
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:41,060
it's looking like at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in HTTPS</font>

1326
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">concent context more of these in</font>

1327
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:44,270
coatings negotiated in the usual way no

1328
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:46,930
sniffing or anything like that is

1329
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:54,259
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> more possible it's not good I</font>

1330
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:55,940
use it on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> website yeah yeah no it's</font>

1331
01:04:54,260 --> 01:05:00,680
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> an HBS the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> West yeah is there</font>

1332
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:02,810
another way antivirus yes so following

1333
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:05,629
civil<font color="#E5E5E5"> hangar so I was following up on</font>

1334
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:07,730
this of the with immutable would<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

1335
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:10,430
makes sense to deploy only with HTTPS

1336
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:12,170
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you add an additional risk we're</font>

1337
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:14,390
like somebody submental adds an

1338
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:18,910
immutable property for our countries in

1339
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:18,910
the router so we only do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS</font>

1340
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:26,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mountains the other thing that you</font>

1341
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:29,930
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you only do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for strongly</font>

1342
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:32,270
framed stuff which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if if the</font>

1343
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:34,279
connection closes and to mark the end of

1344
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:37,040
the request that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> good enough well</font>

1345
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:38,420
HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or something with a content</font>

1346
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,460
length that actually matches aren't with

1347
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:44,180
the length of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes that you get</font>

1348
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:46,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah there's there's a bunch of geeky</font>

1349
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:47,029
stuff around what you've got to do we

1350
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:48,650
were talking with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in the mailing</font>

1351
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:50,120
lists the other day of how much this

1352
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:52,250
happens out there in the space that you

1353
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,540
get responses that have framing that

1354
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,590
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense in your right we</font>

1355
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:58,600
don't trust him you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> under those</font>

1356
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:58,600
circumstances good excellent

1357
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:07,260
Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You Patrick you did it's awesome</font>

1358
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:09,450
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have quite as much</font>

1359
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:10,620
extra time left anymore does anybody

1360
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:13,710
have anything else they'd like to bring

1361
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:15,270
up we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do any other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business today</font>

1362
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:24,200
and then Friday's left for the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1363
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:24,200
the agenda the issues list for<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1364
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:42,330
may have yes apologize i'm working at

1365
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:53,759
are heavier jet lag than usual ago that

1366
01:06:42,330 --> 01:07:00,000
is I think this one's done Mike isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1367
01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:08,930
I think we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot to close it let's</font>

1368
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:08,930
check yeah yeah why is this close um oh

1369
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:18,510
we did come to a state where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

1370
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:26,900
happy with it yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we can close</font>

1371
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:29,820
this mike is happy to close this cool

1372
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:31,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's all we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for today Oh</font>

1373

see everyone on Friday and don't forget

1374
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:38,850
the quick buff oh did you have something

1375
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:40,680
sorry Chicago Cuba laps I wasn't going

1376
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:42,839
to bring this up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group or</font>

1377
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:45,629
but since<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is time I thought I'll</font>

1378
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:48,300
just ask so this was a email<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sent</font>

1379
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:50,820
out a while ago about the bite the range

1380
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:53,010
request and the bites issue yes and

1381
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:54,660
there was quite some interesting

1382
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:57,030
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened and I was</font>

1383
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to just kind of get a gist of</font>

1384
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:01,050
what the final suggestion recommendation

1385
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:04,430
wall I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be helpful sure</font>

1386
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:04,430
so that is

1387
01:08:11,809 --> 01:08:24,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">what did we put that so there was a</font>

1388
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:26,009
discussion of as I understand it you

1389
01:08:24,029 --> 01:08:28,529
need a slight tweak tweak to the

1390
01:08:26,009 --> 01:08:33,210
semantics of the bites range unit and

1391
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:35,250
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was can we modify the</font>

1392
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:38,460
semantics in place for bite sword is a

1393
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:40,830
new range unit required and this draft

1394
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:43,380
was proposing the latter apart which is

1395
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:47,729
a new range unum and there was a

1396
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:50,489
discussion as a recall I think Roy was

1397
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:54,149
advocating reusing or changing the

1398
01:08:50,488 --> 01:08:55,468
semantics of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes if we got data and I</font>

1399
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:57,660
don't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put words in his mouth I'm</font>

1400
01:08:55,469 --> 01:09:00,239
sure will correct me if we get

1401
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:01,858
appropriate data that's reasonably safe

1402
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,259
with implementations and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1403
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:07,440
we have that data yet because there's a

1404
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:10,350
risk to it introducing a new range unit

1405
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:12,689
as well not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only in terms of you know it</font>

1406
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:14,310
will break or won't give you the benefit

1407
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:15,899
of caching for example with

1408
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:19,319
intermediaries that don't understand

1409
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:21,000
this new range in it but also we do have

1410
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:23,339
some data that there are some extremely

1411
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,350
bad implementations out there that

1412
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:28,469
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if ranges president always</font>

1413
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:32,310
bites and so there's risk on both sides

1414
01:09:28,469 --> 01:09:33,960
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what for me personally the</font>

1415
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:36,299
end of that cover the state we left that

1416
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:39,839
conversation and was we need more<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

1417
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:42,179
to decide which path is less risky so

1418
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,799
all right so at least based on our own

1419
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:46,230
just testing for the applications on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1420
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:48,810
library's we were using trying to change

1421
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:50,669
the semantics of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bite itself is actually</font>

1422
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:52,920
was very risky because we actually

1423
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:55,890
encountered libraries that just kind of

1424
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:58,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">flicked up so that's why we are</font>

1425
01:09:55,890 --> 01:10:01,560
proposing that I think the safer option

1426
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:02,969
is to actually go with the defining a

1427
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,219
new unit whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to call it</font>

1428
01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:08,850
and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand if there's</font>

1429
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:11,010
any objection to define the new unit so

1430
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:12,660
granted that with a new unit there might

1431
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:15,630
be some caches or some process that may

1432
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:19,559
just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they expecting just buy it</font>

1433
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:21,060
so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something period at the</font>

1434
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">very least the worst case energy should</font>

1435
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:23,730
be

1436
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,500
that they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cash it because</font>

1437
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:27,030
they don't understand it exactly if they

1438
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,550
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1439
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:33,540
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad implementations right</font>

1440
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:36,360
yep so so should we actually like try to

1441
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:37,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">un care about those really part of</font>

1442
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:41,598
should we<font color="#E5E5E5"> shall try to find out if there</font>

1443
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:44,460
really that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what we're</font>

1444
01:10:41,599 --> 01:10:47,969
proposing is is there any objection to

1445
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of moving forward with or proposing</font>

1446
01:10:47,969 --> 01:10:51,929
a new bite on you you need and we can

1447
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:56,250
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a name and everything else</font>

1448
01:10:51,929 --> 01:10:58,770
but I was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of left a little confused</font>

1449
01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what the recommendation was in</font>

1450
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:06,239
terms of a new unit right I think well

1451
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:13,320
does anyone the room have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinions</font>

1452
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:15,119
or thoughts about that Roy has a comment

1453
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:20,909
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really changing semantics</font>

1454
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:23,969
is just breaking stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font>

1455
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:26,280
certainly possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we would</font>

1456
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:27,719
look at mean in terms of adopting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1457
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">new draft we'd look at everything you</font>

1458
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:31,820
know that we'd look at for the rest that

1459
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">we adopt which is is an implementer</font>

1460
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:36,900

1461
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,179
set of use cases for HTTP you know we

1462
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,710
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> try not to adopt things that</font>

1463
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:42,420
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for a specific application but</font>

1464
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:46,139
rather that our general facilities for

1465
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:48,840
the protocol and I think that that

1466
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:51,150
certainly this probably is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay by that</font>

1467
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:53,520
letter metric I'm less certain right now

1468
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:55,409
whether there's implementer interest and

1469
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,270
and of course if we start a new range

1470
01:11:55,409 --> 01:11:58,409
unit there are potentially other things

1471
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:00,599
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be interesting to do at the</font>

1472
01:11:58,409 --> 01:12:01,710
same time other modifications that

1473
01:12:00,599 --> 01:12:06,960
people might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make to the</font>

1474
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:09,210
semantics killing um two points if there

1475
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:12,080
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really many intermediaries are</font>

1476
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:15,980
actually important pieces of code that

1477
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:19,739
do the wrong thing with an unknown

1478
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:22,129
wrench units I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know so I'm</font>

1479
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:25,799
totally in favor of having that

1480
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:30,000
experiment which leads me to the

1481
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:34,520
question in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> use case what you use</font>

1482
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,520
that over HTTP or HTTPS

1483
01:12:34,869 --> 01:12:41,799
both the the so I forget who did it but

1484
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:44,289
someone wouldn't did the research on

1485
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:46,269
this and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bugs that they found were</font>

1486
01:12:44,289 --> 01:12:50,050
in things like client libraries<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1487
01:12:46,269 --> 01:12:51,969
media for for streaming video<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

1488
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:53,409
this isn't necessarily an intermediary

1489
01:12:51,969 --> 01:12:55,360
problem we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly go and look at</font>

1490
01:12:53,409 --> 01:12:57,518
squid and traffic server and a few other

1491
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:00,489
open source implementations at least but

1492
01:12:57,519 --> 01:13:02,379
these were in you know open source and

1493
01:13:00,489 --> 01:13:05,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed source media libraries</font>

1494
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:10,479
consuming streaming video which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font>

1495
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:14,018
understand it your core use case so so

1496
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:16,749
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we I mean we haven't talked about</font>

1497
01:13:14,019 --> 01:13:19,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but we still plan in the</font>

1498
01:13:16,749 --> 01:13:22,148
<font color="#E5E5E5">midterm to actually open up the car</font>

1499
01:13:19,599 --> 01:13:25,570
specs and revise them for full standard

1500
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:30,129
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is whether the change</font>

1501
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:32,110
that Roy has thrown in whether that

1502
01:13:30,129 --> 01:13:36,249
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually that we could do when</font>

1503
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:39,509
we move to full standard and another

1504
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:43,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that comes to mind is the arm</font>

1505
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:45,749
shaky relationship between hydrangeas

1506
01:13:43,539 --> 01:13:48,669
and other content and coatings and

1507
01:13:45,749 --> 01:13:51,519
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something</font>

1508
01:13:48,669 --> 01:13:59,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that as well if we start working</font>

1509
01:13:51,519 --> 01:14:02,050
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that likes to clarify you really</font>

1510
01:13:59,919 --> 01:14:04,419
can't do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> rent request and practice</font>

1511
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:07,300
or something that has been dynamically

1512
01:14:04,419 --> 01:14:09,309
change the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> encoded yes you can</font>

1513
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:11,050
but you won't get what you what most

1514
01:14:09,309 --> 01:14:12,879
people expect I mean people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1515
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:14,829
understand the spec said that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1516
01:14:12,879 --> 01:14:18,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's Kia is here that you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

1517
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:19,869
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the intuitive answer yeah that</font>

1518
01:14:18,429 --> 01:14:21,340
and that's come up from time to time I

1519
01:14:19,869 --> 01:14:26,139
guess there's not yet been enough

1520
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:30,070
interest to pursue that so just to final

1521
01:14:26,139 --> 01:14:33,760
question so we were proposing is it

1522
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:36,999
possible to have have a bite you or an

1523
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,619
additional range unit as a individual

1524
01:14:36,999 --> 01:14:42,219
draft on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution or does it need to</font>

1525
01:14:38,619 --> 01:14:44,889
be a working group item that depends

1526
01:14:42,219 --> 01:14:48,010
upon the registry policy and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font>

1527
01:14:44,889 --> 01:14:48,830
that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be ITF review that</font>

1528
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:50,870
was the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch</font>

1529
01:14:48,830 --> 01:15:05,510
for most things and but we can find out

1530
01:14:50,870 --> 01:15:08,059
in just a month ietf review yeah so um

1531
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:10,220
because this working group exists i

1532
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:12,470
think my intuition is there would be a

1533
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:15,320
substantial amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pressure to do it</font>

1534
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:16,460
here and then and that's completely

1535
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,870
reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to have</font>

1536
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:19,430
the discussion with implementers and

1537
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:21,080
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it gets appropriate</font>

1538
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:22,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">reviewing it yeah there's no objection</font>

1539
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:25,070
so thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with I just wanted to</font>

1540
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:27,050
make sure that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are not</font>

1541
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:29,330
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really need the unit and</font>

1542
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:30,740
I'm okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> via okay to pursue the we're</font>

1543
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:35,540
talking to the right people for now yeah

1544
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:37,340
so um what we can do is uh let's start a

1545
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:38,780
discussion the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1546
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to spend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little time reviewing</font>

1547
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:42,710
it and see if we can come to some idea

1548
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:46,550
about whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to adopt it thank</font>

1549
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:57,320
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay anybody have anything</font>

1550
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:59,120
else um since we seem to have time even

1551
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:02,900
that seems to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> shrinking there was a</font>

01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:05,780
topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> thats they raised on the list a</font>

1553
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:09,410
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> a back in March about once we start</font>

1554
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:10,969
having early data and TLS 13 what is it

1555
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:14,540
act what's the interaction and binding

1556
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:16,670
into HTTP and we haven't really talked

1557
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:17,840
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much recently that I saw but</font>

1558
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:20,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it seems like something we're going to</font>

1559
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:22,010
potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to raise duty lista</font>

1560
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:24,230
saying hey those special API here

1561
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:26,180
there's I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1562
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">some clarification of when it's okay for</font>

1563
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:35,900
HTTP clients to use at API yes so go

1564
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:37,700
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom Thompson this is this is</font>

1565
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,980
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy thing to</font>

1566
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:42,230
answer so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of discussion</font>

1567
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:44,169
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one and Patrick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made some</font>

1568
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:47,389
interesting discoveries about how people

1569
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:51,680
replay requests in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real world and it</font>

1570
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:54,770
turns out that you have to replay posts

1571
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:58,010
yes the internet depends on the web

1572
01:16:54,770 --> 01:17:00,170
depends on it and if you don't

1573
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:02,360
everything breaks and there's some

1574
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:05,150
really funky examples of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patrick</font>

1575
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:07,280
go into the just mind-boggling be

1576
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:09,320
terrible but the net effect of that is

1577
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,790
you end up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation where if you</font>

1578
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,580
send a post request and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

1579
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:16,190
bytes of<font color="#CCCCCC"> response to that you'll</font>

1580
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:17,480
automatically replay you've got no

1581
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:22,040
evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has actually</font>

1582
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:24,409
received that message and processed it

1583
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,610
so you have to replay it there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1584
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:28,099
of situations where you send the post

1585
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:29,480
request and the server kids kills the

1586
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:33,139
connection and expects you to retry

1587
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:35,599
again and that is exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the situation</font>

1588
01:17:33,139 --> 01:17:37,369
that we're in with<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero itt we're in a</font>

1589
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,400
situation where we're sending a message

1590
01:17:37,369 --> 01:17:43,759
and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if the service got it</font>

1591
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:48,830
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point that arrives it could be</font>

1592
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:50,900
replayed and we're in a situation where

1593
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:52,519
we won't get any response back in those

1594
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:55,969
situations because well it's being

1595
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:57,980
replayed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> sumit a current and it's</font>

1596
01:17:55,969 --> 01:17:59,570
gone off into the ether but again the

1597
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:01,400
same in effect if it's not Adam potent

1598
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:03,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's not out of potent and you've</font>

1599
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,839
just paid some one hundred dollars twice

1600
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:09,080
rather than once all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those sorts of</font>

1601
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:11,659
things are real the fact of the matter

1602
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:13,809
is the web has this vulnerability

1603
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:16,820
already if we didn't asses realize it

1604
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:20,060
it's been there for a long time and we

1605
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:22,309
kind of depend on it so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> API that we</font>

1606
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:25,639
ultimately settled on was you were from

1607
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:27,530
the socket<font color="#CCCCCC"> your right to it you know</font>

1608
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:29,360
other signals there's only one signal

1609
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:31,699
that you need which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server told</font>

1610
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:35,420
you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're 0 RT t data was not</font>

1611
01:18:31,699 --> 01:18:37,369
accepted please replay and then you go

1612
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:39,920
off and obediently replay them all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1613
01:18:37,369 --> 01:18:43,190
that stuff again so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're</font>

1614
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:47,750
at and I was going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> some security</font>

1615
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:50,599
people open their veins but and I see I

1616
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:52,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two minutes that's just one of the</font>

1617
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:55,909
trials of because you have to deal with

1618
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:58,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and in that as i'm sure you</font>

1619
01:18:55,909 --> 01:18:59,659
remember i started researching at the

1620
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:01,549
same time and found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that intermediaries</font>

1621
01:18:59,659 --> 01:19:04,190
are doing much the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some</font>

1622
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">intermediaries respect the HP specs</font>

1623
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:10,159
somewhat but<font color="#CCCCCC"> none nobody does it</font>

1624
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:13,670
perfectly yeah yeah so Pat McManus ode

1625
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:14,950
to flush out that story in Firefox 46

1626
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,960
through

1627
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:20,650
a change I didn't fully understand the

1628
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:22,980
implications of I'm disabled replay of

1629
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:26,469
post on a broken persistent connection

1630
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:28,209
most of the time and I can say without

1631
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:31,930
equivocation that the web does not work

1632
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:33,670
if you do that um I dozens of blocking

1633
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:38,650
bugs people wanting to release hotfix

1634
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:40,960
releases it was not a good day but I

1635
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:44,170
learned all<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of curious ways in</font>

1636
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:46,690
which the web does require replay of

1637
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:49,720
post and everything else on some of

1638
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:51,879
which might amuse some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you um there</font>

1639
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:53,710
is a website out there that has a

1640
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:56,760
precision connection timeout in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1641
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:59,050
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of 250 milliseconds which</font>

1642
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:01,090

1643
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:02,920
number one could choose which results in

1644
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:05,560
a collision of trying to use that socket

1645
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:07,780
almost every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and yet the bug</font>

1646
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:10,300
report says works fine in IE in chrome

1647
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:14,290
right always<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and did in firefox</font>

1648
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:19,840
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> i updated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning have</font>

1649
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:21,910
another website that depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which</font>

1650
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,910
you are I you request from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

1651
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:27,820
actually execute that under different

1652
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:29,470
permissions on the server side and it

1653
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:31,900
doesn't know how to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that change on</font>

1654
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:33,880
an existing persistent connection so it

1655
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:35,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">just says oh my god I need to be</font>

1656
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:39,670
somebody else and closes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connection</font>

1657
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:41,890
assuming you will call it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh what's</font>

1658
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:43,630
really really fun about that is when

1659
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:44,860
that happens you of course just<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead</font>

1660
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of making a new connection you're like</font>

1661
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:48,759
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got this other Idol person the</font>

1662
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:50,740
connection i'll use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> long and so you</font>

1663
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:53,230
go like right through your pool and so

1664
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:55,870
unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are willing to replay at</font>

1665
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:57,459
least seven times you cannot

1666
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:59,140
successfully connect with the server so

1667
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:01,660
i think it's adam<font color="#CCCCCC"> langley</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that said you</font>

1668
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if t ellis doesn't repeat it or if</font>

1669
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:04,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">gcb doesn't repeat a TLS will repeat it</font>

1670
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:06,160
if he else doesn't repeated a<font color="#E5E5E5"> european</font>

1671
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,300
basically doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> reply if the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> damn user</font>

1672
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:10,950
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to hit reload and replace</font>

1673
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:10,950
themselves so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's gonna be ever played</font>

1674
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,180
civ oh thank our um so do add to this

1675
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,639
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's one part of the</font>

1676
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:20,950
component that's still missing like

1677
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:23,350
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the so basically it comes down</font>

1678
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:25,000
to like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the only one</font>

1679
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:27,780
who knows whether or not this data is

1680
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,780
idempotent and

1681
01:21:27,909 --> 01:21:31,509
and we can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> from dls we can</font>

1682
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:33,489
provide like various like

1683
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:34,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">defense-in-depth techniques to sort of</font>

1684
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:39,098
like limit the replayability of the

1685
01:21:34,989 --> 01:21:42,070
initial data but so we need a mechanism

1686
01:21:39,099 --> 01:21:45,070
for the application to tell the<font color="#E5E5E5"> loris</font>

1687
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:48,039
layers like it so the at the socket

1688
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:49,749
layer it'll just be a right but they're

1689
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:51,070
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> grout like if it's a mobile app</font>

1690
01:21:49,749 --> 01:21:53,199
works of browser there'll be something

1691
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:55,030
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of it which like basically</font>

1692
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:57,039
schedules or requests which can be

1693
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:59,438
written out onto the socket and does it

1694
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:02,739
which is aware of like the application

1695
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:05,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">level item potency guarantees so one of</font>

1696
01:22:02,739 --> 01:22:07,178
the proposals hopefully we'll discuss is

1697
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:09,489
HP workshop<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I but one of the</font>

1698
01:22:07,179 --> 01:22:11,229
is adding a header field which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

1699
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:12,518
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is retry safe so for example like</font>

1700
01:22:11,229 --> 01:22:14,860
even if you have a get request to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1701
01:22:12,519 --> 01:22:19,360
body then like the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

1702
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:22,780
no idea that's the body it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

1703
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:24,549
just not defined yeah but um so like the

1704
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:26,978
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell you through the</font>

1705
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:30,360
header like hey I'm I'm actually like

1706
01:22:26,979 --> 01:22:32,979
safe and you can replay retry me and and

1707
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:35,889
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> use cases for this also not only</font>

1708
01:22:32,979 --> 01:22:39,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the client side but also on the load</font>

1709
01:22:35,889 --> 01:22:40,869
balancer for instance so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um if you're if</font>

1710
01:22:39,099 --> 01:22:42,099
you have like a smaller data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1711
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:43,659
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1712
01:22:42,099 --> 01:22:45,519
bigger data center so it actually like

1713
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:47,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">there-there was Google paper about this</font>

1714
01:22:45,519 --> 01:22:50,189
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago where you could</font>

1715
01:22:47,289 --> 01:22:52,599
actually kind of improve your latency by

1716
01:22:50,189 --> 01:22:55,179
because one of the data centers will

1717
01:22:52,599 --> 01:22:57,070
have like not enough capacity so if you

1718
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:59,019
retry this other days that you saved the

1719
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:00,249
time out that you didn't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1720
01:22:59,019 --> 01:23:02,829
response back from the initial data

1721
01:23:00,249 --> 01:23:04,659
center so if you retry it and you can

1722
01:23:02,829 --> 01:23:08,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">only do this if like the load balancer</font>

1723
01:23:04,659 --> 01:23:14,469
knows it's safe to retry so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what's</font>

1724
01:23:08,139 --> 01:23:16,630
that well well like what is also like

1725
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:18,519
that depends on your application

1726
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:20,650
semantics as well yeah so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1727
01:23:18,519 --> 01:23:22,840
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like our up our application</font>

1728
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:26,829
semantics not fittin to like put and

1729
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:28,209
also like really put is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a in a</font>

1730
01:23:26,829 --> 01:23:30,009
multi distributed data center

1731
01:23:28,209 --> 01:23:32,079
environment like you can't really

1732
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:36,880
guarantee like the item potency you put

1733
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:40,090
as well so it as I mean it's like from

1734
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:42,040
HTTP spec situation it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's item</font>

1735
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:45,700
it's it's idempotent it's cool

1736
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:47,830
but it there's there's some debate about

1737
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:50,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as well but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah like</font>

1738
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">application API and header is like a</font>

1739
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:59,650
reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do it I'm like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opening</font>

1740
01:23:52,570 --> 01:24:03,160
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people think and given the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1741
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:06,400
of non in the somewhat surprising nature

1742
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:07,840
of post not actually of the item

1743
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">poaching nature are not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there for of</font>

1744
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,940
post is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's worth the</font>

1745
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:14,230
working group actually putting a

1746
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:15,639
document together to make this very

1747
01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:17,080
clear that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem has been punted</font>

1748
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,600
up to the application layers and that

1749
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:21,400
they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not assume the post is the</font>

1750
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:25,000
way it is in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> can appropriately</font>

1751
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:27,129
well you go ahead morning so someone

1752
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,840
Thomson I was kind of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of point out</font>

1753
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:30,820
that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that survived</font>

1754
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,650
was talking about are still relevant for

1755
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:34,780
people who are using HTTP outside of the

1756
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:37,000
web and there's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who use</font>

1757
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:40,210
HTTP for other things and if you're not

1758
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,220
on the web or you have a much better

1759
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:44,290
behaved set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that you're</font>

1760
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with I think the rules that we</font>

1761
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:49,900
have in HTTP 11 should still be

1762
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,720
respected and in general when people are

1763
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:54,759
using TLS they need to to be aware of

1764
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:57,570
this replay property the things that

1765
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:59,740
we're doing in browsers will be horrific

1766
01:24:57,570 --> 01:25:01,000
from some perspectives but we do all

1767
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:03,480
sorts of nasty things because we have to

1768
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,700
deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the swamp that is the web I</font>

1769
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:08,379
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's probably value and</font>

1770
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:11,920
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> it having a document that says</font>

1771
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:14,110
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see 7230 says these things</font>

1772
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:16,150
got so much to 31 says these things

1773
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:19,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the unimportance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II of these</font>

1774
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:22,299
methods you should respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that however</font>

1775
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:24,940
realize that when you deploy things like

1776
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:26,350
post on the web at a better damn we'll

1777
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:29,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">be idempotent or you're going to get</font>

1778
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:30,730
some surprises and that's I think that's

1779
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:35,440
useful guidance that we could give the

1780
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:37,839
community right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then then this</font>

1781
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:43,960
is becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> more relevant because we</font>

1782
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:45,010
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP fast are we have TC pls 1.3 we</font>

1783
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick coming down the pipe</font>

1784
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:49,960
potentially and all these have impacts

1785
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:53,350
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one of these that really</font>

1786
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:56,150
matters i think is is tell us 13

1787
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:58,370
but well and all the clear tech stuff

1788
01:25:56,150 --> 01:26:00,830
out there that's yeah you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know replay</font>

1789
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:02,000
happy as you like but you know well

1790
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:03,440
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have the same problem that</font>

1791
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,990
hopefully that'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be her honesty less</font>

1792
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:11,089
1.3 ya see it would be yeah suppose I

1793
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:14,000
her like last four minutes always take

1794
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:15,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">demostrate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him um so another like fresh</font>

1795
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have this like for example the</font>

1796
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:21,260
item potency properties and stuff we

1797
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:23,180
specify would it would it be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like is</font>

1798
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:25,130
working group like okay with specifying

1799
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:26,960
this is only applicable for like Sakura

1800
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:29,030
transports and you cannot use it for

1801
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,240
like insecure transports and stuff so

1802
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:35,450
that visa so you couldn't use like

1803
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:36,469
idempotent data on like TC TC fast open

1804
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:38,870
so that you would need a secure

1805
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:41,900
transport to like duties be faster than

1806
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:43,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus TLS 13 or tails 12 and then you</font>

1807
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:45,170
would get all these properties and like

1808
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:46,969
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similarly push and all these are</font>

1809
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:48,650
like new features are coming around

1810
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,300
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a surprising number of</font>

1811
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:52,009
protocol facilities where that decision

1812
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:54,410
has been made so I certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

1813
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:55,880
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could talk about but yeah I</font>

1814
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:57,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have to talk about the existing</font>

1815
01:26:55,880 --> 01:27:00,920
text in the HTTP RFC is to make sure

1816
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's still correct and as you were</font>

1817
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:04,760
saying talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about potentially new</font>

1818
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:07,480
protocol facilities to help applications

1819
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:09,860
get the desired properties more easily

1820
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:12,530
and also to communicate that information

1821
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:13,759
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the lower layers so there's</font>

1822
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:15,679
potentially a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to happen here</font>

1823
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,510
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we still have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a lot of</font>

1824
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:21,230
discussion I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll hopefully see</font>

1825
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:22,730
some new drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it soon so I can't</font>

1826
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:24,019
believe this but I have to like you know

1827
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:26,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">clotheslines because we're almost out of</font>

1828
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:28,340
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just seem to burn a half an hour</font>

1829
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:34,070
there without even trying and anybody

1830
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:36,800
have anything else oh alright so the

1831
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:41,290
quick ball again is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wednesday and we</font>

1832
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,290
will meet again on Friday thanks a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>
