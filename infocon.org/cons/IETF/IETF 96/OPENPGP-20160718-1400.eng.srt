1
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:21,020
so we can mr. header a big hand is on

2
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:22,640
the two and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little hand is on no the</font>

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,980
big hand is on the 12 and the little

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,740
hand is on the two and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can now tell</font>

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,580
time analog again and it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,980
the meeting this is open PGP if you

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,739
meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an HTTP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> biss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's next door</font>

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:44,809
if you wanted to be somewhere else check

9
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:46,970
the agenda so so first off just to note

10
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:51,680
that Barry has stepped up as co-chair

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:54,500
which is much appreciated so Christopher

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,600
looting stop is stepped down as co-chair

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,549
so just making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really knows</font>

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this is the note well if you've</font>

15
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:05,570
haven't been to an ITF meeting before

16
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:09,500
you should probably read this note well

17
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,059
and note it well this covers the

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,850
intellectual property stuff that comes

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:18,680
up in the meeting among others so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

20
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,850
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an hour</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half today the</font>

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,590
basic agenda is to just make sure

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,789
everyone knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were on the same</font>

23
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">page ensure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going to</font>

24
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,610
basically talk a little bit about the

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,960
registry issues because we have a couple

26
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">of requests for code points on</font>

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,300
registries and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> verner is going to</font>

28
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,840
present as a series of specific changes

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,610
for 4880<font color="#CCCCCC"> biss talk a little bit about</font>

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,790
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PEV mine that's mine stuff that came</font>

31
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:50,150
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing list and any other</font>

32
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,650
business blue sheets are good blue sheet

33
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">singular should be going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around if you</font>

34
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,900
haven't gotten it yet raise your hand

35
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:04,280
anybody have anything else that they

36
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:08,060
want to raise for the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't see</font>

37
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,919
anything so all right so just a brief

38
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,800
overview of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the documents to make sure</font>

39
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,609
that people are aware of them so we have

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,260
formally adopted what was Vernors

41
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:23,000
original drafting is now

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:26,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">group draft for RC 48 abyss so this</font>

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,239
basically is the original RFC 4880 with

44
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:33,769
some integration of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the elliptic curve</font>

45
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,930
stuff and a few minor changes are

46
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,810
underway so we're going to do more than

47
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,849
minor changes here going out to fulfill

48
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:45,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter discussion happens on the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Thanks draft is currently written in</font>

52
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,310
markdown if you want to actually

53
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,379
proposed changes we welcome concrete

54
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,349
proposals you might find it easiest to

55
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,230
do a diff from the markdown or you can

56
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,149
just send the words to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mailing list</font>

57
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,159
please use that there's a git repo here

58
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:11,269
that you can use if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull the</font>

59
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:13,429
draft but discussion should happen on

60
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,659
the mailing list so you're welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

61
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,609
a pull request but make sure then that

62
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,720
you make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy of that to the mailing</font>

63
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:21,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">list so that we can have the discussion</font>

64
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,449
all in one place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and archived by the ATF</font>

65
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:26,660
so just making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody's</font>

66
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:37,340
aware of those sort of guidelines for

67
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:39,230
contribution so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one of the issues</font>

68
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,500
that we've dealt<font color="#CCCCCC"> with on the mailing</font>

69
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,480
list recently is that we're getting

70
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to get some requests for</font>

71
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,768
code points that may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

72
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:57,680
that we think are mandatory to implement

73
00:03:48,769 --> 00:04:00,349
or or even necessarily advisable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,760
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very limited code point space</font>

75
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:05,089
because of the way the registries have

76
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,918
been designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in arts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to 4880 so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

77
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,220
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to raise these raises points and</font>

78
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,079
just put forward a concrete proposal we

79
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,090
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a specific diff for this at</font>

80
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,039
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but just a concrete proposal</font>

81
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,810
for one one approach that could be used

82
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:21,620
and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear feedback on the</font>

83
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,720
proposal so the registries right now are

84
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,919
mostly one octet registries where the

85
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:31,270
high bid is expected to be low that is

86
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,570
there basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7-bit registries and</font>

87
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,340
if we sir one approach the proposed

88
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,840
approach is to loosen<font color="#CCCCCC"> up our control of</font>

89
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,310
the registries in a similar way to the

90
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that TLS is loosening up their</font>

91
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,150
control over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the registries to allow</font>

92
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,790
code point assignment but not working

93
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">group endorsement so people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

94
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,360
good point<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we would need a</font>

95
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,280
larger registry probably than the seven

96
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,870
bit registry and because all of our

97
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,119
existing registries are basically seven

98
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,010
bit we can use a high bit to indicate

99
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,320
that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two octet value in</font>

100
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,960
the registry and then we get a 14 bit

101
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:10,240
registry inside of a 7-bit registry it's

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of a utf-8 ish approach but it</font>

103
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,690
would give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us enough space that we could</font>

104
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,169
do a first-come first-served and not

105
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,340
have to argue on the man list about

106
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:22,360
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get code point assignment or</font>

107
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,919
not so the approach to the TLS working

108
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,810
group is doing is that the registry is

109
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,970
basically our<font color="#E5E5E5"> first come first served</font>

110
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,620
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a expert review to ensure that the</font>

111
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,740
documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they point that the</font>

112
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,860
proposed assignment is actually legible

113
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,840
but no direct endorsement by the working

114
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,440
group unless they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lie in the</font>

115
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,320
working group y column and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way</font>

116
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,290
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on an extension</font>

117
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,599
they can just use they can pick a code

118
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,820
point document what they're doing and

119
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,020
get the code point without us having to

120
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:58,840
have a discussion on the mailing list

121
00:05:53,020 --> 00:06:00,760
about it so this proposal cleared if

122
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,669
people have questions about what the

123
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,480
what the results of that would be Phil

124
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look like you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

125
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,930
about it yeah I'm not keen on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ok the</font>

126
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason that TLS had to go their way</font>

127
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,370
that's Phil Holliman Baker yeah so the

128
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,020
reason TLS had to go that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way is that</font>

129
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,870
they made<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mistake of using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sweets</font>

130
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,719
and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't have so</font>

131
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:26,350
much flexibility I would rather have a

132
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">divide between stuff the ITF cares about</font>

133
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,690
and everything else i would like

134
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,900
everything else to be as far away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

135
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,510
IETF and I honor as possible so rather

136
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,909
making changing the registry in this way

137
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:43,949
mayra suggests is have one additional

138
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:47,050
code point which would be

139
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:50,289
eating the algorithm is specified by

140
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,789
annoyed and then stick the oil in some

141
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:54,520
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the packet or whatever that you</font>

142
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:56,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't care about and the reason that you</font>

143
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,990
do that is that then since anybody can

144
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,859
get annoyed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can have</font>

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,330

146
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:10,150
well I mean like in fact I have more

147
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:13,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">than one arc that puts the tagging of</font>

148
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,638
the crypto completely outside the ITF

149
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,430
process and means that people can't come

150
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:22,210
round and say oh my algorithm has been

151
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:25,210
blessed by the ITF and you know and I

152
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that we can say that we're not</font>

153
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,258
implying endorsement but you know

154
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:31,389
neither that every time we've done that

155
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:33,129
in the past the people who get the code

156
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,770
points then immediately go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and their</font>

157
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:39,129
marketing dept say this is ITF endorsed

158
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,438
that we've got a code point so that's a

159
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:44,080
way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you completely isolate all the</font>

160
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,449
vanity crypto from the stuff we care

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,990
about and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we ever get to the</font>

162
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:51,870
point where we've used up 126 remaining

163
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,460
code points well we've got a natural

164

<font color="#E5E5E5">expansion thing and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I</font>

165
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,359
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are going to care</font>

166
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:59,889
about how long odds are or whatever or

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:05,499
interpreting them by the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

168
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:10,029
run out of 126 slots<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there's a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">counterproposal there does is there does</font>

170
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:13,629
anyone else want to speak to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

172
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:26,520
counterproposal I'll strengthen that

173
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:26,520
discussion please on Phil's proposal

174
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:36,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Farrell's just as a</font>

175
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,500
random participant I'm not convinced if

176
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's argument that that would work so</font>

177
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
well because I mean I think marketing

178
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:46,690
departments can make any claim they

179
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:51,939
wanted they will so I mean who could do

180
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:54,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I guess would probably work the</font>

181
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:55,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">TLS kind of copying the TLS approach</font>

182
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,550
seems like

183
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,020
better understood thing unless you're

184
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,060
convinced that fills arguments correct

185
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm personally not and I have a question</font>

186
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,569
about Phil's proposal do you so these

187
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:11,990
other ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into oils would not</font>

188
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:16,160
be reviewed at all it just anybody wants

189
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,230
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything I'm relaying a comment</font>

190
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,329
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shawn Turner he says we've done</font>

191
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:27,830
this a bunch of times I p second TLS or

192
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:30,200
two examples banner<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh Donna um we</font>

193
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">already use object identifiers for the</font>

194
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,170
specifying the curves as so anyone is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

195
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:42,830
can put any curve out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and say it is</font>

196
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:51,020
on i HAF endorsed curve so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think</font>

197
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:53,720
that argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really song</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Parker's so</font>

198
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,910
yes we have done this in ipsec where we

199
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,360
can now use an<font color="#CCCCCC"> oid to decide what</font>

200
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,310
algorithm to use but that is a a life

201
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,260
happening right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to remote</font>

202
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,060
surf and i immediately going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide</font>

203
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,640
whether or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find that</font>

204
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,959
algorithm acceptable or not with PGP

205
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,510
it's a little different if I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

206
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,640
sign something or or encrypt something

207
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,260
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know hours later someone</font>

208
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,880
else decides well actually I really

209
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,370
don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bell riddim then we're</font>

210
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,110
years later then then you have a

211
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">different problem so i'm not sure if the</font>

212
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:29,660
mapping between TLS and ipsec really

213
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:31,670
maps onto this open PGP problem for

214
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,319
hamburger<font color="#CCCCCC"> good but part of the idea here</font>

215
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,660
is that it avoids the need to have yet

216
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,990
another registry and so when you're

217
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,850
writing the code uh you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

218
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:44,240
virtually<font color="#CCCCCC"> every crypto library already</font>

219
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,740
has a mechanism for here's annoyed give

220
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,380
me the algorithm that map's to that I'd

221
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,410
or I'm using an algorithm tell me the

222
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:53,660
oil of the algorithm if you create

223
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,640
another registry then that's another set

224
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,860
layer that I have to put in my coat<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

225
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,439
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> if somebody wants this stuff</font>

226
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,610
to actually be interoperable then

227
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,670
they're going to have to write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a draft</font>

228
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,140
as minimum however my view is that if

229
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,420
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants this to actually into our</font>

230
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,470
f / 8 they had better<font color="#CCCCCC"> be using something</font>

231
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the man</font>

232
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,960
interment or the very strongly

233
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:17,000
recommended by ITF<font color="#E5E5E5"> route or else it's</font>

234
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to work anyway so to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,590
the original proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> did not indicate</font>

236
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,390
any creation of any new registries it

237
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,070
indicates that we should have columns in

238
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the registry indicating working group</font>

239
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,330
approval and mandatory to implement but

240
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,100
and it increases the<font color="#E5E5E5"> size of the</font>

241
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,140
registry so that we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do first</font>

242
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,700
come first<font color="#CCCCCC"> serve without depletion but</font>

243
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,050
note none<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the proposals that on the</font>

244
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,090
table busfare have indicated the

245
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,589
creation of a new registry well yeah but

246
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it means is that somebody is coming</font>

247
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,900
to the ITF is with a an algorithm

248
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,420
they're trying to propose is going to

249
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,040
have four points of contact that they're

250
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get through with different</font>

251
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,390
rules or whatever and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm trying to</font>

252
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,140
reduce that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero so that we don't</font>

253
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,140
need to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font>

254
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,800
alright so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to post this</font>

255
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,950
proposal to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list in hopes</font>

256
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,560
that people can we can get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

257
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,560
speak up in favor of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the other of</font>

258
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,020
these proposals and maybe try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve</font>

259
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,180
some sort of consensus there on another

260
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,860
comment from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn he said I should have</font>

261
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,160
been clearer the registries are now I

262
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,490
ETA<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF consensus we've had examples of</font>

263
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:41,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">IP second TLS that went lusts turret we</font>

264
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:44,050
should follow these examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font>

265
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,760
less<font color="#CCCCCC"> tricked from TLS is this outline</font>

266
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,349
here this is in the slides I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

267
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,510
to go over it in full here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

268
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,640
everyone who comes to the IETF without

269
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,710
without needing to get working group

270
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,210
approval in this proposal would get sort

271
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:01,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> first come first serve gotta get a</font>

272
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,070
code point assigned and they could do

273
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,620
that through the for all others section

274
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,780
just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be clear that what i read</font>

275
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,560
here is designated expert review you're

276
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:16,150
not first come first serve<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks</font>

277
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,650
again yeah so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would that would</font>

278
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,319
ensure that the draft is basically

279
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,610
legible and we'd expected we would need

280
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:31,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">it true</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the desing to expert if you</font>

281
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:34,240
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to happen so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um anyway this</font>

282
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,730
will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mailing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font>

283
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people will get feedback on the man</font>

284
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,260
list and speak up we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe call for</font>

285
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:46,329
some consensus there so burner do you

286
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:47,860
want to step<font color="#E5E5E5"> up yeah so the pink box</font>

287
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,780
there if you're standing the pink box

288
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:54,780
then they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to get you on video</font>

289
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font>

290
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:04,329
on the mind play I suggested that the

291

reader two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago the thing is simply</font>

292
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:11,019
that out it would be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> convenient to</font>

293
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:13,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">have indication whether the content is</font>

295
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:25,259
hot that makes life and powers much

296
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:28,929
because my papa and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the another</font>

298
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:32,709
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning closer to the microphone</font>

299
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,579
kiss you can move<font color="#E5E5E5"> to return the</font>

300
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,839
microphone so that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

301
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:44,559
comfortable facing where you want to

305
00:14:51,100 --> 00:15:01,660
already have an idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in most cases</font>

306
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:05,610
you have any way on that is much more

307
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:09,639
flexible is not but it's just an easy

308
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:15,220
extension of it it has been suggested

309
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:17,019
probably glory so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're still</font>

310
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,379
you're still not good on the might get

311
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:23,139
it really close<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's on it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

312
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:25,319
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> far from your mouth no no no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

313
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,319
not

314
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:52,949
I take this this way don't see ok that

315
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,050
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the demand flag we have it in the</font>

317
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list and well that's it and</font>

318
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:08,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay this other thing is on the david</font>

319
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,600
has suggested to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> explicit words</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

324
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:26,040
on this later in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a later slide n so</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Verne are you okay if people come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

326

327
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,220
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we can go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your points</font>

328
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:39,690
yeah sure so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> singing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

329
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:42,149

330
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is on that that's also pretty easy</font>

331
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:46,680
arm we have in technet your packets in

332
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:51,390
turn signature we have the wrong key ID

333
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:54,300
so 64-bit key ID are to find pick the

334
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:57,569
key for verification about 64-bit key

335
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">IDs are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too short to really find the</font>

336
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:02,040
keys because we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily create</font>

337
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,800
creations on the 64 bits and that's a

338
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,659
bit annoying and actually dangerous if

339
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,109
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always get bad signatures with your</font>

340
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,780
ronke arm there is a proposal that we

341
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:17,609
put the fingerprint into an new

342
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,589
signature subkey a sub packet and very

343
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:23,099
similar to the to the issue a pocket

344
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:25,379
with the 64-bit key ID and this would

345
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,540
fix our problems there's a proposal

346
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:31,920
there on the mailing list and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

347
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:34,290
the issue tracker arm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

348
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,910
with new Kieffer matter later we can

349
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:39,379
fade out the use of the issuer's a

350
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:42,270
packet which needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay currently in</font>

351
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,550
openpgp data for back

352
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,280
compatibility but it's no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

353
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:49,500
implementation of our if the if a new

354
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue of fingerprints a packet will be</font>

355
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,140
added to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heart of the data that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

356
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,510
works and implementations can use it or

357
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,510
can cannot use it so what about

358
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:09,300
questions too<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay fine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iron yeah we</font>

359
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,210
recently talked about the thing which

360
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,580
would be nice to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> its it is another</font>

361
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:19,320
encryption sub packet arm called

362
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:21,899
encrypted to arm which is used to put

363
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,350
the recipient keys so if you sign and

364
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,600
encrypt then you can put the recipients

365
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:30,750
of to whom you<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypt it into the</font>

366
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">signature so after the the encryption</font>

367
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,260
layer has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> stripped off they're</font>

368
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,230
still the signature and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone can see</font>

369
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,720
I can check to whom it was originally

370
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:43,260
encrypted arm there is no proposal for

371
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:46,980
this yet it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be easy to to do</font>

372
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,260
something and I would like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

373
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate if someone arise a proposal</font>

374
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:56,370
for this how to I have a sub packet

375
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,830
which are carries the recipient keys for

376
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:02,250
the encryption layer on I have a

377
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:04,320
question as participant what is the

378
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,140
value<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have I know I see the value of</font>

379
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,669
having the recipient email addresses or

380
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,690
something what's the value of having the

381
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:15,240
key that you had used um where is that

382
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you can later prove or show</font>

383
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:23,910
that it was it has been encrypted to

384
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,830
this and this and because in what kind

385
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of attack is that you take it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trip</font>

386
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">off a strip of the encryption and</font>

387
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:34,500
encrypt it to someone else to someone

388
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:36,209
else anyone can do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and just on</font>

389
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature to claim something</font>

390
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,160
different so you're saying okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

391
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,649
you're saying if if you have the

392
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,490
original encrypted version and the

393
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:51,420
decrypted version you can rien crip to

394
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:55,080
check that nothing has changed yes yeah

395
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,179
welcome to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signature should be yeah</font>

396
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,580
well lady

397
00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:02,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">i said i sang i sent you and signed and</font>

398
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,369
encrypted encrypted mail yeah and you

399
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,129
decrypt it but keep the signature layer

400
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:10,309
and for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you send it encrypt</font>

401
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:13,340
it to someone to someone else well let's

402
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:15,830
say to the NSA or so Noah's Georgia

403
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,499
newspaper and but then they can detect

404
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:22,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it has originally encrypted for for</font>

405
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:26,690
you and so it is it was legitimate that

406
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are send it forward again I see so I</font>

407
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,899
see the value of saying who it was

408
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,389
encrypted for but I don't see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value</font>

409
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:34,850
of having the original encryption key

410
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:37,519
once you've decrypted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh no no no I</font>

411
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,259
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> meant mine so that the matter of</font>

412
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,879
the proposal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example put out the</font>

413
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,730
fingerprint into it and then you have

414
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:45,230
the fingerprint<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can figure out oh hi</font>

415
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,409
to me wasn't good<font color="#E5E5E5"> kid sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

416
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,779
misunderstanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for this we would</font>

417
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:51,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">need a proposal sir I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask if</font>

418
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:53,299
there's anyone in the room who'd be

419
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:54,949
interested in writing up this proposal

420
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:57,039
this is a pretty straightforward thing

421
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:03,080
and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great to have a concrete</font>

422
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:07,309
contribution anybody interested I'm not

423
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,509
seeing any volunteers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this this</font>

424
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,840
probably won't happen unless someone

425
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:18,950
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my demo folks on the mailing</font>

426
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:21,139
just yet ok ok so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the note-taker please</font>

427
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:27,679
note that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look on the mailing</font>

our<font color="#CCCCCC"> kdf function arm it has already been</font>

430
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,559
discussed a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so what</font>

431
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,879
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> code point for</font>

432
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:44,480
argon to you I and another code point

433
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:47,689
for no s2 s2 k at all we don't have this

434
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now um this is useful if you</font>

435
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,639
already have a a key with high entropy

436
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:55,399
so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stored in a database</font>

437
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:58,668
and you want to sound too<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensors are</font>

438
00:21:55,399 --> 00:22:00,830
out so um this wouldn't in war for this

00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:03,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">kdf the iteration and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tightening the</font>

441
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:08,418
applications this<font color="#CCCCCC"> R is very useful</font>

442
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:10,369
though some

443
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:13,909
so the proposal is to have two new coke

444
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:15,980
points are for these things and we

445
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:20,389
should deprecated all other s2k modes

446
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:23,590
which means also<font color="#CCCCCC"> the iterative in solid</font>

447
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:27,859
which is the de facto standard today arm

448
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:33,080
in favor of argon to I for the transfer

449
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:34,789
of secret key material and the last

450
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,559
point is keep unprotected keys is some

451
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:38,749
are rated to this of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should</font>

452
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,139
still be possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have on mon</font>

00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:50,469
our encrypt keys or protect secret keys

461
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:15,369
about the draft about that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i forget</font>

462
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status of it there but i hope that</font>

463
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:20,299
what's being done here and most being

464
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,049
down there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> design that's the</font>

465
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:26,570
attempt here yes so as far as honoring

466
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:28,519
my mod l may need to figure out our

467
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:32,539
define which parameters are to be used

468
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,619
them for this so yes ok so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

469
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:35,029
want to check we're not in danger of

470
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:37,070
kind of implementations here getting

471
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:40,549
ahead of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> documentation of the</font>

472
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:49,399
argument sincere<font color="#E5E5E5"> for j ok no good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

473
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:51,230
thank you kind of work<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

474
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:53,539
the same question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clarify that</font>

475
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:57,940
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to wait till see if audrey</font>

476
00:23:53,539 --> 00:24:01,190
has produced an RFC for argon to or

477
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,019
because as far as i remember but i don't

478
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,929
recall you exactly there was a paper

479
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:07,609
with attacks on our 12 I and there were

480
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:10,070
some debates whether the algorithm

481
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:13,820
should be changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to counter that attack</font>

482
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:16,039
so it may be that something else ends up

483
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:20,389
as being the standardized are going to

484
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:21,920
then what's out there now so my

485
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:23,719
impression of what happened there

486
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,760
that is it are going to I has actually

487
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,770
been modified but I could also be wrong

488
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,060
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there an easy frgt person</font>

489
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:34,040
here who knows more I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can ask for</font>

490
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,980
clarification in the sea FRG meeting

491
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:39,649
later like the point would be do we say

492
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:42,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">this will be delayed until see if audrey</font>

493
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:46,610
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> finalized something on argonne to or</font>

494
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:55,310
or is this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented pretty soon</font>

495
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:57,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage</font>

496
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,120
implementations to happen I guess one

497
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,680
thing we could do is we could say we're

498
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,060
going to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good point in place for</font>

499
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,500
our gun too yes I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't know if</font>

500
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,690
the changes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been considered in</font>

501
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,980
are going to I or affecting drop or if

502
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,530
they're just parameters that you can

503
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:15,290
tweak anyway and so I think yeah talking

504
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,850
to the safe orgy folks is a fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

505
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:20,440
to do but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also sort of say to</font>

506
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:22,399
them we want an argon to I Oregon to RSC

507
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,420
you know please don't sit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for</font>

508
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,830
years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it we don't want you</font>

509
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you know it's let's say they get to</font>

510
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,189
drive 10 or something you could say

511
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,489
we're going ahead with draft and please

512
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,810
don't do nun in tropical changes anymore

513
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,320
so if you talk to them I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it should</font>

514
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a solvable problem</font>

515
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:51,399
okay so are we have a lot of algorithms

516
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:54,250
and open PGP and here's a suggestion<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

517
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:57,910
what your duplicate are my thing p if

518
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:00,640
our triple gases are interesting because

519
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:03,400
it's the only must algorithm in openpgp

520
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,740
currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> are but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old that's</font>

521
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,920
nearly 20 years 20 years old that we

522
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,260
have it in open PGP and this should be

523
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,050
and is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality it has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> replaced</font>

524
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,940
by a yes so they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

525
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:19,060
implementations which do which don't

526
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:23,950
even implement Triple DES so I think

527
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:27,210
it's our it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to remove</font>

528
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:30,520
triple triple des md5<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just it's</font>

529
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,470
obvious a sha-1 we also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

530
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,920
duplicate this for obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

531
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:39,490
because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF and because we want</font>

532
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:42,850
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a few years so arm that's</font>

533
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:45,430
all I also suggested to remove char<font color="#CCCCCC"> 224</font>

534
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,949
because it doesn't really fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thereby</font>

535
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">why do we need for 4i rhythms and</font>

536
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:53,620
implement implement them so it's it

537
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:59,439
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make much sense to have this one</font>

538
00:26:53,620 --> 00:27:04,000
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other is right in the 160 it's</font>

539
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,760
not really used and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's two fish</font>

540
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,540
which is actually a good cipher later

541
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:13,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 128-bit block length is it would be</font>

542
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but why should we used to fish</font>

543
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:20,110
there is no sound reason for this it's

544
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:24,580
slower than other things we meet a lot

545
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:27,520
of co2 to implement this and so it's it

546
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:32,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't make sense Blowfish for obvious</font>

547
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:34,990
reason it's it's too old it's yeah arm

548
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,700
we should also duplicate the old

549
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,340
symmetric encrypted data packet this is

550
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,850
the data packet with off the DMDC so

551
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:46,689
without our own modification detection

552
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:49,449
code on this can be duplicated because

553
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:54,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the modification detection code is</font>

554
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:57,400
now in use everywhere arm yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

555
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,740
should also duplicate or version

556
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,350
the keys because they are based on now

557
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,330
and if md5 and they have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

558
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:09,389
other problems and so these are

559
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:12,990
basically the PGP two keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are yo que</font>

560
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:15,520
esto que already talked about this and

561
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,950
the last question is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font>

562
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:22,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">dig deeper Kate certain key sizes for</font>

563
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:27,670
example our keys RSA keys below whatever

564
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:30,070
or above fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> K or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think</font>

565
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:33,150
there is some stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can discuss</font>

566
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:36,250
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's are our</font>

567
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:39,160
people expect that implementations also

568

00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,760
really sense I don't I don't I don't

570
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,110
know and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is this thing where our</font>

571
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:50,190
stuff may break I it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> also be</font>

572
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:53,530
useful to think about whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

573
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:56,740
whether we allow arbitrary length of far

574
00:28:53,530 --> 00:29:00,160
as a keys because<font color="#E5E5E5"> some implementations</font>

575
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:04,900
can't can't handle arbitrary length you

576
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:07,060
soon um this is nothing we probably can

577
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,380
can discuss right right now here but

578
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:11,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is stuff for the mailing list to</font>

579
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:19,840
discuss this<font color="#CCCCCC"> are this point the last</font>

580
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:24,670

581
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:28,889
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old algorithms no um this</font>

582
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:31,120
tragedy a suggestion for the strategy is

583
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,100
that we have classes of duplicated

584
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,159
algorithms and parameter<font color="#CCCCCC"> barriers so</font>

585
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:39,669
there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a must not implement which</font>

586
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:42,900
is definitely md5 and the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

587
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:46,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need to have some are are back</font>

588
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:49,810
compatibility for we need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

589
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:52,980
decrypt our data so arm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

590
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:57,070
suggestion is to use must not produce

591
00:29:52,980 --> 00:30:00,190
but may consume data for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

592
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:03,120
Triple DES because there is existing

594
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:10,689
and it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> on may issue a warning to</font>

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,879
the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

596
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:19,750
if our something or just a crypt

597
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:22,750
decrypted of<font color="#E5E5E5"> not algorithm I and the</font>

598
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:28,630
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the old NDC packet</font>

599
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:31,360
or the sei s P D<font color="#CCCCCC"> are may be implemented</font>

600
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:34,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">I just think about on the previous slide</font>

601
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:38,350
um is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there anything else we could get</font>

602
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:41,920
rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like what are you leaving behind</font>

603
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:44,530
many includes and like camellias is that

604
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,260
widely<font color="#E5E5E5"> used or well I don't know whether</font>

605
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:49,480
camellia is widely widely used with its

606
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:54,220
only there for political reasons that's

607
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:56,890
my idea of it so it's no case I've it's

608
00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:03,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cypher we have it is so kind you</font>

609
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:03,240
could be huge as a fallback thing and I

610
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:10,600
I don't really care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can be</font>

611
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,940
here so so yeah I guess Marge everything

612
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,980
maybe when your when your break when

613
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,590
when this is brought to the list maybe

614
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,270
also include the ones that you're

615
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,570
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in behind so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people can say</font>

616
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:25,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could have that choice so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font>

617
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,710
a clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> view of what deprecation means</font>

618
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,750
in terms of the registry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font>

619
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:32,080
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful to say just to be able</font>

620
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:33,430
to concretely say here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we think</font>

621
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,830
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the columns that are going</font>

622
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to put in the registry and</font>

623
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:39,070
we think that these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> values for</font>

624
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">those columns for these for these</font>

625
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,280
algorithms right so that we have

626
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,540
something concrete to say because i

627
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,040
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of deprecation we're</font>

628
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,500
talking about for Triple DES here is

629
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,730
maybe for md5 as may be different from

630
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:53,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kind of deprecation we're talking</font>

631
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:57,700
about for for Triple DES right so like

632
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:59,740
the must not produce but may consume we

633
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,150
throw it out that we sort of have a

634
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,760
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between deprecated and</font>

635
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:06,520
obsolete so here we're saying md5 is

636
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,890
obsolete and others are deprecated which

637
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,889
means we don't recommend using them

638
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,660
anymore but they're still around so

639
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,250
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're iono registry proposal</font>

640
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,980
needs a slightly different set of

641
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:20,940
columns from TLS because<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

642
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to historical stuff to do</font>

643
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:37,459
maybe the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh ok here's re are here</font>

644
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:39,559
to profiles we we came up with so the

645
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one is called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the strong proposal</font>

646
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:46,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">arm what to do what what are mandatory</font>

647
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:53,000
to implement algorithms are the stronger

648
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:54,710
browser includes a idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher mode it</font>

649
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,799
has not yet specified we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

650
00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:01,340
which one<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will be but it is it will</font>

651
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:07,370
be a must then taking this a is 256 and

652
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:13,570
shall 545 12 ok and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

653
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:18,709
the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> on 82 5519 curve for signatures</font>

654
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:20,629
arm will miss them we miss the phone we

655
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:24,909
missed something we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

656
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:28,880
for encryption valve cousin so that the

657
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:32,179
255 19 or was it's called extra 250 19

658
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:36,080
which the logical extension for this for

659
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:37,640
encroaching on this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one proposal</font>

660
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,250
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other it seemed more competitive</font>

661
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:45,860
proposal arm which also includes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eid</font>

662
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:50,270
and but the lower key sizes for a fasn

663
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:53,779
fasha but also eros eros a that errors a

664
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:58,129
is the manager to implement algorithm so

665
00:33:53,779 --> 00:34:00,380
these are proposals murder can you

666
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:02,270
clarify if these are if the proposal is

667
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:07,130
to have both of these or if this if we

668
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:08,960
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose one uh yeah I think we</font>

669
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,560
should choose one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they are</font>

670
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,080
mandatory to implement and I don't think

671
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">it makes much sense to require</font>

672
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,619
implementations to implement both of

673
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:24,800
them so they're there are certain

674
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:27,409
reasons why for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shower 512</font>

675
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,490
is a good candidate even if it is slower

676
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:35,220
on embedded machines are because you

677
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:41,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to use this for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ED 2519 anyway</font>

678
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:43,138
arm well yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a strong proposal</font>

679
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,490
but if you ever want to have more

680
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:50,940
compatible with existing implementations

681
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:54,060
arm you could use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing but it</font>

682
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,030
doesn't it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> only work with your last</font>

683
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,220
3 item done because the aad is not in

684
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:06,000
any current implementation because it's

685
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:08,220
not specified so arm so is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just swipe</font>

686
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,650
any discussion about whether the MTI

687
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:17,279
profile should be forward-looking or

688
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:19,890
compatible my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> marcos ahoskie SES</font>

689
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,430
ji wanting to ask if there's any thought

690
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:27,420
been given to the use of quantum safe

691
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:29,580
algorithms for openpgp algorithms for

692
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:34,500
and protecting against quantum computing

693
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:36,540
that I no not yet so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any</font>

694
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,130
algorithm but this is also a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

695
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,800
the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> but above the edges with the</font>

696
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:44,849
registry that for exponent this can be

697
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,040
used then and while later keep you kept

698
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:50,520
on using<font color="#E5E5E5"> gun instead of using</font>

699
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,080
experimental code points for this but I

700
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:59,070
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's too early to put this in the</font>

701
00:35:52,080 --> 00:36:01,348
standard so it's still far so so they

702
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,810
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> FRG are also beginning to look at</font>

703
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:05,520
quantum resistance algorithms and so on

704
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,470
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I totally agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with our statement</font>

705
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be premature try and pick</font>

706
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">any such thing and provincial standards</font>

707
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:15,930
Phil Han Baker yeah we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font>

708
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:19,560
thing yet but I could easily see as

709
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:23,098
burning 50 or 100 code points while

710
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,720
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to an algorithm so</font>

711
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,550
we better get that registry thing

712
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:35,098
through now or else we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

713
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">regret it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hannah book but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> post</font>

714
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:39,450
quantum thing if we look at the

715
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:42,030
symmetric part of this if we choose the

716
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong proposal we basically have that</font>

717
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:49,050
already covered because as soon as you

718
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:52,890
go to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 256-bit security you have</font>

719
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:54,720
reasonably post quantum security so if

720
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:57,299
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be forward looking for</font>

721
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,160
postpartum security we could say if it

722
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,100
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the strong proposal that's there on</font>

723
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,859
the slide then we're already like

724
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,560
halfway done<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only the asymmetric</font>

725
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:09,780
part that has to be done then like we

726
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,190
could say we can keep the upper three

727
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,480
points even<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the post quantum future</font>

728
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:26,610
so is that that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a statement in</font>

729
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:27,900
support of the strong proposal yeah so

730
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,730
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind of a question for</font>

731
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,310
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what say if there is the</font>

732
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">one who choose the strong proposal what</font>

733
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:40,620
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people won't implement the</font>

734
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:42,540
compatibility stuff anyway I mean do we

735
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,680
have a sensor or will<font color="#E5E5E5"> their do we think</font>

736
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,200
there will be implementations that would

737
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,230
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the strong empty I stuff and</font>

738
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:52,529
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> never do what's our essay and so</font>

739
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:54,090
on well I can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that some</font>

740
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:58,940
JavaScript permutations would only use

741
00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:01,670
one one of the profiles but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know</font>

742
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:04,920
right it seems likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that new</font>

743
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:07,050
implementations that are looking for

744
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,440
what they'll receive would would accept

745
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:12,540
older stuff to be compatible but the

746
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,220
issue is what happens when they generate

747
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,950
things they're going to generate stuff

748
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:20,299
that older clients camp decrypt because

749
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:23,339
they they're using newer algorithm yep

750
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,700
but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we say that the mandatory</font>

751
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:28,830
to implement stuff is the comp at stuff

752
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,419
then there's no guarantee we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

753
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:33,870
move to the new Suites because<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one</font>

754
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">will ever done it exactly not quite a</font>

755
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:38,069
good because of the AI do if we say it

756
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,680
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> must yeah and we have we don't have</font>

757
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:47,070
it yet so it's not it is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font>

758
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:48,810
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your body versus tufa the</font>

759
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,850
implementations must be changing way

760
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,620
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now my vessel opinion would be</font>

761
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:56,549
just to go with whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> people write in</font>

762
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:59,100
code prefer so idea I'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you</font>

763
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,290
guys just decided to just let the kind

764
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of coders in this in this game kind of</font>

765
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,250
rule this one

766
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:17,190
ok we have a concrete proposal to send

767
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:18,540
to the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok the other thing</font>

768
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:21,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the fingerprint</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the fingerprints</font>

769
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:24,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kadri are based on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sha-1 edges and</font>

770
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:26,250
this needs to be replaced that there's a

771
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,290
second point of transformation<font color="#CCCCCC"> mitesh</font>

772
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,750
algorithm to use a router<font color="#CCCCCC"> user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

773
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:33,630
construct<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fingerprint and the other</font>

774
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:34,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> armed whether to include the</font>

775
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,170
creation time of the key into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

776
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:39,690
fingerprint on this has been discussed

777
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:41,370
on the mailing list of several times and

778
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:44,990
long threads whether to whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

779
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,990
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea it's not a good idea arm</font>

780
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:51,570
another point is that well that's more

781
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:54,299
kind of a remark that we can expect that

782
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:58,020
keys are larger than 64<font color="#CCCCCC"> K for post</font>

783
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,880
quantum and currently we for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

784
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,650
fingerprint rehash only a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2-byte length</font>

785
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,660
of the of the key so this needs to be

786
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:06,480
this should in any case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> extend it to</font>

787
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,640
24 24<font color="#E5E5E5"> by it so that we have something</font>

788
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,480
clear and don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drunk at</font>

789
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,950
something um ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the proposal here is</font>

790
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,170
something that we don't put the creation

791
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:26,819
time in into it on that we use sha-512

792
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:29,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">arbitron cated to 200 bits so we had a</font>

793
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,440
lot of back and forth and bike shedding

794
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:33,959
on the man list about the fingerprint

795
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,690
format and it never seemed to reach any

796
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,850
sort of conclusion so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

797
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">we move forward in terms of actually</font>

798
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:44,730
going with something except that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know</font>

799
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we want to move past the existing</font>

800
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:51,660
implementation so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

801
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:53,850
that can get us towards a consensus

802
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,020
would be great in my book but i'm not

803
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,020
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the right way to do that is</font>

804
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:09,150
I mean what what what what happens Steve

805
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,150
and I'll ask you as<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad what what what</font>

806
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:14,370
would happen if if there is no connect

807
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,610
if there's four competing proposals for

808
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:19,950
fingerprints and none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and no one can</font>

809
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:21,480
agree on them I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I</font>

810
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,669
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have decided that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want there</font>

811
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:30,810
to be exactly one format for a finger

812
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:33,390
friend / perky Virginia I feel hun Baker

813
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,470
well one way that you can resolve this

814
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:39,000
sort of thing is to add more

815
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:42,450
requirements until you constrict to

816
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,360
knock out candidates that don't work so

817
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:46,649
right if you if you have three people

818
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,140
who are saying well I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be like</font>

819
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:51,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">this because well I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it that</font>

820
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,379
way and then you have another person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

821
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,940
saying well I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like this</font>

822
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:57,900
because I would like the same

823
00:41:53,940 --> 00:42:00,690
fingerprint format for ssh and PGP and

824
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:03,720
s/mime and everything else that we want

825
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do then I think that that one should</font>

826
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,959
win because that's my proposal well

827
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:11,490
except that shns mom already don't have

828
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same fingerprints so we can't fix</font>

829
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:17,310
those things in openpgp working group no

830
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:20,640
but you can have a format that has a

831
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:22,320
Content that as part of the hash has an

832
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,129
identifier that's hashed into the

833
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:29,360
identifier like we do with and that's my

834
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:32,000
UDF proposal has that in so that then

835
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:34,680
different applications can use

836
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,910
fingerprints and you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

837
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:41,759
an ambiguity between them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font>

838
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:44,759
have a concrete rationale for my design

839
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,730
choices it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I prefer blue or I</font>

840
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,640
prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> red it's i think that the minibus</font>

841
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:57,510
should be white with a red cross on it

842
00:42:50,640 --> 00:43:07,830
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually an ambulance so</font>

843
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:10,410
you so your proposal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

844
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:13,680
explicitly actually some more stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

845
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,339
their with it was the key but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only hash</font>

846
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,740
as

847
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:20,010
and not put anything else in to the key

848
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,660
packet for this so implicitly we do this

849
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,580
though the fingerprints created for

850
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,990
openpgp are different for fingerprints

851
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,450
for and any other protocol because

852
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:30,689
you're the meter data what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchanged</font>

853
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:33,089
our anyway different but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just want</font>

854
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have the string open PGP hash with it</font>

855
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:40,080
I can't exactly remember the UDF<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

856
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,640
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just hazard another</font>

857
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,870
string so we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a couple</font>

858
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:58,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are with the with the key soup oh</font>

859
00:43:44,870 --> 00:44:01,620
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no problem with that sense and</font>

860
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:07,320
the rationale for using shower<font color="#CCCCCC"> 55 12 is</font>

861
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:11,700
on that we needed for<font color="#E5E5E5"> eg 2519 anyway so</font>

862
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:13,440
the implementation and yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is slower</font>

863
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,790
on embedded machines and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter Goodman</font>

864
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,310
doesn't like it for this reason but well

865
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:22,050
modern machines is actually faster so

866
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:24,509
it's for small implementation it's

867
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:29,850
probably easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use shot flattener 12</font>

868
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:33,630
and truncate it to a reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> size the</font>

869
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:35,549
only about the are the wire format from

870
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:39,000
the fingerprint and not about the human

871
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:41,010
representations so you stuck your thumb

872
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">up at one of that is does that mean you</font>

873
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,060
agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with his rationale</font>

874
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:58,840
totally agree I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> having 512-bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shah</font>

875
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,150
there are few other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I've</font>

876
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,580
done to make sure that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever need</font>

877
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:07,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">to rev the fingerprint you've got a way</font>

878
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:10,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">of reading that without expanding the so</font>

879
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:13,810
that if you use char three you can also

880
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:15,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">use those fingerprints as an alternative</font>

881
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:17,830
so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got an upgrade pack if you</font>

882
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:19,960
ever choose to need them as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

883
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:22,630
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> though if openpgp was to say</font>

884
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:27,490
we'll use your fingerprint must be sure

885
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:29,710
to 512 that'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine with me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

886
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,089
like backup algorithms but I like to

887
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">have exactly two algorithms for</font>

888
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,110
everything I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have one that I'm</font>

889
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use and one that I might have</font>

890
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:40,450
as a backup I do not like having three

891
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,919
so I think in ITF 95 there was a rough

892
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:44,770
consensus in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we wanted</font>

893
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,370
there to be exactly one fingerprint per

894
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:50,710
key so if you have a v5 key that there

895
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:52,690
should be one fingerprint for it so that

896
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:54,430
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give you a fingerprint you just had</font>

897
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:56,230
to compute<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fingerprint you're</font>

898
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:59,140
guaranteed to end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the same thing</font>

899
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:00,880
yeah so so having two fingerprints for a

900
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:05,470
single key seems to violate that

901
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,180
decision uh it will be entirely if you

902
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:11,649
want to have that absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

903
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:13,029
that yeah I I what I've been doing

904
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:15,730
strike weren't trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work out a</font>

905
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:17,680
profile that will allow me to use the

906
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:21,030
same fingerprint method to identify

907
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,950
roots of trust in different formats and

908
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:27,330
use the same fingerprint format and have

909
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:30,490
an happen how'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be unambiguous if</font>

910
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:33,850
openpgp wants to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're only</font>

911
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:37,240
going to allow the 512 the shower to

912
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:38,710
version that's fine with me other people

913
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,049
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a requirement for something</font>

914
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:44,410
else I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to future print</font>

915
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:46,900
improve the format so that if it needs

916
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:49,390
to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future I mean the thing</font>

917
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:52,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">is at some point it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible that</font>

918
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:54,450
shower too may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be deprecated and then</font>

919
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:56,860
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question of how do you</font>

920
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:59,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">distinguish between the old fingerprints</font>

921
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:01,240
and the new right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

922
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:03,140
doing is using to the shower<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 version</font>

923
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,819
because there isn't even

924
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,670
code that does shot three foremost so

925
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:10,340
that would be a V that would be a VL

926
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:12,860
compete EP v6 exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not specifying</font>

927
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,420
openpgp v6 right now you're not

928
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,370
specifying that right now but you

929
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,590
probably need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to say that</font>

930
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:22,790
you've got an upgrade path to v6 in the

931
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:26,440
future well there a problem of char to

932
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:32,270
you you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to generate new keys</font>

933
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:34,700
yeah so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem to change the</font>

934
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:36,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">keywords</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in then well yeah but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd</font>

935
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:43,189
still need to be able to distinguish

936
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:45,080
between the old and the new and we can

937
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:47,300
we can take that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on fire me you know if</font>

938
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:50,840
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the versioning issue</font>

939
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,640
differently that's fine and and if you

940
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,430
have specific text you want to propose

941
00:47:52,640 --> 00:48:10,040
on this that's I do have a draft yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

942
00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:12,350
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so post that so yeah phil has draft</font>

943
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:16,060
but I'm I guess what you're looking for

944
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:20,060
more as a pull request though right text

945
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">448 80s yeah yeah so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean I mean I</font>

946
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,120
presume field<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you're writing about</font>

947
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:24,620
but I need a generic thing and I not

948
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,750
specific piece of text that's needed

949
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:38,779
here I thought he meant draft text yeah

950
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:40,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">or was that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you the draft is</font>

951
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:44,630
already marked down so you can have

952
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:47,600
grabbed text yeah well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i prefer i would</font>

953
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,480
prefer to get it in as a div to the

954
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:57,650
current version<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can try and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

955
00:48:50,480 --> 00:49:00,020
out how to do that so I'm I guess if

956
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:01,400
you're asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tkj about how</font>

957
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:04,520
to decide i mean i guess one way might

958
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,140
be to say just pick a date and say the

959
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,030
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> options are those that have pull</font>

960
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:11,089
requests or whatever you prefer by the

961
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:15,110
taste and then just run a straw poll and

962
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:16,730
see what people prefer ok so again and

963
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:19,970
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end there are a couple of</font>

964
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:23,510
rfcs that offer suggestions on how to

965
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:33,830
reach consensus<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make alternative</font>

966
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:38,420
decisions yeah there's actually another

967
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:40,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">mic comment so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relaying for a derrick</font>

968
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:43,190
which i think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> derrick Atkins he says</font>

969
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,839
I believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the creation time and</font>

970
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,850
expiration time should be included in

971
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,350
the fingerprint<font color="#E5E5E5"> computation in order to</font>

972
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,150
prevent an attacker from taking my

973
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,860
public key and creating a new

974
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:54,710
certificate around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and causing</font>

975
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:56,300
confusion granted an attacker copy the

976
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:58,490
two times as well but then they cannot

977
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:08,090
modify the expiration time and maintain

978
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:09,649
the fingerprint so as a participant<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

979
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:11,480
will comment on this that currently the

980
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,680
expiration time is not actually included

981
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,030
in the fingerprint there is an

982
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,240
expiration time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the one</font>

983
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:21,260
that anyone uses as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell</font>

984
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,819
and they can take a given key if it's

985
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,460
someone has your secret key they can

986
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:30,230
reuse it in other places so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

987
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:32,120
Derek I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not entirely sure that that is</font>

988
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,770
a change<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the existing situation and</font>

989
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,600
I haven't heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anyone doing that</font>

990
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:37,930
kind of attack we don't have an

991
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:41,390
exploration time in the key is in the

992
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:43,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">same signature and it's an old proposal</font>

993
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:46,339
to put it back into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploration time</font>

994
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:50,780
back into the key packet because this

995
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:53,570
what the case in<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP to but the original</font>

996
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:56,840
before director the guy who proposed

997
00:50:53,570 --> 00:51:05,030
that L mean but has no interest in this

998
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:06,380
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all we discuss it so Derek if you</font>

999
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:08,120
have specific text that you want to

1000
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,020
provide along with an argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it if</font>

1001
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could send that to the mailing list</font>

1002
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:16,720
that would be good but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not seeing</font>

1003
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:16,720
much discussion on it here<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

1004
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:36,230
so moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so we have these mgc arm</font>

1005
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:39,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">modification detection code and this is</font>

1006
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:41,480
supported by a flag in the news in a

1007
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:45,940
special feature sub packet which has

1008
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:48,640
only the flag support MDC arm which is

1009
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:53,450
basically a preference that

1010
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:55,160
implementations understand MVC and to

1011
00:51:53,450 --> 00:52:00,589
advise other implementations to use the

1012
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:07,850
MVC feature arm for our the forthcoming

1013
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:11,180
a eid thing arm we would add another

1014
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:18,470
flag support a ID very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to md to</font>

1015
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:20,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">mbc arm but also for version 5 keys so</font>

1016
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:23,689
with the new fingerprints these new keys

1017
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:27,230
arm we would say must not use future

1018
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:30,500
packets because arm they should also you

1019
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:33,530
always use a EIG done because it's a new

1020
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,150
keys and for new kitchen is<font color="#CCCCCC"> need new</font>

1021
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:40,970
implementations and the new agreement

1022
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:43,940
ations can use the arm modern thing aig

1023
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:47,540
and then we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of the feature</font>

1024
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:49,040
sub packet which is well you can lose

1025
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:52,490
this very same with notation of

1026
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:56,000
notations rotations notation signature

1027
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:59,169
sub packets on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't see a reason</font>

1028
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,450
to have this feature package creep there

1029
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:09,140
so with version 5<font color="#E5E5E5"> case we could just</font>

1030
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:10,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">lock this feature sub make it so now i</font>

1031
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,220
see no comments on dropping the feature

1032
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:20,379
sub package so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just a</font>

1033
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:22,640
pull request<font color="#E5E5E5"> away oh yeah so um</font>

1034
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:25,940
authenticated encryption of additional

1035
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:30,950
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm there is a proposal they're</font>

1036
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:33,710
using a ESN in GCM mode and that's a

1037
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:40,250
concrete proposal for this

1038
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:42,440
other is to use OC OC b OC b seems to

1039
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:45,859
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with patterns for some</font>

1040
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:47,480
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we don't know so it's what we</font>

1041
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:49,970
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are pretty sure that we can get</font>

1042
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:56,510
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> exception for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this are similar to</font>

1043
00:53:49,970 --> 00:54:00,080
what rug of a gift for TLS arm there is

1044
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:02,540
also the option to allow both of them to

1045
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:06,920
have a flag which is supported them to

1046
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:09,410
have two versions and the other question

1047
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:14,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">is whether it needs to be streamable so</font>

1048
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:16,759
that or what is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> on an online</font>

1049
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:19,310
algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> are that he can can use it</font>

1050
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:23,270
streamable there are also some newer and

1051
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:25,460
developments so poet a set on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the LMD so</font>

1052
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:30,020
I myself don't know them exactly so

1053
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:33,619
that's arm that's all open for

1054
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:36,950
discussion now<font color="#CCCCCC"> or for long time what</font>

1055
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:39,470
what what to use so um my<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal</font>

1056
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:41,509
preferences of course OC OC p because

1057
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:44,560
it's a fascist it's the cleanest

1058
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:48,320
algorithm on but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to be some</font>

1059
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:51,609
pattern problems or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know so but</font>

1060
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:57,280
they're really province that's my ITF

1061
00:54:51,609 --> 00:54:57,279
our topic so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do with this</font>

1062
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,960
yes

1063
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:14,710
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not seeing anyone speaking up</font>

1064
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:18,309
around the particular any of the

1065
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:20,950
particular concerns here so is that G is

1066
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:22,420
the GCM proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a like in a poll</font>

1067
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:25,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">request form something that could be</font>

1068
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:31,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">merged</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't remember i only know that</font>

1069
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:36,309
chunk that implemented this in openpgp

1070
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:38,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">jas so we have one implementation yeah</font>

1071
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:41,700
that's not that's not really seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1072
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:47,859
but it's so summer free software thing

1073
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:49,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so this seems like maybe one of the</font>

1074
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:59,710
biggest outstanding questions that we

1075
00:55:49,299 --> 00:56:01,329
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I already already mentioned</font>

1076
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,980
this there's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the little</font>

1077
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:04,869
data packet which as a long-standing

1078
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:07,690
problem we have the file name in the

1079
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:11,079
little data packet are and the Phi

1080
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:13,000
creation time about you can't use it

1081
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:15,549
because it's not protected by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1082
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,230
signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's of course protected by</font>

1083
00:56:15,549 --> 00:56:22,480
the encryption layer but<font color="#CCCCCC"> our but you can</font>

1084
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:24,640
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> modify these flags also the the</font>

1085
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,490
file tech whether the binary or whether

1086
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:33,790
it's but the proposed new mime thing or

1087
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:35,979
text a<font color="#E5E5E5"> unicode arm thing that's not</font>

1088
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:39,910
that's not good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decision so the idea</font>

1089
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:42,309
is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a new signature</font>

1090
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:44,020
class<font color="#E5E5E5"> or signature class are the things</font>

1091
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:46,119
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have for signature class 0 which is</font>

1092
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:48,599
binary binary data signature class<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1</font>

1093
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:51,099
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a text from the data which</font>

1094
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit different is</font>

1095
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:55,329
complicated thing like a cannoli

1096
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:57,700
realization of line endings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

1097
00:56:55,329 --> 00:57:02,260
trailing whitespace removal and the

1098
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:08,828
things and the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define a new</font>

1099
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:10,690
signature class arm which I just ashes

1100
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:13,119
everything in the little data packet on

1101
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:15,339
budgets we would basically very easy or

1102
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,750
get a protection for the five major data

1103
00:57:15,339 --> 00:57:20,650
also 45

1104
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:22,570
thing and we could also protect the

1105
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:25,830
packet header so the Lang of the

1106
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:34,090
literature<font color="#CCCCCC"> tie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explicity be are</font>

1107
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:36,850
protected arm that's an idea so we're

1108
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:40,660
looking for a proposal for us if you

1109
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:43,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is useful at all I think it</font>

1110
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:44,950
says information and it is color<font color="#CCCCCC"> perisic</font>

1111
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:47,170
nation some of the information is not

1112
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:49,419
covered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> designator that's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

1113
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:52,810
to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar</font>

1114
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:54,640
to the unencrypted subject in males or

1115
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:56,680
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ama header that the armor header</font>

1116
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:00,940
lines which gives you some information I

1117
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:03,609
are just not protected so they are hints

1118
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:07,120
but some people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for strange</font>

1119
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:13,930
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and well it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be an easy</font>

1120
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:16,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to protect to protect us so is there</font>

1121
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:20,020
anyone interested in writing a proposal

1122
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:25,870
for this particular change should add a

1123
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:28,540
new signature class so i will i will

1124
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:29,890
post to the madness to ask if anyone

1125
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:32,950
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that but i'm not seeing</font>

1126
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:36,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone volunteering right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1127
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:36,779
an implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1128
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:52,169
so one thing that hasn't been brought up

1129
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:56,460
here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ed for 48 m this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

1130
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:58,950
the sides here so do you want to talk a

1131
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:02,820
bit about Ed 448 what the trade-offs are

1132
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:05,730
there Oh frankly a smart look I've not

1133
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:07,770
hooked into it in detail arm but we also

1134
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:11,359
need a new another algorithm for this I

1135
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:14,460
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the latest for this I</font>

1136
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:18,598
i'll definitely discharge often 12 is

1137
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:20,970
not enough for for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course and so</font>

1138
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:28,080
this goes hand in hand with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new hash</font>

1139
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:32,149
algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> also arm we should definitely</font>

1140
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,150
clear sign a coupon for this of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1141
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:38,300
home<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1142
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:49,430
so on no we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a coupon for this</font>

1143
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">because um for the elliptical curves we</font>

1144
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:55,580
use an object identifier for this that's

1145
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:59,210
easy but we would at least need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1146
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:00,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">indicate what do I need to use and put</font>

1147
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:06,410
it put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft right that is</font>

1148
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:11,020
changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rafter does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone know</font>

1149
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:15,529
whether there's already no idea of 44 48

1150
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:17,660
there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CF RG internet-draft 44 48</font>

1151
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:24,380
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think it's an RFC yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

1152
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:27,230
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just wait a bit we can I</font>

1153
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:30,349
mean you can edit the draft to refer to

1154
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:31,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">an existing internet-draft with the egg</font>

1155
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:33,920
with the assumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by the time</font>

1156
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:37,250
it's published we would we would it

1157
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,140
would need to be done does anyone here

1158
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:43,359
who's been following the CFR<font color="#CCCCCC"> G have a</font>

1159
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:43,359
sense of whether 448 will be done in

1160
01:00:45,490 --> 01:01:06,049
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok thanks runner so normal</font>

1161
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">question John that I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just talk</font>

1162
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,260
briefly about the PGP mine that's mine

1163
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:11,480
discussion that we had on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing</font>

1164
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:14,300
list about there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a proposal I think</font>

1165
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,950
about merging them I want to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

1166
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,380
I think as a chair this is probably not

1167
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:20,629
appropriate to do in this working group

1168
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:23,300
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's two things that p-gp</font>

1169
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:25,220
my man s my I'm do there's message

1170
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:28,099
formats and there are certificate

1171
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:30,618
formats if we're talking about message

1172
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:32,240
formats that's a separate RFC from 4880

1173
01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:34,580
we are chartered specifically with

1174
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:38,569
revising 4880 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to not get</font>

1175
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:40,520
into revising 3156 if we're talking

1176
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">about certificate formats I think it's</font>

1177
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,589
pretty clear that we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1178
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:48,440
adopt<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 directly within openpgp if</font>

1179
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:50,359
somebody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> propose text concrete</font>

1180
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,540
text that allows you to say derive an

1181
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:55,970
x.509 certificate from openpgp

1182
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,480
certificate or vice versa and that text

1183
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't</font>

1184
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,540
lay<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work of the working group and</font>

1185
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:01,160
it's something that straightforward to

1186
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,900
implement I think that's fine but I

1187
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:04,368
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we should be I don't</font>

1188
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:07,700
want it to distract from the revisions

1189
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:09,350
of the of the crypto that we're trying

1190
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get through so does that make sense</font>

1191
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,890
as to why pgp mind vs s mom is probably

1192
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:16,160
out of scope for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group at</font>

1193
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:17,270
the moment I'm not seeing any complaints

1194
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,680
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but I just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put that</font>

1195
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:20,680
out there to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's clear</font>

1196
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:27,020
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> objections or if you want to I</font>

1197
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:28,730
mean I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to talk more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third people</font>

1198
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:34,850
who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in discussing other</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ikuko mock mp's thing has already been</font>

1201
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:44,810
implemented by PGP and years years ago a

1202
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:48,830
description of what they use has been

1203
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:52,490
posted with it I'm hating this but we

1204
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:54,380
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have text for that in the in 48</font>

1205
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:57,100
abyss<font color="#CCCCCC"> write the description</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of how they</font>

1206
01:02:54,380 --> 01:03:01,930
do it is posted<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not there's no</font>

1207
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:01,930
none that no there's nothing in it

1208
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,848
I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that whole discussion was more</font>

1209
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,680
about recharging and not what we were

1210
01:03:18,849 --> 01:03:23,260
doing at the moment of the moat in any

1211
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,520
case I'm very reluctant to try to reach

1212
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:26,200
Artur the working group right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and</font>

1213
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:29,170
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had we've been slower at getting</font>

1214
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:30,520
just this one draft done so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

1215
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about reach our during that's a</font>

1216
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,220
separate conversation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really think</font>

1217
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:45,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a distraction from the work that</font>

1218
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:54,700
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are overdue on but so so I think that</font>

1219
01:03:45,849 --> 01:03:56,800
is that's the full scope of the stuff

1220
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had on the table for today so</font>

1221
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,640
we're a little bit on the early side

1222
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:04,630
that's good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had a question for</font>

1223
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">there now I see that you incorporated</font>

1228
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:31,779
bits have you looked at them I remember

1229

<font color="#CCCCCC">the only most their editorial things but</font>

1230
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:40,569
that's that's why we hold them for a

1231

revision of the document if the you know

group the verified ones are grouped
