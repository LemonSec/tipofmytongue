1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:18,050
so we get started it yeah small group

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">zone that's fine that's fine we can have</font>

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:24,100
a small a good discussion because we

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:29,380
need to there's work that needs to be

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,380
done anywhere someone as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

6
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,700
everybody can just yeah stand here a lot

7
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:45,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> regions are doing outreach you know</font>

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:49,370
India Latin America it was just over in

9
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:51,860
the Africa region<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing outreach so I</font>

10
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,860
think it's let's share information it'll

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:58,430
be I think good to have regional

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:00,980
mentoring I mean regions doing labs or

13
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,960
whatever other things draft review teams

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,048
and then come and then come back up

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,820
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's it's bet I think it's</font>

16
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:11,569
better for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know to have that and</font>

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,408
then centralized there's a lot of stuff

18
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:17,929
a bit that best practices I know um

19
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:20,479
region is doing a lot of things so if we

20
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:23,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">can coordinate I'll go I want to start</font>

21
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email list so that that we can we can</font>

22
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:29,719
keep in touch I'm also thinking with the

23
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:33,408
internet draft review teams um one thing

24
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:36,708
that might work is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the region's to</font>

25
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:39,499
coordinate that and you guys get like

26
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:43,279
two three<font color="#CCCCCC"> four people together and once</font>

27
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:46,789
you've got a core group<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works then</font>

28
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:49,990
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up because it's it's hot but what</font>

29
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:53,209
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we try to coordinate and</font>

30
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,749
somebody doesn't answer you know so if

31
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:58,249
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys have already pre-qualified if</font>

32
00:01:56,749 --> 00:02:00,499
you know if you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

33
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:02,539
you've pre-qualified the people who are

34
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:05,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested and you know I have these</font>

35
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:07,700
five people for this working group then

36
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,830
you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that does that am I</font>

37
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,319
making sense with any of this so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

38
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,640
a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> group so let's just talk but you</font>

39
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,970
know let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the microphone</font>

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,319
because what Harish said is that he has

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,150
some software

42
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,790
that what if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is recorded this is</font>

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:29,569
recorded he has software he can convert

44
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:33,260
so we have meeting minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i'm</font>

45
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:37,849
gilda company<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it make sense in fact</font>

46
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:40,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay i will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be i have some projects that</font>

47
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,980
may have some synergy on this ok let me

48
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:48,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">complemented this idea and I think we</font>

49
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:49,608
can we can have a nice resulting in fact

50
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but the thing that the tools are</font>

51
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:54,680
ready to do it such as to need to we

52
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:57,260
need to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them evolve think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,530
ready to to to be pushed or two to test

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,480
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> developed array and</font>

55
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,489
make them in bulk and see how it behaves

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,578
then I think they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two so to do</font>

57
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,290
this so you have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> project started</font>

58
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:11,419
already in your region is that what

59
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,150
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying let me think is that the</font>

60
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:18,919
tools to do for the lapse in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

61
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:21,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">so obviously i think first was we were</font>

62
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,379
discussing yesterday with<font color="#E5E5E5"> christian ok</font>

63
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:27,500
the blood<font color="#CCCCCC"> cold match here on one side</font>

64
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:30,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and there's a project an opium</font>

65
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,930
project called if I interrupt which that

66
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:36,828
project will be fit really on this side

67
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,199
and I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be objective of</font>

68
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:45,349
this very good yes I was at that that

69
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:47,180
that that that if the the IOT<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one yeah</font>

70
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:50,209
i was at that meeting to die think

71
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,400
that's very very good if after i do a

72
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,919
couple of my things harish is going to

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,509
talk about what's going on in india so

74
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:02,930
he can tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to three things there</font>

75
00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:06,018
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i am reached from national</font>

76
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,090
internet exchange of india and what we

77
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:12,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">are doing there is we are collaborating</font>

78
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:14,659
with the different universities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am</font>

79
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:19,279
talking about the eye I mean internet

80
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">research labs or so basically the idea</font>

81
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:27,109
is to you know based upon the internet

82
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:30,020
drafts or the you know best practices we

83
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,400
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know create the test</font>

84
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,680
beds to tattoo test

85
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:39,349
how it is working in watauga I mean

86
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,810
shortcomings<font color="#E5E5E5"> or limitations or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watauga</font>

87
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,169
advantage out I mean that test fine or

88
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,330
it is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working correct you know so</font>

89
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:52,340
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a clear criteria through</font>

90
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:55,729
the implementation the second is we are

91
00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:00,500
also planning to have labs throughout

92
00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">India so there it's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on IOT we will</font>

93
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:08,750
discuss it further<font color="#E5E5E5"> today with Karsten</font>

94
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:11,389
and on TLS on so that because a few laps

95
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,039
are easy to implement fewer you know we

96
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:15,710
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss among the community how</font>

97
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,840
to implement and these kind of things we

98
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">are planning and we are also moving</font>

99
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,929
ahead very enthusiastically<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me and</font>

100
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,930
you go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

101
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,919
okay yeah so like we were just talking

102
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,710
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been conversation with six</font>

103
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,500
slow sixth ish people and then also TLS

104
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:01,789
what we saw is let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's not go crazy</font>

105
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:05,120
let's do<font color="#CCCCCC"> two two things we focus on IOT</font>

106
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:07,190
TLS because one because I like like

107
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,729
Irish said there's a lot of work being

108
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:13,219
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT in IOT already and TLS is</font>

109
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:16,490
pretty easy and I've started the

110
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:20,030
connection with the some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

111
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,860
in the TLS group who say yes we can

112
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,068
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that you can test and</font>

113
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:29,840
then there's test TLS 13 server so on so

114
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:32,120
all that work is proceeding this is this

115
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,219
is all very experimental because there's

116
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,050
some questions people are like is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

117
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,750
going to take too much effort we don't

118
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,300
know but we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try because I think</font>

119
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:47,690
it's a very good way to bring new people

120
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:50,870
into the IETF and also please yeah fred

121
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:53,630
baker when you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on tell us what</font>

122
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:59,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">does that mean does that do do we bring</font>

123
00:06:53,630 --> 00:07:02,509
in Steve hunters problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> what if this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

124
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:05,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">a separate discussion well no not not</font>

125
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:11,930
quite yet what we mean by focus on TLS

126
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:14,840
is will have tell us 1.3 server till has

127
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:19,969
1.3 client and I'm actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

128
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:23,150
writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Wireshark dissector for TLS</font>

129
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:24,409
1.3 and actually tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us what is very</font>

130
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,409
good because we have set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

131
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:30,110
implementers email list where we can

132
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:32,810
discuss it was that was in preparation

133
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,000
for this kind of thing so we in the lab

134
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,360
we test it because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's two</font>

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">three prototype servers already we</font>

136
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,680
implemented NSS which is the one for

137
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:45,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mozilla you know we have that so that's</font>

138
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we can we can we can copy we can</font>

139
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:51,800
look at the Wireshark dissector we can

140
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:54,080
create a set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> P caps the he's what</font>

141
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,050
fred is referring to is there one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

142
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,950
people on another project i'm on has a

143
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,240
problem

144
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:05,840
with TLS 1.3 the problem he has is too

145
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,740
advanced for this lab so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

146
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,169
pure what does it work because<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

147
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:16,130
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think and you guys tell me if I'm</font>

148
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:19,660
wrong if one I if I'm reading a

149
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:22,580
specification if I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the packets</font>

150
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,370
maybe some people can go through the

151
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:29,359
specification understand perfectly the

152
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:32,720
protocol flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not one such if I i if</font>

153
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">i see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packets it's much easier for</font>

154
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,540
me to understand TLS 13 spec is 140

155
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:41,329
pages or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know so then</font>

156
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,669
I go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forth I say ah i see now</font>

157
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,250
what has happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the certificate</font>

158
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,140
can't see it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know ok so now i</font>

159
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,590
understand a little bit so I go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

160
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,290
read the spec because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is</font>

161
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,910
how then all of a sudden some clicks and

162
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,390
you go you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a hole right</font>

163
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,910
here in the spec that's but that's my

164
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,250
thinking and maybe you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me what</font>

165
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,100
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again if we have regional</font>

166
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,890
mentors who are working with these labs

167
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,320
working with the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody in</font>

168
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,020
that group goes yeah you're right there

169
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a hole right here so then you come up</font>

170
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,400
with something right to the email list

171
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:27,890
does this make sense to you at all what

172
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:29,900
I'm saying Oh actually of this kind of

173
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,430
lab setup I when we went to university

174
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,800
and students<font color="#E5E5E5"> were there they are doing</font>

175
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">the engineering projects and also they</font>

176
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,609
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more inclined to see what is</font>

177
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually happening through the wash out</font>

178
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,960
packets rather than going through 140

179
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,430
pages from first is to last one so it

180
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,720
will create<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interest you know lab</font>

181
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">setup and I know there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are so many</font>

182
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,910
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> associated to it but we all</font>

183
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">have in the community can give one or</font>

184
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:02,270
another answer and we can jointly move

185
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:04,790
forward I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think yeah at least that's</font>

186
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:07,640
that's kind of the vision<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

187
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,790
labs will help people we have the newest

188
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,069
versions of things

189
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and for me one of the very</font>

190
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,230
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things too is I wanted to</font>

191
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,600
write the wireshark dissector because if

192
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,060
you write the wireshark the protocol

193
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,580
dissector you understand the protocol

194
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,770
that's why I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write it and I</font>

195
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">think people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the labs too I mean you</font>

196
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,880
have so many students if somebody says

197
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i'll write the wireshark dissector</font>

198
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,650
for this piece of code you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

199
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,170
that's a very good opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn</font>

200
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,959
I also know that people at wireshark

201
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:52,540
very well and and they're very open oh

202
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:57,280
they can help too so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

203
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:59,319
have a irish if you would maybe you can

204
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,829
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some of the things you guys</font>

205
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,830
are doing in india so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

206
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation</font>

207
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:20,569
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the only one I can advance</font>

208
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:23,089
it yeah I know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's a PDF so so I</font>

209
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:28,880
just have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the next you tell me</font>

210
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:30,820
what screen is the next one most of

211
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,100
things are a very experimental

212
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:37,930
experimental and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> started it just</font>

213
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:42,560
to know what could be done to understand

214
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:45,560
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF in a in a better manner</font>

215
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,319
for the students and the faculty<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

216
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,020
working in the university so we have a

217
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,360
project called India IETF capacity

218
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:58,360
building program in which the idea of

219
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,490
IETF is you know main is to how to

220
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,160
implement the drafts and understand the

221
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,700
whole process so that is the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

222
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:14,350
behind it and this is more like the

223
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:16,850
practical implementation next please so

224
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,700
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Yokohama we had talked about</font>

225
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have some ideas regarding the lab and</font>

226
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:27,140
then we jointly I mean we have talked to

227
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:33,109
some universities so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

228
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:35,510
university I e IE st in seafood and dr.

229
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:40,040
jaya sil she is working on the NLP

230
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:42,410
project that is the to understand this

231
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,110
is related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a emailing list of IETF</font>

232
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:48,439
because in a working group in there are

233
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:51,080
so many emails so when our new person is

234
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,520
joining he would not able to understand

235
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,130
from where to start because there are so

236
00:12:52,520 --> 00:13:01,250
many questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> are linked list is very</font>

237
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:03,560
long so just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it easier for the</font>

238
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,950
new person there is a project that is

239
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,420
like natural language processing so now

240
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:14,750
work is started and it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the process</font>

241
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:20,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the example suppose there are</font>

242
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:22,330
so many you know archive discussion list

243
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,580
and there are so many of you know

244
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,250
threads inside it so from where to start

245
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,020
who answered what how to understand

246
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:35,800
things from the starting so that is the

247
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:37,569
main<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind the project so for</font>

248
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,579
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I atif main discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

249
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">scripted in which counts message by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

250
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:46,840
in center and this is not particularly

251
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:53,980
now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the version and please no</font>

252
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:56,200
process so now we have identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

253
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,150
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> area that is the question how do</font>

254
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,000
you decide when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an email in your</font>

255
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:03,220
box if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read it or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not so</font>

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,610
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main idea idea behind it how</font>

257
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:10,120
to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean relevant emails</font>

258
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:13,420
in this because there are so many males

259
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,120
or so many I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big thread inside</font>

260
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:25,270
the emailing list so from where to start

261
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:27,730
that is the main question and yeah so

262
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:30,010
again the secondaries when reading the

263
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">email list after the fact for any thread</font>

264
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,420
you get comment on comments on comments

265
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,940
it would be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in</font>

266
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,099
deconstruct the chain says the comments

267
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,630
were grouped by point within the topic

268
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,070
so that is how there are so many

269
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:51,189
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we are just you know</font>

270
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:54,040
constructing from where to start so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

271
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,200
this greater than sign is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

272
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,030
speaker and then response and response

273
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,280
to the response and then the latest

274
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment so now this this is how it will</font>

275
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,130
separate the you know different comments

276
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,320
in that emailing list so that we could

277
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,780
understand from where to start I mean a

278
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:17,370
new person who is joining the any group

279
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:19,810
or this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main idea so</font>

280
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:23,470
informational RFC spur IETF email list

281
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:26,229
archival we have used are planning to

282
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:32,320
use these RFC RFC six seven seven eight

283
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:33,699
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say seven eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four two so main</font>

284
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,049
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ID</font>

285
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,849
defied the area and scope of

286
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:40,149
experimentation identify the type of

288
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:45,699
group mainly you know a subject expert

289
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:48,910
and identify the implementation group so

290
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:54,459
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move further depending upon</font>

291
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:56,469
the requirements so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the action</font>

292
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:58,029
points identify the idea in scope and

293
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,889
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> this analysis through the neck</font>

294
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:02,470
natural language processing identify the

295
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,839
experimentation and this is the new

296
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:11,139
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> and algorithm depending now</font>

297
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:13,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the very it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now so these</font>

298
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the four action points identifying</font>

299
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,269
the mental group and identify the

300
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:18,309
implementation finally the

301
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:21,579
implementation what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is</font>

302
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:24,219
Nelly Jenkins with the doctor jaya seal

303
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:27,819
inandhra<font color="#E5E5E5"> j me and the group of people</font>

304
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,699
are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it so basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mail this</font>

305
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:38,319
is the whole new framework we are

306
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:42,639
started with so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the very wider</font>

307
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:44,559
idea about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this methodology how to</font>

308
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,660
define<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution domain then</font>

309
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,639
depending upon the implementation

310
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,858
develop algorithm and finally the

311
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:55,809
implementation this is the very garden

312
00:16:50,859 --> 00:17:00,699
you know generalized idea behind so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

313
00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:02,679
can skip<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one basically that is the</font>

314
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:07,688
again we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> explaining the each and</font>

315
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:13,000
every step so now the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is</font>

316
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:14,949
like how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know solution so that we</font>

317
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,750
can I mean we are walking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

318
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:19,299
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain email cuz clustering and</font>

319
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,720
summarization techniques and in itm 96

320
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:24,459
we will discuss you know more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll</font>

321
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,649
have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and authors looped in</font>

322
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,569
while work towards the draft so that

323
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:31,360
this is the just an idea I have

324
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:34,178
represented that how to start with any

325
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,490
mailing list and because there are

326
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,769
several threads inside it and how we can

327
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:44,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it better depending upon the</font>

328
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:46,870
discussion now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the idea of IOT</font>

329
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,300
lab for regarding that we are

330
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:52,959
connectivity to TRG research group so

331
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:55,510
that how labs can be implemented so now

332
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,420
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kaziranga</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> University campus we</font>

333
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,580
have done a memorandum of understanding

334
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,710
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kijiji onkyo is for the</font>

335
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:07,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kaziranga University for multiple</font>

336
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:10,540
activities the mentor is dr. beyond and

337
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,120
the focus area is how to make the whole

338
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,520
campus ipv6 enabled using the IOT

339
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:21,820
devices and this is the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind</font>

340
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:25,780
ah of this experimental initiative so

341
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:34,780
that is all about it so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

342
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:37,178
whole experimental thing so so thank you

343
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:40,389
so much Harry's what what I think as

344
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,480
good as is um so regions are doing so

345
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:46,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">much work if we can collaborate each you</font>

346
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,960
know have have them you know Latin

347
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:52,780
America India cooperation Africa you

348
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,850
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean all over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

349
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,309
very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> because and I think it will be</font>

350
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you guys have</font>

351
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:01,809
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work week we're doing this</font>

352
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,210
work do you want to help with us that

353
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:10,678
might does that make sense to everybody

354
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:10,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">too yeah so yeah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I let me see</font>

355
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:35,779
yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> then yeah this is you go Duke</font>

356
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:37,158
oven again well uh but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we involved</font>

357
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:39,590
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the indie development or</font>

358
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:42,950
experimental platform spiked with a long

359
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,289
time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put 60 or 70 years okay so the</font>

360
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,240
thing is I from the one side<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

361
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:50,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">explained that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there have been in the</font>

362
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,519
last 60 k they have been a little

363
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:54,590
revolution on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the number of</font>

364
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,740
facilities international facilities

365
00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:00,529
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> dresser facilities to to to to</font>

366
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:04,120
protest and to experiment because of a

367
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:07,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">first of all because of a</font>

368
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,779
research-oriented problem meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

369
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,000
you have to reproduce your experiment

370
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:14,870
some way in a political way that's what

371
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,049
the first the first idea we had over

372
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:20,090
there and the second that you can let

373
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:22,370
the people from whole around people

374
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:26,330
around the world in fact to test them in

375
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:28,250
a you know a variety of things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

376
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,399
have you over your hardware you offer

377
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:34,250
the interface you for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell and</font>

378
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:36,320
management interface in fact so they can

379
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">test your your things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your techy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

380
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,590
algorithms are our test your binaries in

381
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,350
different devices the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

382
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:49,668
there I've been working in fact on

383
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:51,428
wireless devices then from 802 11 to IOT

384
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:54,649
devices and the middle so that's why the

385
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:57,830
Hulk what type may experience on and I

386
00:20:54,649 --> 00:21:03,010
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already available gave us</font>

387
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:06,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">access maybe 100 nodes 55-200 knows it</font>

388
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:09,760
platforms and so on however um

389
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:13,340
lafourcade have their limitations and

390
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,460
another another way of thinking is just

391
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:20,889
to get um the platform in your pocket

392
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:23,510
meaning that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very a</font>

393
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:26,299
device which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more which are available</font>

394
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:29,360
and you can bring to your lap ok on your

395
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:32,750
you can you can reproduce this platform

396
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok in your lap okay without they come</font>

397
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,250
environment will you have in very big

398
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,660
platform but you can start there ok and

399
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:46,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">then scale</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of ideas okay so</font>

400
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:49,100
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that ok the the devices</font>

401
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,709
today we will advise it today you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

402
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,679
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok in a small scale and manner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

403
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> test things by yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

404
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,560
put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the availability for Amelia</font>

405
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:04,790
universities of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mary places so i think</font>

406
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:07,580
is other you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big development</font>

407
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,860
sites maybe installation killed and then

408
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,510
you have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> small platform you pocket</font>

409
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,010
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have three four five</font>

410
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,710
notes when you can test small into a

411
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:20,750
double interoperability on two sides on

412
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:24,830
this so d is not difficult in terms of

413
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:26,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard word to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok then however is</font>

414
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:30,320
available a hollow is commercially

415
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:32,690
available and and and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way talking</font>

416
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">about devices such as you two devices</font>

417
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:38,660
their standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok there you can test</font>

418
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,820
many things on them and when aside as i

419
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:45,260
mentioned before km side of platforms

420
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:50,260
and first two were no I hear about

421
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:53,330
called much they mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be ok and</font>

422
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,910
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to make synergy ok I get</font>

423
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,649
with the other the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> day feature up</font>

424
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,620
so that provides what you mentioned

425
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:03,710
before they it works directly on the on

426
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:06,169
the packet captures so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you have a</font>

427
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">111</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but capture from the one side to the</font>

428
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:10,280
other and says okay this works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

429
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,960
does not work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on so it compares</font>

430
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,540
all the time that I have a sequence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

431
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,880
things and this project has also some if

432
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,220
he drops has some advantages<font color="#CCCCCC"> net because</font>

433
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,450
it's starting now so they have some way

434
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:26,720
preliminary skeleton where things

435
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:30,170
working now to show that it works and it

436
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,320
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some resources for those who</font>

437
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:35,780
want to compete for resources you want

438
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,689
to extend this platform to provide new

439
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,460
test<font color="#E5E5E5"> Suites and to use the platform so</font>

440
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,440
they have to resuscitate for the

441
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,970
community case just to compete for them

442
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,500
okay and to say the best project will

443
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,780
win and have

444
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,820
to work on them so i think it's it's a

445
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,340
way not only to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that project but</font>

446
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:56,540
to offer it and make it useful for the

447
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:58,280
people hey what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm thinking is if we</font>

448
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,010
you know I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure other</font>

449
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,870
people have you know we we have all our

450
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:07,970
information in one place and other

451
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:09,800
people have to maybe we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> M the my my</font>

452
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,110
team you know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole edu</font>

453
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,050
mentoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> Directorate we're having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

454
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:17,449
meeting on Thursday so what I'm what I

455
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:20,750
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds good is if you guys agree</font>

456
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:23,540
is maybe we set up some webpages because

457
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,970
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think some things maybe they can be</font>

458
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,260
test web pages to start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font>

459
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,240
can't make them open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the community</font>

460
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,540
immediately because we probably will

461
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,820
make some mistakes start with and but at

462
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,879
least if we have consolidated you know

463
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:40,370
or at least parts of the wiki<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we</font>

464
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,140
start maybe with a wiki and say this is

465
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,790
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm doing</font>

466
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,570
because one of the things is like

467
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:49,580
because I that there's a with labs

468
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:52,280
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues you</font>

469
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:55,659
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like who if you open it up who</font>

470
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,430
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> login what if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a virus but</font>

471
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:01,040
but posting and yeah of course the same

472
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:03,980
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with posting binaries is like</font>

473
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:07,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody posts about a man opposed to</font>

474
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,040
binary there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> virus in it it gets</font>

475
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:13,010
downloaded is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ETF liable for the virus</font>

476
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:17,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that just got you know about that give</font>

477
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:20,870
it the point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh you posted but</font>

478
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:23,060
you're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future either your</font>

479
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,229
implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source mean that</font>

480
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,929
you're all you could provide yourself I

481
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:29,330
knew maybe you may compile it online

482
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:32,440
that's not for him this is a binary

483
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,850
choice is yours we are just you tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

484
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,610
discover it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> publish it</font>

485
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,500
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is it's yours it's yours</font>

486
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,969
yeah yeah we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the licensing</font>

487
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,950
but that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all that</font>

488
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:46,280
framework but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

489
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:49,490
because remote access and all that is

490
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,110
very tricky but I think what I like a

491
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,270
lot of those especially the getting

492
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,250
started with small device sure you

493
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:57,950
download you get on started very

494
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,210
exciting then you can post this was my

495
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,940
experience

496
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:05,779
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did that so the next person goes</font>

497
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:07,429
ha ok ok so then yeah and but I think

498
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:11,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think that makes for a rich</font>

499
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:15,679
environment to but so so my to do is to

500
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,260
discuss the collaborative the<font color="#CCCCCC"> web page</font>

501
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,320
or however we will do it and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal</font>

502
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:25,250
framework so that I ETF is in no way

503
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:28,010
liable if something goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong yeah so</font>

504
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:35,270
yeah but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think yeah ok ok but this is</font>

505
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:39,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">very good any any other so to think the</font>

506
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:43,899
two things so first of all the press

507
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:47,960
with made in<font color="#CCCCCC"> England markets i would say</font>

508
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:51,139
in the initial steps because we don't

509
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:54,289
know yet how's it going to evolve so we

510
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:57,429
are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> flexible so whoever comes with</font>

511
00:26:54,289 --> 00:27:02,379
an idea which has support idea without

512
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:05,210
many things our support it's just for

513
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,100
willing for them to success or something

514
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,140
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the seven collaboration</font>

515
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,360
between the different efforts that are

516
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:15,950
being started now like like they'd 0 NT

517
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,010
layers in our country's north america

518
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:22,010
and yours in in india will benefit chart

519
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:24,890
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> experiences and things to do and so</font>

520
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:27,379
we can probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> put them all together on</font>

521
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:29,929
a mailing list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer somehow so they</font>

522
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,840
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn from each other because not</font>

523
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:34,630
only six an empty it's a white patch it

524
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,520
so it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that each one it's</font>

525
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:39,770
doing their way yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have an</font>

526
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,658
advice for them we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any kind</font>

527
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">of support we don't provide any kind of</font>

528
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:48,919
equipment so we need to shape this idea

529
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:51,200
somehow and if we put them all together

530
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:55,039
probably that's going to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best way</font>

531
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,409
to do that and do mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit the cosmic</font>

532
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,129
tool it this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

533
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:03,649
them because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to document the</font>

534
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:07,039
decode they are trying on the labs are

535
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:10,340
implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and which ITF</font>

536
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,110
documents were used for that cold sure

537
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:16,189
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I encourage you</font>

538
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:18,350
to use it let me know if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

539
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:21,620
the we are not announcing it broadly

540
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:25,070
because we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a slow start mode we</font>

541
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to have some testers or initial</font>

542
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:31,639
users but the toolies done<font color="#E5E5E5"> reddit layer</font>

543
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's online so or wants to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's</font>

544
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,400
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than welcome so so yeah I think the</font>

545
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,240
email list so we can do the

546
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:42,429
collaboration I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

547
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,860
important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end in NM a</font>

548
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:47,870
website or a web page just to say this

549
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,969
is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this is being done this is</font>

550
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:52,520
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and people can start the</font>

551
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,280
conversation whoever is starting I think

552
00:28:52,520 --> 00:29:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and and that I think that's very</font>

553
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:05,480
good um I know um what I get a lot is

554
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,660
this is all very good but I ETF is not a

555
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:12,640
university our job is to do standards

556
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:16,340
and so in the end this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

557
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,860
there's a standard and we tested it and

558
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,649
or we implement or whatever and there's

559
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:24,020
a hole right here so it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

560
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,210
email list for comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that and</font>

561
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,590
there's not a benefit for the ATF it the

562
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,750
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are doing that in writing</font>

563
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:33,139
Americans that it helps us to engage

564
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:36,410
more people so it's more on the

565
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:39,049
diversity objective of the ATF and not

566
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:41,299
on the work itself that's why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

567
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:43,280
supporting sure sure no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think outreach</font>

568
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:47,120
is very important what is I think I was

569
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:49,370
talking in another another working group

570
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,500
I say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sometimes with IETF it's</font>

571
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:55,399
like if you have a house and the first

572
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,410
step is is five feet high and only the

573
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,590
people who can do a standing jump of

574
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:02,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">five feet and one can come in you just</font>

575
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:06,290
you need a few smaller steps and then

576
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,820
many more people can<font color="#CCCCCC"> can come in but</font>

577
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,590
it's just but as I said I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just under</font>

578
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying you from my perspective everybody</font>

579
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,280
says you know people say to me you all

580
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:16,220
you spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this time on this that</font>

581
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,350
where's the output where's can you show

582
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,240
me some metrics that say you know you're

583
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:23,330
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talking and you know but i</font>

584
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,880
think its<font color="#CCCCCC"> long term it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> term</font>

585
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,439
effort and it and i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

586
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,960
important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

587
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,730
collaboration between different parts of

588
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:37,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world that's also very very</font>

589
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:40,360
important so yeah I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

590
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:46,610
shocking we have consensus in this group

591
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:48,229
is a very select group so<font color="#CCCCCC"> and any any</font>

592
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:54,649
other things we should there is somebody

593
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:57,260
on me to echo but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not yeah yeah it needs</font>

594
00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:01,310
anything else should we have I see I

595
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:05,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know um I'm thinking we should</font>

596
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:09,250
have meetings at every IETF just to say

597
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:12,860
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our progress for some other</font>

598
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:17,120
projects what I do is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a monthly</font>

599
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:19,820
summary of what has happened um does

600
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,669
that seem useful to say just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say you</font>

601
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:27,050
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this month we have this and then</font>

602
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:30,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys around the email list um yeah</font>

603
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:34,129
Christian that's useful but I wanted

604
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:36,800
what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned a web page or</font>

605
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:40,160
something that can collect information I

606
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,350
can also offer we went through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

607
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,080
experience of creating a tool that it's

608
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:48,080
part of the tracker but it's not

609
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,899
official ITF like code much so we can

610
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:55,310
also help with some tool if it's

611
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:59,420
required to reserve document or whatever

612
00:31:55,310 --> 00:32:02,690
we may need with with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> labs or with</font>

613
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,520
anything else we have already the

614
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,800
connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the database</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

615
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:10,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">trucker's or we can extend or add</font>

616
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:14,080
additional applications without going

617
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:17,149
through the tools team and or the which

618
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:21,020
the develop it for editing that it's

619
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:26,960
faster and and we the small community

620
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:30,400
can create and support them the downside

621
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,860
it's that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to be a</font>

622
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,230
school that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is created an</font>

623
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,399
official from the teens tool it's

624
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:41,590
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's more</font>

625
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:45,090
product I mean yeah you start with

626
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:49,029
actually they will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it take that but</font>

627
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:51,309
in the meantime eats it works yeah no I

628
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:52,869
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's fine because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think may I</font>

629
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:54,789
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things you may have</font>

630
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:57,129
missed the thing about the internet

631
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:59,739
draft review teams because one of the

632
00:32:57,129 --> 00:33:01,809
problems we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is so many people sign</font>

633
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:05,169
up for internet draft review teams and

634
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:09,549
out of 5 you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end maybe only</font>

635
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:11,200
one comes to the webcast so so and and

636
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:14,230
we need I have somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's going to</font>

637
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,879
help do the code to match people already

638
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,879
so that I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

639
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:21,580
looking and then and that's so he can

640
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:24,158
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with but he can work together but</font>

641
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:28,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is if the region's if</font>

642
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:31,289
you already say I know I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two</font>

643
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:33,908
three people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very serious and</font>

644
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:36,100
then you send to me and then we match

645
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:38,799
them up with people from other regions

646
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:41,109
that will be very helpful because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

647
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,389
really believe in this draft review team

648
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:45,070
concept but I think that's you know

649
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:46,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">because because I think that's an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> app</font>

650
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:50,019
for regional mentoring I think that's

651
00:33:46,749 --> 00:33:52,960
another way to grow training you know

652
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:55,809
awareness the than the review groups and

653
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:00,549
then the labs I think let's not do more

654
00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:03,070
that already yeah that already is a lot

655
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:07,418
if we can show success that's why I say

656
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:09,609
show success throughout I'm i keep if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

657
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:14,139
get a very good contribution if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get a</font>

658
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:16,418
very good comment on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email list as a</font>

659
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:19,270
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of these review teams I</font>

660
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:23,859
like I know Edwin has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved with</font>

661
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:26,980
some and then then I send I send um to

662
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:29,409
could my<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have iesg you know is d of</font>

663
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,809
course the value you have to either you

664
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:34,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I can't just do like this I have to</font>

665
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:36,669
say what did at what happen so if i get

666
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:39,730
a very good comment i send up to them

667
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:43,058
and say look this you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this</font>

668
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:45,639
this new person commented and look this

669
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:48,490
is very nice and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people look at that</font>

670
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:51,800
that's because in the end our job is to

671
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:54,319
create very good standards so so that

672
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,450
just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't mind</font>

673
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,180
taking a long time not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean not it's</font>

674
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:00,980
not forever but it is not like a company

675
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you every quarter you have to show</font>

676
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:07,490
this is not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right attitude but a</font>

677
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:11,750
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> two years Indians something has to</font>

678
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:14,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">be very productive so I think let's I</font>

679
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,550
think the focus is good I like that and

680
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:19,370
i think frankly small team is much

681
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:23,140
better if there's a hundred people here

682
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:30,470
will never get anything done so good

683
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:33,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good it ever yeah thank you</font>

684
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,490

691
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:04,349
effort also going on in yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

692
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:08,839
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scenes it's like you always</font>
