5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,770
we were just some charter a few weeks

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago and this is a node node well if you</font>

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,180
are not familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it please go and</font>

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:36,530
read the document these node points<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:39,710
um so logistics we need a minute taker

10
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:45,890
um any volunteer we only need like

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:50,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level nodes and decisions any</font>

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:54,500
volunteer for a note you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it okay</font>

13

excellent thank you very much okay

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,760
thanks if we have a jabber scribe that

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,649
okay Jonathan thank you very much um and

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,560
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I i uploaded all materials and</font>

17
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:10,670
agenda to the ITF site so you can go

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,770
there and check it download it so the

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,359
agenda are we gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have two</font>

20
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,359
presentations jon<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be</font>

21
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:20,179
presenting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp draft and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan will</font>

22
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:27,679
be presenting the opportunistic security

23
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:30,229
trust any agenda brush<font color="#E5E5E5"> no okay so so</font>

24
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:33,200
before we we go to the presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

25
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:34,908
have a an issue with the milestone to

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,069
discuss so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to present it now</font>

27
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,840
if we can resolve it now we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

28
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:41,299
otherwise we can you know revisit it at

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,679
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the meeting so so these are</font>

30
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:49,729
our milestones which basically it's like

31
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:52,069
to submit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp draft basically and</font>

32
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:54,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">then the opportunistic security so the</font>

33
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:57,229
things like the second deliverable we

34
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,509
mark it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp and i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the</font>

35
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,520
opportunity security draft now it does

36
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:03,859
two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah which is basically</font>

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,780
offering secure all your<font color="#CCCCCC"> video profile</font>

38
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:11,060
instead of ya been<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay instead of audio</font>

39
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,640
video profile and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

40
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,230
something that is protocol mechanism and

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,959
probably should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> standard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> track and</font>

42
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,359
then it documents existing deployments

43
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,910
so

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,100
oh you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak or I was just going</font>

45
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:27,440
to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's marked as a bcp in</font>

46
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,400
the milestones<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no srtp because the</font>

47
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,550
responsible area director had to pull a

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,530
bunch of milestones out of his

49
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,230
uncomfortable places at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very last</font>

50
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute so those are not written in stone</font>

51
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,310
they're easy to change yeah that's a

52
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,930
good point so basically yeah we were

53
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,970
doing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tracker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process we didn't</font>

54
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really pay a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of attention to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font>

55
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,430
it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we we discuss it now and</font>

56
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:53,130
so then the question is yeah is it okay

57
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,410
so um option one would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know</font>

58
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,470
the milestones are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay option two would</font>

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,709
be to move the whole draft to PS and

60
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,720
option three would be to split the draft

61
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,420
into two parts basically one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

62
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,459
small draft defining the V mechanism

63
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,829
which would be standards track and the

64
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,840
other would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the other part of the</font>

65
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,270
document probably as informational so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

66
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,770
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get um II put on that uh</font>

67
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,450
John Peterson yeah Ella and I were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

68
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,040
discussing this and I'd almost I almost

69
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,958
think we probably need to talk more

70
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,190
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the documents because of exactly</font>

71
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the technical issue is with this</font>

72
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,700
before I would take home on this

73
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">question or we ever or try to get the</font>

74
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,100
consensus on it the issue again is that

75
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,840
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to have the behavior</font>

76
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,540
that we're recommending as a best

77
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,769
practice wherever that's going to live

78
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,780
incorporate the notion when you do

79
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,090
opportunistic encryption you do this

80
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,739
thing with a VPS AVP they're not then

81
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,600
that leap that needs to live somewhere

82
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,180
that is at least PS so we can point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

83
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,079
that behavior no one option I didn't say

84
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,340
in this that I'll and I were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

85
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,190
discussing it out this makes it any

86
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,480
easier would be just moving that into

87
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,510
the place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're going to</font>

88
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,548
specify that normatively into my

89
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,480
document into the zipper and ERG piece

90
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,500
set document but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think since L and I</font>

91
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,060
was having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of heated</font>

92
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,820
exchange about this before the written

93
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,810
group even started in some sense i<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

94
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,180
sure people understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

95
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,769
specific technical issue is before we

96
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,720
talk about her about it yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

97
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,220
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce youth now but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

98
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely okay discussing these at the</font>

99
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">end of the station so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Reacher oh yeah</font>

100
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm happy to discuss this in as well but</font>

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,940
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I agree that the stuff about</font>

102
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing employments is not really</font>

103
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,300
appropriate if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this</font>

104
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">in bcp</font>

105
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,970
um definitely not appropriate if its PCP

106
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,310
even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's PS like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it can muddy</font>

107
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,650
the waters as to what the cases I think

108
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,970
splitting it somehow like wherever the

109
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,650
pieces of land I think splitting it out

110
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,960
somehow seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a good idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I'm</font>

111
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,900
on you want to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

112
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,609
yeah Alan Johnson um my understanding

113
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,080
when when said randy was chartered that

114
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,520
we were having two documents one about

115
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,229
comprehensive security and the other

116
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,490
about opportunistic security right they

117
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:01,909
are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely different approaches</font>

118
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,370
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think if if we stick with</font>

119
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:07,159
that and if other people have the same

120
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,289
expectation as I did on that that you

121
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:11,300
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will that will work and will</font>

122
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:14,960
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can avoid things like number three</font>

123
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:20,210
there I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think number</font>

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:24,469
one makes sense at all Oh srtp could be

125
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:26,930
PS but if if that changes what it says

126
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:29,479
then then that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> acceptable because</font>

127
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,250
opportunistic security is is what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

128
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:34,430
we have an RFC that defines what it is

129
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:37,639
that had wide consensus here in the IETF

130
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,250
and and we're just publishing how to do

131
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,139
that with srtp so I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

132
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,400
decide this now but but we do it we

133
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">should try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to by the end of the day</font>

134
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,840
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so somebody else wants to</font>

135
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,400
speak now as opposed to later when we

136
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,440
will decide these or I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

137
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,940
actually going to ask about or comment

138
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the milestone to the previous slide</font>

139
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:05,690
okay yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh this one I didn't get it</font>

140
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:08,500
all because the opportunistic srtp draft

141
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,000
is really what i would hope is the least

142
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,159
controversial and what is already

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,759
deployed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't see why that would</font>

144
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:21,590
take a year or more to do ha ha ha<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

145
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,110
other one is one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I so so this</font>

146
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,369
currently deployed on to be here I mean

147
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,110
the controversies it's not about

148
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,719
documenting is whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's</font>

149
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,779
documented for you know informational

150
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:33,620
reasons or is you know normatively

151
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,569
recommended or it's you know how we

152
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,710
document it so yeah but that's that's

153
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to affect the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timescale</font>

154
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,388
hopefully so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can understand why that</font>

155
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,149
wanted that one the first ones in<font color="#E5E5E5"> March</font>

156
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the next one's in November's oh you</font>

157
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:47,430
mean the order<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay know that I mean</font>

158
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,099
we can change that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an issue</font>

159
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:56,520
17 is far<font color="#CCCCCC"> too long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that drive right</font>

160
00:06:50,099 --> 00:07:02,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay sure um sure um so Robert you want</font>

161
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:07,710
to say something before we know yeah

162
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:09,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's 2017 is what it is okay so Andy</font>

163
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,120
what one comment on that which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

164
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,340
think we understand bcp here in the

165
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,740
particular context of her past being a

166
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">pcp in other words when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say is your</font>

167
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,599
best current practice and purp as we

168
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,940
know it is aspirational right in a sense

169
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,469
of there is a current practice that we

170
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,810
think there's a practice that we think

171
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:29,490
is best for us currently and it is

172
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,830
treating pervasive monitoring as a

173
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,810
threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the internet and purpose was</font>

174
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,280
passed as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp with that form that's</font>

175
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,900
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit different than</font>

176
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,309
documenting what the reality is on the

00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">ground the round on the ground is not</font>

178
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,210
much security right looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind</font>

179
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:44,490
in any of this stuff and yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

180
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,799
utterly can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alan like that the</font>

181
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,539
implementations he's describing are you

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,979
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that in places that other</font>

183
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,139
things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not then providing some</font>

184
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,599
security in those contexts but do

185
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,550
understand bcp here in those terms in

186
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,750
the terms of there's a problem and the

187
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">best way we know how to address that</font>

188
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,389
problem right now is what we're

189
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,860
documenting in this not what the reality

190
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:07,440
is on the ground yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yum please I</font>

191
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:12,630
can drive these for you or that should

192
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,969
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay welcome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pink box</font>

193
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we're going to talk about the</font>

194
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:22,469
recently renamed document sip brandy RTP

195
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:25,169
sec next so Gonzalo asked me to just go

196
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:27,000
over again some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the material that I</font>

197
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,109
presented at the dispatch working group

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,699
that I have some things to say about the

199
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,870
new revision of this just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

200
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,000
people who are joining us<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the first</font>

201
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">time get a sense of what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,659
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to accomplish here so we</font>

203
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,409
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify those best practices</font>

204
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:41,429
again in that specific purpose sense

205
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,099
something that will hopefully influence

206
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,540
both implementation and or policy one of

207
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,370
the really interesting side effects of

208
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,140
making something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PCP instead of a PS</font>

209
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,029
potentially the most interesting side

210
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,579
effect is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is something we can</font>

211
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:56,130
say outside of the ITF represents the

212
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:57,510
ITX consensus call you should do we had

213
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,010
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small problem with network management</font>

214
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,580
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years ago where there was a</font>

215
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,050
versa

216
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,670
service providers who were lacking some

217
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,250
traffic and people came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the ITF and</font>

218
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,050
said is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay or not really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font>

219
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,240
thing we could do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to testify</font>

220
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,310
for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an FCC on bunk about this was</font>

221
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,840
to hold up<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pete's say this BCP</font>

222
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,209
says you shouldn't do it you shouldn't

223
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,560
do it that way so think about that

224
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">document is something that we're going</font>

225
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to influence implementation but</font>

226
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,470
also influence policy with this as we

227
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,850
talk externally about what all this

228
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:29,070
means um next next level so it's a

229
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,510
two-prong strategy and I think this this

230
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,950
is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the points where I were that</font>

231
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ellen and I are feeling around right now</font>

232
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,520
so let's be clear we're talking about

233
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,740
that what I propose to do in this

234
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">document is to very explicitly show to</font>

235
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,250
forking paths I'm not just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

236
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,080
like one document that says here's a way

237
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do comprehensive protection and then</font>

238
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bloods ever will so</font>

239
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,610
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the plan today Ellen you're</font>

240
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,200
welcome to try to persuade us otherwise

241
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,450
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's that's inappropriate</font>

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,240
the idea now is to have two strategies

243
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,980
and for the most part my document merely

244
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,770
says deferred<font color="#E5E5E5"> Allen's document for how</font>

245
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,090
to implement the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategy and</font>

246
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,590
it's only going to be again in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

247
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,300
cases of what ends up being like

248
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,860
mandatory to implement like cipher

249
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">Suites and things like that that I think</font>

250
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,940
we may have some friction that we need

251
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out here today but the basic</font>

252
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,600
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we're gonna try to reuse stuff</font>

253
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,479
that's in stir as we know stir is an

254
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,340
attempt to do an RFC was called RFC 4474

255
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,340
piss again in a slightly more tractable

256
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,740
fashion some some cooler and braver

257
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">minds than myself injected themselves</font>

258
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,460
into this discussion I think we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

259
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,710
really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> place with industry in this</font>

260
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would call out Chris went and the</font>

261
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,310
great work that he and I have done on

262
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">passport and so on I could get that into</font>

263
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,280
a much more interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> shape one of the</font>

264
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">things it really does better than</font>

266
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,290
binding identities two keys that's

267
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,550
really what it does in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did you</font>

269
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,109
originally the 4474 had a much broader

270
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,700
scope of protection it turned out that

271
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,840
that was really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not compatible with</font>

272
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way that service providers were</font>

273
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,110
operating their networks we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

274
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,880
has a much better chance of just getting

275
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,630
that binding between identities and keys

276
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,830
I mean yeah otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're</font>

277
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,930
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should do what's in the</font>

278
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,510
opportunistic security draft because we

279
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,589
say yes should do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular practice</font>

280
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,010
in this and it's that one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">offer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AVP rather than s AVP that that is</font>

282
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,379
a normative behavior that we are now

283
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,238
allowing that was

284
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:17,429
previously disallowed in others are

285
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:18,899

286
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:21,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though they were not previously</font>

287
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,519
allowed to do that and this is kind of

288
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:24,959
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lynchpin of where Ellen and I</font>

289
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,529
are feeling around how to organize this

290
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,669
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes where so my my poses I at</font>

291
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">least need to be able to point to</font>

292
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:34,049
something normatively and because the

293
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,639
way ITF specifications are structured a

294
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">bcp need to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to point to</font>

295
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,749
something that is at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> PS say that</font>

296
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:40,889
that's why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have these slides we were</font>

297
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:43,019
just showing you about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to organize</font>

298
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:48,269
the milestones but<font color="#CCCCCC"> how in please do Alan</font>

299
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:50,899
please Alan Johnson um I disagree with

300
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:54,449
the bullet that says that that the only

301
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:55,979
important thing is the AVP<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus sav</font>

302
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:58,258
pol<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right that that's not the only</font>

303
00:11:55,979 --> 00:12:00,119
thing about opportunistic security

304
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:04,079
opportunistic security is about relaxing

305
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:05,639
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's</font>

306
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,549
telling you not again I'm telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

307
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,649
do some specific normative behavior that

308
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:13,019
is allowed this specific point again is

309
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,999
something that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a normative</font>

310
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,979
statement that says that implementations

311
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:19,350
can do that merely relaxing i mean we

312
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:21,389
relax i denne already right I mean it

313
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,249
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling us not to do something we</font>

314
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:24,600
already are allowed not to do is not

315
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:27,089
something i need to normatively point to

316
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,409
that statement that single thing is the

317
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:29,669
thing that's different enough that we

318
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:31,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to be able to say implementations</font>

319
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:33,899
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I disagree with</font>

320
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,089
well know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so explain but you</font>

321
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,970
disagree that we shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

322
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,470
2.2 us to a standard strike statement

323
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,879
that is doing that or you are saying

324
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we should go beyond that</font>

325
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:48,389
no I'm okay with perhaps with

326
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:51,600
normatively pointing to the

327
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:53,669
opportunistic security document you know

328
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,339
when when we open it up and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

329
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:59,100
and see what that entails then then it

330
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,709
may change<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I I I disagree with the</font>

331
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,309
statement that the only thing you need

332
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:07,799
from my draft is that you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer a</font>

333
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:09,809
VP and and still<font color="#E5E5E5"> do key that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the</font>

334
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing in it well I'm again I'm not</font>

335
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:13,169
Saints the only behavior and if it's the

336
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">only normative behavior that we disallow</font>

337
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:18,569
now I think relaxing authentication on

338
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:23,299
on your keying is is a pretty major

339
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:23,299
thing but what

340
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:29,849
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely that's is that that's the</font>

341
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:33,690
basis of opportunistic security it you

342
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,820
keep the confidentiality opportunistic

343
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,040
security with its art its art<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

344
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,829
refugees my draft doc telling you can

345
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,199
use the mic yes my draft has always said

346
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:44,819
that since 00 it says you relax<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

347
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,589
authentication otherwise it's not

348
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,699
opportunist<font color="#CCCCCC"> Huxley's explain that a</font>

349
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,560
little more weight by you relax the

350
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication like what specifically</font>

351
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,939
are you saying your job tells you to do

352
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,850
not use digest way to me what was it

353
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,050
telling about it means doing things like

354
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,360
like not having an end-to-end

355
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:04,920
authenticated signaling channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font>

356
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:08,070
compare the dtls fingerprints right the

357
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,019
dtls srtp documents says you must have

358
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,620
an end-to-end authenticated signaling

359
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:15,120
channel to compare the fingerprints well

360
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cycle that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's it that if</font>

361
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,920
that's what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about that's</font>

362
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,060
the really that's one example<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay these</font>

363
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the examples we need to tease out</font>

364
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,439
the set of things you think are

365
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,579
behaviors that were not in you know that

366
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,380
there are currently disallowed that are

367
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,880
allowed by your documents that's why we

368
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,860
need under<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cesar these are the things</font>

369
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,139
that define opportunistic security and

370
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,500
my document describes how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply the</font>

371
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,720
principles of opportunistic security to

372
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,220
srtp but and let's let's also make sure

373
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the elephant in the room it is in its</font>

374
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,730
which is what the algorithms are right

375
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,709
is that if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a PS documented</font>

376
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,540
security is how you negotiate it's not

377
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,399
what you negotiate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

378
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,319
quote from the opportunistic security

379
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,740
RFC that covers this that we can that we

380
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:57,990
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to later again we are gonna</font>

381
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,190
discuss it<font color="#CCCCCC"> later yes yes and I wanna get</font>

382
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,959
through these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I just want to make</font>

383
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,490
clear though that I think one of the

384
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,630
elephants in the room is is that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

385
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:08,639
US r QP draft is PS it still<font color="#CCCCCC"> legit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

386
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,079
says you can use s desk right which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

387
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,569
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my document is</font>

388
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,439
normatively disallow so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

389
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:15,420
the things where I think we're going to

390
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">get and again that documenting that</font>

391
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,240
there is a deployment where you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

392
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,500
doing that is reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> provided its</font>

393
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,510
informational it's not we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be</font>

394
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,579
putting forward as a standards document

395
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:26,850
here at least in my proposal yeah um

396
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:28,620
John<font color="#E5E5E5"> please yeah John Watson yeah my</font>

397
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,139
understand is this that this is

398
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,360
high-level scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to point or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

399
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,600
point to multipoint think that should

400
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably point it out in the document so</font>

401
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,589
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

402
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,140
related text that's in the document I'll

403
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:47,300
get to that in a couple slides yeah but

404
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:50,060
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they is is that the only</font>

405
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,219
solution for Paris that the specific

406
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,660
point to multipoint so at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

407
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,550
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm still collecting requirements</font>

408
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,660
right now again I think I am hearing

409
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,310
acquire people wanted you point to

410
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,600
multipoint for this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> perk would be an</font>

411
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,040
example of how to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's</font>

412
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,120
a best practice we can get consensus for

413
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would like to point you in a document</font>

414
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,540
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to be clear so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

415
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay keeping on discussing that right</font>

416
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,360
point-to-multipoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I have</font>

417
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,970
another slide about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then we'll</font>

418
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,560
get later yeah Colin please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i'll</font>

419
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,329
come back to point to multipoint but i

420
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,800
mean i think is it you know what the

421
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:20,569
really formation of this was trying to

422
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,760
weed weed really move things forward web

423
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,370
WebRTC security and we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font>

424
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,620
out how to to do something so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

425
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need a draft the talks about the</font>

426
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,160
a VPS AVP thing I could care less if

427
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,360
it's that draft or another one where you

428
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,899
know we're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of individual drafts at</font>

429
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,100
this stage um and you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

430
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,480
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the point that what we're</font>

431
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,220
mirroring there is what's already done

432
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,440
for WebRTC we're just reflecting that

433
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,779
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle into in to see I got</font>

434
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,050
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that too not sure thank</font>

435
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:49,459
you um yeah Arik Air Patrol um so I

436
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,990
don't want to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a semantic debate</font>

437
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,040
about opportunistic means ever does not

438
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,360
mean but it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that from a</font>

439
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,620
technical perspective there are author

440
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,920
these two properties which one might be

441
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">a curse to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them one property is on one</font>

442
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,270
property is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the property on the ellen</font>

443
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,680
alluded to namely um that you don't

444
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,639
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> think at the end at the end</font>

445
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">points others the property that you</font>

446
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,380
discover whether or not the other party

447
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,750
is capable of doing um sue calm security

448
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,480
on but for potentially fall back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

449
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,640
security appear unable to and so on to

450
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:25,209
give you to give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example of that</font>

451
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:28,429
um uh you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think maybe um</font>

452
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:31,360
apply some<font color="#CCCCCC"> the HCP htp we talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

453
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:34,250
you know uh you know maybe connecting um

454
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,479
attempting to connect with HTTPS and see

455
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,100
if it works and it wasn't work you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

456
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,020
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess it didn't work and it does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

457
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,879
but they may be justification so I think

458
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's um you know that there are</font>

459
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,040
two properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't be interested in</font>

460
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,800
and um and and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're</font>

461
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,300
distinguishable and separate and i said

462
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,149
i wanted to bait with hopper to succour

463
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,280
not but I

464
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,450
guess I be I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buying</font>

465
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the property and it seems to me that</font>

466
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,680
that under many conditions about you

467
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't buy the property that uh they did</font>

468
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,590
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> establish security you have an</font>

469
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,000
authenticated channel but it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

470
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">case you probably saw where security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

471
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,380
and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that that's precisely</font>

472
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">in fact what the with the RTP AVP thing</font>

473
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,000
is about is being able to offer offer

474
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:15,659
security on but not a fierce I will be

475
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,690
all except it yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay young gentleman</font>

476
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,450
x<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm and possibly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple respond to</font>

477
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,430
this maybe I mean so I mean I've

478
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:26,870
extending that I don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a</font>

479
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,800
problem with say having the

480
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,879
opportunistic security grafter<font color="#E5E5E5"> wherever</font>

481
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to call it also might have</font>

482
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:37,110
certain terminology say must do satp but

483
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:39,659
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp say don't it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other way</font>

484
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:43,649
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think well these are a must</font>

485
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:46,470
must you must sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> estes which is a SF</font>

486
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,670
EP not detail ssap yeah the question is

487
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,380
is there gonna be a standards track

488
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,060
document the ichat that says you must do

489
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,710
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> desk with this plan that we even</font>

490
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">really gotten to that yet right but i</font>

491
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,730
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a problem</font>

492
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,000
early i think maybe maybe you have to

493
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:02,880
get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2119 language right but having</font>

494
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,300
one document say you know encourage you

495
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,740
know just as you know I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I want</font>

496
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,879
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall I know I want to use security</font>

497
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,110
would fall back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Dale security I you</font>

498
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,510
know I want to use good security will

499
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:15,120
fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad security if necessary</font>

500
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,860
yeah so I'm is indeed what this right

501
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,020
see this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say good to bad i</font>

502
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,229
think this this is good too well I'd say

503
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask about security yes I'm willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

504
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,230
say that but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still probably still</font>

505
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,480
better than no security and I might I

506
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:31,040
would rather fall back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at the</font>

507
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,320
discussion that yeah we should be having

508
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay moron yeah Eric I'm sorry I just</font>

509
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,080
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just one of them make 100 on</font>

510
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,879
it I think um<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allen's alluded that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

511
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,550
on the requirements are for details<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sgt</font>

512
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,560
provide and in signaling security but my

513
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,570
reading the drafts as it just he

514
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,030
confirms about the case um we of course

515
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,290
encourage you to do so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um sips is I</font>

516
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,670
mean it's like even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't do</font>

517
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,500
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of worthless but on</font>

518
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,610
but likes it but sips is certainly is

519
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,400
there is certainly within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope of</font>

520
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rough yeah of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of course you</font>

521
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,010
know we've already see we've course not

522
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,540
frightened is it was good yeah yeah

523
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeahs something to keep in mind these</font>

524
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:10,370
like this is a one hour

525
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:12,439
so yeah but that was exactly my point

526
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,760
what let's be honest that this is I

527
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">think what we need to resolve so I am</font>

528
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,930
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time on this yeah</font>

529
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,939
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's try to but just to</font>

530
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,500
keep in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way um there were a</font>

531
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of new people coming so if you can</font>

532
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,240
pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue sheets again that'd be</font>

533
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,460
great thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you yeah please go ahead</font>

534
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,320
sure so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to go into too</font>

535
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">much of this tutorial information here</font>

536
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,879
we are doing stuff with<font color="#E5E5E5"> port of course</font>

537
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,560
NT for this basically what stir creates

538
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,970
an environment where there is a sip<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

539
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Andy called an authentication service</font>

540
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,520
that is responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assigning sick</font>

541
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">requests that creates that finding</font>

542
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,750
between the identity and the keying

543
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,760
material in the request and that will be

544
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,640
caught by verification service which

545
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,900
will perform a comparable function the

546
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,920
way that still works that says it can be

547
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,350
implemented at endpoints are

548
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,210
intermediaries typically today and most

549
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,159
use cases we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> ferster people are</font>

550
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,880
signing it at intermediaries so we are

551
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,750
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

552
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">different here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks one of the many</font>

553
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,600
headaches<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stirs design</font>

554
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,479
that makes this an interesting problem

555
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,810
is that stir only<font color="#CCCCCC"> signed sip requests</font>

556
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,010
you cannot sign sip responses and of

557
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,139
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way we typically think of</font>

558
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,420
offer answer where you send I an offer

559
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,400
in an invite and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer in a</font>

560
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,870
200 ok therefore is not the way we would

561
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,280
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> establish</font>

562
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,310
some kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like bi-directional</font>

563
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,590
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> association using stir instead</font>

564
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:30,080
we need to use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like L wells of</font>

565
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,970
49 16 connected identity which allows

566
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,889

request after an early provisional but

568
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,570
this creates a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

569
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,070
interesting timing tweaks and questions

570
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,600
about exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the King material</font>

571
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,189
becomes available now as we will see

572
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,330
this is exacerbated<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're considering</font>

573
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,580
one of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting use cases</font>

574
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,649
which is gate waiting to WebRTC and

575
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,169
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get like end-to-end a TLS to</font>

576
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,970
work through that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've</font>

577
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:56,360
really ever tried to figure out how that

578
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,740
works before now and as we're looking at

579
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that for the first time we recovering</font>

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:04,280
all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attention see interesting</font>

581
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:06,140
edges on next time um yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah right</font>

582
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,149
the algorithms obviously one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

583
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,220
major concerns that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this in</font>

584
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,410
the initial version of the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

585
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,360
indicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> appropriate for</font>

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,900
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp to indicate a mandatory to</font>

587
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,649
inspect our algorithm for this and let's

588
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,290
face<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

589
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,420
mean of things that we have as standard

590
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,649
algorithms here in the ITF it seems

591
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,460
pretty unlikely we would do anything

592
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:29,990
other than<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SP for that this would</font>

593
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,790
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a time since what we have in the</font>

594
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,500
draft down there is a must for DQ less

595
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:37,639
creepy and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a for doing</font>

596
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else including see RTP right</font>

597
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,400
so we do we do disallow access

598
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:45,820
explicitly um so I have very<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong</font>

599
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,280
feelings about just allowing estás um

600
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:51,590
if positive or negative ones know if

601
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,300
Tess is not really all that much more

602
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">insecure than the other thing it changed</font>

603
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,960
you trust all the servers right instr

604
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,400
you trust all the identity servers it

605
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,660
changes the set of servers you have to

606
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,280
trust but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's set of servers you</font>

607
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:07,340
still have to trust so what I'm

608
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:12,920
interested in is getting to turn off and

609
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:14,600
what I'm but yeah so that the bones are

610
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,750
see some dignity<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus privacy button</font>

611
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,360
so I want us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to one thing that's</font>

612
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,010
widely implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and our problem of</font>

613
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,659
having multiple options in this has just

614
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,210
been a disaster from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning so I</font>

615
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,980
don't mind deprecating SS as long as

616
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,920
we're getting to one thing just one

617
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,690
thing right so one thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some maize</font>

618
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,090
over here or something not working for

619
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,450
me I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> on board if it's going to be</font>

620
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,889
made for other stuff it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like do this</font>

621
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,510
because it introduces constant

622
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,610
complexity of we have to keep designing

623
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,410
for all these different systems that we

624
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,000
see over and over again and no one

625
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,620
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends up building any of them some</font>

626
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,780
people build this some people build that

627
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,120
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to say what the ITF</font>

628
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,610
recommends is a best practice is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

629
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,199
may a best practices we it's either best

630
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,719
practice or not may is not the best

631
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,820
practice so again we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say</font>

632
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,280
that we think the best practice is using

633
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">duty less srtp but just as I said</font>

634
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a kind of a two-pronged form</font>

635
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,189
with this right yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I think we</font>

636
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,750
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community in the</font>

637
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,430
world a disservice if there was a

638
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,410
significant implementation base of z RQ

639
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,330
p and we believe that it is securable

640
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,300
with these techniques and that it's

641
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,699
better than nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a hard time</font>

642
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,850
seeing us really disallowing but this

643
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">please room up um you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a hard</font>

644
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">time seeing us is allowing that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so to</font>

645
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,210
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear culling sorry you are saying</font>

646
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see a must and</font>

647
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,380
must not know I must<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's it I'm</font>

648
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,610
not not mention anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

649
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,310
there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing if you want to</font>

650
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,020
say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must do detail us ends at RTP we</font>

651
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,730
could have a discussion about that but I

652
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean there's we should say what you must</font>

653
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,420
do in this and that should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be our best</font>

654
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,120
current practice and that's it I'm keep

655
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,460
silent about anything else yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok um</font>

656
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,639
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not protocol</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> police right</font>

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,690
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric yeah I don't wanna sit on calls</font>

658

661
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,500
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposal called I understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

662
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:08,090
to is to have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details</font>

663
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,830
sister DP you must be hella sleepy and

664
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,040
nothing else it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font>

665
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,210
reference to the or srtp draft um what

666
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,470
do you want the<font color="#CCCCCC"> content to those are Pee</font>

667
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,990
draft to say and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you want this</font>

668
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:20,510
to say about that referee<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonder same</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">internal transitive closure case as I</font>

670
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,440
understand it wait on what's the

671
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,179
interaction of what we end up mandating

672
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,860
in this with eos<font color="#CCCCCC"> r QP draft so he's a so</font>

00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,900
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understand it John tends to</font>

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,669
normally normally reference the OS RTP

the entire closure of the time graph has

00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:48,290
this a VPS AVP hack that you can use for

any<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of our keying protocols yeah and</font>

686
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,860
could say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> i implement that draft for</font>

00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">mikey and it specifies it and you're all</font>

688
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:07,490
nice and happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think</font>

689
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,080
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp says is for whatever chosen</font>

690
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,270
King protocol we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> which most likely</font>

691
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,250
detail SSR to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know for the</font>

692
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,290
for the protocol it's our best

693
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,390
recommended practice the way you do the

694
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:20,899
opportunistic is the way specified in

695
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:23,780
that other PS draft and I don't see any

696
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:26,890
problems with that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean largely</font>

697
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:31,129
solar said is what we do right um uh

698
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:33,590
yeah again the questions are if that

699
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,330
document is PS and it says you can do

700
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,459
ask desk then you're fine with that I

701
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,560
mean that documents just talking about

702
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,180
how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh srtp in a variety of</font>

703
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,850
protocols the ITF is published in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

704
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,190
past right it's not saying what our best

705
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,620
practices<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm again yeah</font>

706
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,029
I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> said resistant that as a pass so</font>

707
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:54,590
if there's no resistance as pathum we

708
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:57,080
can do it so to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear it's Aang's if</font>

709
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:58,428
you happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing as this this is</font>

710
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,580
how you would do a proper tuning

711
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:03,919
sticking em security yeah the other

712
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,509
venture I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the other</font>

713
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,279
document which would be a PS strength

714
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:08,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">doc right would say if you're doing</font>

715
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,620
Mikey you do it like this if you're

716
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,580
doing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> LLL ask you do it like this</font>

717
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,870
if you're doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are to be you do</font>

718
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,240
it like this for doing estás you do it

719
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:18,408
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it just checking that that</font>

720
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:25,720
everybody understands what you said yeah

721
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:29,330
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so I'm John please go ahead</font>

722
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,509
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if people go with that then I</font>

723
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,428
think Ellen is this so Alan I mean a

724
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:35,570
where I use enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz this is our</font>

725
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:37,100
important question for dad yeah yeah

726
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,870
like a question of what could we week we

should<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend time on that Alan yeah but</font>

728
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,969
I mean we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide until we get to</font>

729
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:46,279
my document<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> house now is not the</font>

730
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,470
right time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be deciding what goes in</font>

731
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:50,179
my document or not in my doghouse yeah

732
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,149
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> journal of course start going</font>

733
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:54,590
inside is not his document i right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

734
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:56,000
you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying let's</font>

735
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,039
find a document with the properties<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

736
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">justice yeah okay I mean to be clear yet</font>

737
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:03,259
document currently has that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean Alan</font>

738
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:05,090
I mean the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want you to answer</font>

739
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:07,490
is like the general approach of saying

740
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:11,178
if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use these do that is</font>

741
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:13,039
that acceptable or not so so Sean dinner

742
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:15,580
from Jabbar says I can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on board with</font>

743
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,350
Collins approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks hon chan</font>

744
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">Allen places what Colin described is</font>

745
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:24,639
what my document currently says okay

746
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:27,080
yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you um John John Watson</font>

747
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:29,779
reading current document I understand

748
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,990
that you must implement stir but don't

749
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:38,419
use it and you must implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> sotp btls</font>

750
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:42,169
srp and use it is that I don't think I

751
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:43,700
think it only says must implement it may

752
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:46,250
be on the terminate inside that you

753
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,230
actually must act as an authentication

754
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,049
server on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the orange side I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can only</font>

755
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">find implement also i think this these</font>

756
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:54,168
are very earliest facts here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

757
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:55,369
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah get-get at the spirit not the</font>

758
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:56,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">letter A Lot this point we're trying to</font>

759
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:59,629
sort out what we think the design spaces

760
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,559
though yeah but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's which of</font>

761
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:02,629
these is

762
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,639
things that you must implement which of

763
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:05,899
these so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually just I recall</font>

764
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:08,059
in the last section of my document now

765
00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:10,459
is that you must implement the stirrer

766
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:12,620
client endpoint profile that is defined

767
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,299
and it is the intention even if it does

768
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,350
not articulate a properly today that

769
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,759
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means you implement both the</font>

770
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication service and verification</font>

771
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:22,120
service functions in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end point yeah</font>

772
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:25,700
but implement doesn't mean necessary use

773
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,049
okay well don't write book and also John

774
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,710
to be clear you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are saying that he</font>

775
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:32,840
should also say that you must use it

776
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,999
seems logical I also think you mentioned

777
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,100
answer what what do you do if the other

778
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:39,649
if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terminator side doesn't support</font>

779
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,049
DJ LSS ought to be and what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do if</font>

780
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:44,959
you get an offer that doesn't have dtls

781
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:47,539
srp and so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best current</font>

782
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,309
practices is you don't worry wait yeah

783
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:50,360
well we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that again I'm trying</font>

784
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure out we've got like a right</font>

785
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,600
fundamental building blocks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

786
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,860
we'll a lot more get up the thumbscrews

787
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,469
actually locked down with the behaviors

788
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,229
yeah um common realistic calling it a

789
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,970
point that got me up was not to do with

790
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,289
Alan's draft it was to do with your

791
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">dress I think we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

792
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:08,240
see it recommend one thing at a must

793
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,559
level right okay we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that I mean</font>

794
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">what what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was clarifying and that this</font>

795
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,200
exchange for me was again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's people</font>

796
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,480
seem to feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

797
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,039
Ellen's draft eps and be normally for

798
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,360
your reference for this purpose and well

799
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:19,369
if we were going to it that whale and

800
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,789
then really i will say very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

801
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:23,749
about this other<font color="#CCCCCC"> than like you know your</font>

802
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:25,700
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> security is what's in that</font>

803
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:27,019
document over there and if you can't do

804
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,450
this do that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have that</font>

805
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:31,789
statement though right as long as you're

808
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,659
protection if you got it if you don't do

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything we do have remote parties I</font>

821
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,269

822
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,020
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna deny dit now until we</font>

823
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:15,960
talk about what's in my document right

824
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">I please it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do consensus here</font>

825
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,500
let's let's talk I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going for a ham</font>

826
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,360
I'm just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the sense of the</font>

827
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,710
room yeah Thank You<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan so right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

828
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,060
what I did is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your 01 I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're</font>

829
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">still collecting requirements as we</font>

830
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,700
started talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this people here</font>

831
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,680
with work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ascot what about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multipoint</font>

832
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,880
right well should there be some story we

833
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,830
have that is going to interface this

834
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,510
with with perk or something which we do

835
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,520
what should we say about b2b ways

836
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,960
largely we were talking about endpoint

837
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,180
behavior and this is it worth having a

838
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,670
reference in there to 78 79 that talks

839
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,650
about ways to be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be ways might behave</font>

840
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:48,330
theoretically in some alternate universe

841
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:49,800
for BB<font color="#CCCCCC"> UAE's listen to ITF IOC's so we</font>

842
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,840
have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of plugs in for things</font>

843
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,520
like that there's a warning<font color="#E5E5E5"> about sip</font>

844
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,230
rack and about the fact that basically

845
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,850
you know if you send this meeting to an

846
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,620
end point that can decrypt it who knows

847
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,669
what that input will do with it and are

848
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,229
there are limits to what we can

849
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,450
practically achieve with confidentiality

850
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:05,190
and set we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit better text</font>

851
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,570
about in anonymity and the store

852
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,580
interaction in that you get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

853
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this come on come on it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sooo know</font>

854
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,540
it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the right time to comment on</font>

855
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:15,030
purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think I do I know your</font>

856
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,370
slide from brown ya mean go ahead go

857
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,720
ahead go ahead go ahead no I don't

858
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,979
actually so come in oak creek now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

859
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,510
so I it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just seems to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that though</font>

860
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,940
solving a conferencing situation be

861
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,830
highly desirable we're still very early

862
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,900
on that stage we don't know what we're

863
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing yet and I i would rather I'd</font>

864
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,700
rather see this proceed with just making

865
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:38,399
the stuff that we know well work and

866
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,380
worry about the type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> perk situations</font>

867
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,770
a little bit farther down the road so

868
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you would be kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of um you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are saying</font>

869
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:47,310
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would like to see</font>

870
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:49,320
point-to-point face first and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

871
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:51,570
but let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person if it then</font>

872
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,250
turns out we know how to do non

873
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,050
point-to-point situations maybe we take

874
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,220
that on but initially i think we're

875
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,720
gonna have enough problems just getting

876
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,730
simple things yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> perc has a lot of</font>

877
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,950
purpose language and its<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter and so</font>

878
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,210
on as well so I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it we could</font>

879
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,650
view that as just an extension of this

880
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,710
general mandate to get purpose to work

881
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,540
well set designer Erik so I I always go

882
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:12,210
out so yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I generally agree</font>

883
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,470
calling on this per point I'm no one is

884
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,540
more enthusiastic about<font color="#E5E5E5"> perk than me</font>

885
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,630
well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone is but I'm gonna give</font>

886
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:20,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fun but on i'm actually more</font>

887
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,110
concerned but the milestone cases that I

888
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,790
think it's reasonably like the purple

889
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">not be finished by the time so I I'm</font>

890
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,559
happy if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find some women we've</font>

891
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,580
induction of pork and how it's like

892
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,570
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we should be doing I'm</font>

893
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,189
like totally happy to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

894
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:32,499
don't want to do is be happy you know

895
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know March or whatever it is</font>

896
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:35,710
have it be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> work isn't done yet and</font>

897
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,090
now we're like just stuck sitting behind

898
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:39,279
it right that's apartment hard to avoid

899
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,330
um so if there's some way to thread that

900
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,009
needle I'm perfectly happy with it but

901
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's I think my guess is Brooke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won't</font>

902
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:49,120
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done for another year or so</font>

903
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay Andy so so I'm now just</font>

904
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,580
express a little bit more caution on

905
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:57,279
that I think actually there is some

906
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">tight coupling between this and perk at</font>

907
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,129
least in that as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i sip endpoints</font>

908
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:03,789
because then it has to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

909
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:06,369
initiate both without knowing prior

910
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:07,690
knowledge of what recession is going to

911
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:11,319
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether it's gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a multi-party</font>

912
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point-to-point so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't rush</font>

913
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:18,940
too far with the basic perkin this work

914
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,619
has some points online so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are saying</font>

915
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,480
so you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that if we fixed a</font>

916
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,669
point-to-point case and then we start

917
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,440
working in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-point case we may</font>

918
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:28,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that we should have done things</font>

919
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,490
differently for the point-to-point place

920
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:32,440
this is that that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a possibility i</font>

921
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:34,479
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> there must be around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in some way</font>

922
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,560
so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think is a likely possibility</font>

923
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,149
or yeah I mean I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in this</font>

924
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,679
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andy that responsibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

925
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:43,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">evolve to perk right i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is what</font>

926
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,639
what effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would mean as long</font>

927
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,949
as perk accepts that as a responsibility

928
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,859
is nothing in the Charter says these it

929
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:53,319
must be aligned<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that can be fixed</font>

930
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:56,409
yes it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fixed okay thanks um</font>

931
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:58,869
recheck yeah I spent a bunch of time in

932
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:01,630
boss this week and I think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

933
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:03,040
clear well scope problem here with just

934
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,690
covering point-to-point like I think

935
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,670
perk is significantly different enough

936
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,410
that it makes sense to handle it

937
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,910
separately if we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

938
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,098
separately like if it logistically works

939
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,359
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it together fine we can put it</font>

940
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:14,920
together but I don't think it's a big

941
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,930
deal to treat them separately either I

942
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,849
think we can do this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> park and you</font>

943
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,578
know take whatever solution we do there

944
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:23,740
and anoints it as as bcp later um and

945
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:25,270
cover that case in and to the point

946
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,770
about sip endpoints<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

947
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,170
actually completely within the realm of

948
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the design space right now that there</font>

949
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,190
wouldn't be actually that much

950
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,200
difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we would be</font>

951
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,690
proposing here and what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do in</font>

952
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,430
dude from the end point perspective to

953
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,510
do part so I think there may not

954
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,850
actually be that much too

955
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">24 perk ultimately it may just be you</font>

956
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:48,610
know go over and do this thing over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

957
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:51,040
okay yeah I'm John<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yamato also simply</font>

958
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:53,260
I'm supporter of concentrating on<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

959
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to point having perk might require more</font>

960
00:35:53,260 --> 00:36:01,360
than yesterday below encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

961
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:04,029
actually work so it what the minister

962
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,560
factory will be reppin that out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

963
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:08,410
other things on here seem reasonable

964
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:11,950
again anyway look for the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

965
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:13,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">flipboard again thanks right so we are</font>

966
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,669
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is effectively a</font>

967
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,560
profile i think for using stir where we

968
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,760
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints reacting is both</font>

969
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,700
the authentication service and the

970
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,520
verification service the hard edge on

971
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:28,270
that of course is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> certs and so</font>

972
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,190
we have some text about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> now i guess</font>

973
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:32,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">i am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now starting to sketch out in my</font>

974
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,720
head what the acme use case for this

975
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,400
looks like both for using an acme task

976
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,230
to acquire a cert for a telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

977
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,280
and four green fields of your eyes and

978
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,890
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not work that we're</font>

979
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,280
gonna complete in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

980
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:50,950
timeline either so yeah we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

981
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,570
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> argos will be done in acting yeah so</font>

982
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,589
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a consequence we're gonna have</font>

983
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,460
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aspect friendship</font>

984
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,440
perspective how we're going to approach

985
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,370
that right now I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just we're</font>

986
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,630
just saying there's going to be a way

987
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:00,810
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're gonna be able to get certs</font>

988
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:04,330
one way we are in described next slide

989
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:07,180
is basically using some kind of a

990
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,350
self-signed sir and this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

991
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,230
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like I'm the opportunistic</font>

992
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:12,940
approach to stir where you'll have a you

993
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,830
know a self-signed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keith who at least</font>

994
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,240
give you trust on first youth kind of

995
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:19,660
properties and that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

996
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,660
benefit to this that goes beyond you

997
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">know just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing nothing at all so in</font>

998
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:27,580
this case that Justice I have my head on

999
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,020
the BSF sign sort that would um that I

1000
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,880
would then affiliate with the phone

1001
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:34,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they thinking apparently</font>

1002
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,500
came in on ya in that tofu way and I

1003
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:40,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's like slightly better but</font>

1004
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,470
I'm certainly when people tell me that

1005
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,360
they don't think that's slightly but i

1006
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,399
think it's slightly better no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1007
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,780
tofu is<font color="#E5E5E5"> John phonics I don't know I</font>

1008
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,820
think dropped off was automatic sorry I

1009
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,530
think tofu is a you know a reasonable

1010
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,420
property you know again if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

1011
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,829
anything better but I assume would stir

1012
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,989
be specifying this

1013
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:57,190
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is its initial is that in 45</font>

1014
00:37:55,989 --> 00:37:59,859
hours 34 bits or is that going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1015
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:01,539
this is in this is enough so i put in a

1016
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:03,700
bit in 4474 businesses don't rule this

1017
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:05,170
out in other words the point of our site

1018
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,848
for mrs. full of lots of language that

1019

say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you</font>

1020

matter of local policy whether you

1023
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:15,488
decide to accept a credential or not and

1024
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:16,809
its scope of authority and<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1025
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:19,479
you know what the certificate has to

1026
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:21,309
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is in scopus term like</font>

1027
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:23,229
it needs to have an its identity and all

1028
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:24,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the Turner he he helped</font>

1029
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:25,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">us with that and that's all something</font>

1030
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can just lift for a straight</font>

1031
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:28,119
here we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know will they</font>

1032
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,979
refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean is are there</font>

1033
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,299
like specific like I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how many</font>

1034
00:38:29,979 --> 00:38:32,979
different modes these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't</font>

1035
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">folds for that closely yeah well we</font>

1036
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:35,769
would have to go through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify</font>

1037
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,329
what exactly is before the TN cert

1038
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:41,200
especially that would that would be

1039
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:43,420
complex but we'll do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll do it right</font>

1040
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't you wanna get down slides I</font>

1041
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,450
know one of the things that's come

1042
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:47,618
through that scare me<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that we</font>

1043
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,749
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the first time trying to figure</font>

1044
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:51,459
out really<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to align the and n</font>

between web urgency and & M<font color="#CCCCCC"> sep on this</font>

1047
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,118
this is the first time I think we've

1048
00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:00,759
really taken a hard look at that that's

1049
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:03,940
why you know how Adam wasn't it raised

1050
00:39:00,759 --> 00:39:06,039
said I'm here oh yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> see um consent</font>

1051
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,809
right as a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of something</font>

1052
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:10,239
that we've never really had a place in

1053
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:12,729
sit where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we asked you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do I style</font>

1054
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:16,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">consent as we do in where Ricky see and</font>

1055
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:19,410
it does seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to belong here so getting</font>

1056
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:21,849
the timing of consent and ice and

keying that comes in these different

places in stp potentially that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wooden</font>

study and we make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's right I'm</font>

1066
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,979
know I I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's real</font>

1067
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:40,808
problem but I do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure we</font>

1068
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:42,249
really understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that we have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a plausible story about how this work</font>

1070
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:46,629
with existing web RTC implementations or

1071
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:51,039
potentially if you know there needs to

1072
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:52,900
be some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a delta good um so what</font>

1073
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,549
do you guys think I mean given roughly

1074
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,900
what we're discussing here is this you

1075
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:58,119
know I don't know given how the

1076
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,670
discussion is gone if we want to talk

1077
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">about adoption of items yet definitely</font>

1078
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,549
use more eyeballs I've been glad to get

1079
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,289
a fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of eyeballs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the spec</font>

1080
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:07,660
already though not much<font color="#E5E5E5"> less discussion</font>

1081
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:09,549
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure there's no require</font>

1082
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,049
sir missing right things like the perk

1083
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:12,549
thing came up and we're now going to

1084
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:14,049
take that off the plate that's cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1085
00:40:12,549 --> 00:40:15,520
suspect there could be other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1086
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:17,020
education as a corner cases people are

1087
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,520
interested in if so let's circus them

1088
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,900
because once we think we've got the

1089
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,190
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to operate on here we'll</font>

1090
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">get out the thumbscrews and we'll really</font>

1091
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,630
say what that endpoint profile means

1092
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:28,709
what the interaction with<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is he</font>

1093
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,700
looks like and so on are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so um</font>

1094
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">afternet I haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read the lady first</font>

1095
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,689
draft so I care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in here but um</font>

1096
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,369
on you you mentioned you've been

1097
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,960
mentioning sort of outside for sweets

1098
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:39,670
ciphers whatever but I mean the relevant

1099
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,900
question I think inside of dtls is

1100
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's what separates you require</font>

1101
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,680
details I 30 p um so where did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1102
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,899
already have some requirements i assume

1103
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,098
we simply import those yeah good

1104
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:52,089
question i was assuming you're just

1105
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:54,730
gonna do um yeah but<font color="#CCCCCC"> book picked up</font>

1106
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:57,069
typical ecdsa<font color="#E5E5E5"> best practices for this</font>

1107
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,530
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists today and bike yeah i think</font>

1108
00:40:57,069 --> 00:41:01,630
that's appropriate 86 and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

1109
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,390
think proper for secrecy with ecdsa and

1110
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,829
p250 sexist is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> jas GCM is this</font>

1111
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,058
appropriate Thank so as long as we're

1112
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:10,059
people cool with that I think that's the

1113
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:11,890
we should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there at the point</font>

1114
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:15,099
we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk monitor Cargill s13</font>

1115
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:17,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ryland want to ah yes I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1116
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:19,660
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that uh I mean</font>

1117
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:21,849
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a decision we can make like in</font>

1118
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:27,848
March but i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes you probably know</font>

1119
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:29,470
but like um but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay um alright</font>

1120
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:31,359
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean so as you're envisioning that</font>

1121
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,618
in addition to the crypto stuff we've

1122
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">been discussing things like the consent</font>

1123
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:36,569
stuff will be in the same document or

1124
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:38,980
the be a separate document<font color="#CCCCCC"> was so um</font>

1125
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:41,440
we're gonna be end up pointing to a lot

1126
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,809
of music documents right now that are

1127
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,950
talking about how i<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent a and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those are</font>

1128
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:46,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">in tonight there's nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1129
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:49,899
talking anywhere about consent and so

1130
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,329
yes i'll type of consent hum again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

1131
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,940
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some of the trickle things in</font>

1132
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:56,589
with info methods and i really started

1133
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,329
to feel terribly nauseous when they

1134
00:41:56,589 --> 00:41:59,859
looked at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> samina i think we are</font>

1135
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna have to take a hard look at the</font>

1136
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:03,880
stuff that's in flight I music right now

1137
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:05,799
for ice with<font color="#E5E5E5"> SVP okay and I think that</font>

1138
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,240
the question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> does consent belong in</font>

1139
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:09,460
that stuff right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's a new</font>

1140
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,229
ice music guy says TP document like

1141
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:13,210
right now that Christie R so he's doing

1142
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:17,200
and like you know it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> either be</font>

1143
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:18,849
there or it could be here so we have 20

1144
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,740
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two percent and then</font>

1145
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:23,740
I we will take taking the

1146
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:26,410
so yeah man I just this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ben campbell</font>

1147
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:28,029
one charter comment and we may find this

1148
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,490
is a mistake and charters can be changed

1149
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:33,190
right now the Charter says any standards

1150
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:39,669
work will be outsourced to whatever

1151
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:41,260
group would normally handle it right so

1152
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,540
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean probably it belongs in that</font>

1153
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:46,960
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> music is DPI's document to specify</font>

1154
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:49,240
how consent would look in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that does</font>

1155
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,470
introduce like some heart palpitations

1156
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,629
you read that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take a look at the</font>

1157
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:59,080
state of that work yep thank you Oh

1158
00:42:52,630 --> 00:43:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Milan ok I'm going to talk about the</font>

1159
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,860
opportunistic srtp draft on behalf of

1160
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,869
Bernard Andy Laura and Thomas next slide

1161
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:09,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh just just a note about the motivation</font>

1162
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:12,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this sum which has been talked about</font>

1163
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,840
one thing is documenting existing

1164
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,560
practice what used to be known as<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

1165
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:21,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">effort srtp another is though the the</font>

1166
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:23,500
needs of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SIP forum</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their sip connect</font>

1167
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,170
sip trunking recommendation currently is

1168
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,330
all clear text and we desperately would

1169
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,280
like to introduce srtp encryption and

1170
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:32,230
the only way to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to do it</font>

1171
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,520
opportunistically and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1172
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,350
third reason is that you know now that

1173
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,440
we have as a community embrace<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

1174
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:40,630
srtp post-snowden it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's a</font>

1175
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,230
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to define how to do it</font>

1176
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:47,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">for srtp to get media confidentiality as</font>

1177
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:49,510
often as we possibly can so but just

1178
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:52,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold on that side everyone say so this</font>

1179
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:56,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just reiterating the definition in</font>

1180
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:59,800
RFC 7435 and our charter does reference

1181
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:01,330
RFC 7345 by name so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1182
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:06,310
definition of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what opportunistic</font>

1183
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:07,960
security is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you okay so the</font>

1184
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,119
approach has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a we've talked about</font>

1185
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">this already here basically it's</font>

1186
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:16,450
offering<font color="#CCCCCC"> AVP but upgrading essentially</font>

1187
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:20,050
you know doing doing secure if you

1188
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:24,220
possibly can and and never failing if

1189
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:27,700
you can't that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic approach and</font>

1190
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:29,950
it's it's not specific to any to any

1191
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:32,770
keying method and the draft right now

1192
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:34,569
talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS stp</font>

1193
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:38,350
security descriptions or<font color="#CCCCCC"> esta</font>

1194
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:39,550
as its informally called and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zed RTP now</font>

1195
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:41,529
the current version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft is</font>

1196
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:43,630
informational so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just says here are</font>

1197
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:45,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know here they are and it gives some</font>

1198
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:48,460
examples if we're changing it to

1199
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:52,390
proposed then you know we can do things

1200
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:54,700
a little differently one possible thing

1201
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,470
is to actually just just not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

1202
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,520
about keying approaches in this draft

1203
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:03,060
just just be just be silent about them

1204
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,550
and that way people that want to use

1205
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:08,170
whatever keying method they want can can

1206
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:11,740
say that there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are compliant</font>

1207
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:13,420
with this Oh srtp spec John Peterson

1208
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,560
alternatively you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could have exactly out</font>

1209
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">there today I just not have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> northern</font>

1210
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,770
state Vincent right there are no

1211
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">nordeste that's why was left right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

1212
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,890
so I mean it you know if there's no

1213
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,720
normative statement that says this is

1214
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,310
how you do estás I think at least some

1215
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,899
of the heartburn<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I understand exist</font>

1216
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,980
somewhere in the universe about this all

1217
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,020
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> well this is how the draft has</font>

1218
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,000
always been since 00 totally gone and

1219
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:34,030
again it comes down to you is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1220
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,410
moving this to PS and they or that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1221
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,760
seems to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> likely direction for this</font>

1222
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:38,620
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1223
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,080
do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's useful information</font>

1224
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,100
here's how you do this right address but

1225
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,690
to have that not be normative behavior

1226
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,089
might be the best waited so you're

1227
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:47,950
arguing for you you just keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the way</font>

1228
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,300
it is yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> finally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it is and</font>

1229
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,259
fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine how you'd write it</font>

1230
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,910
perfectly well with what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1231
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">proposing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on having to my eye could see</font>

1232
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:56,589
either these guys working<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah i</font>

1233
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean i would prefer to keep them in</font>

1234
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:00,220
because i hate drafts where you know

1235
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:03,700
it's all you know there's no examples

1236
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:06,279
and and the like so i would prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1237
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,779
keep them in the other point is about

1238
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,850
their relaxing the authentication

1239
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,770
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tried to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that point</font>

1240
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,900
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS and failed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think due to</font>

1241
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:16,660
terminology i'll try another example

1242
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:20,080
you're doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dtls srtp handshake and</font>

1243
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,490
you fail to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fingerprint or for the</font>

1244
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,980
fingerprint all you've got is an md5

1245
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,390
hash to compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with now in a</font>

1246
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,190
comprehensive security mode you would

1247
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:30,370
fail the dtls and you would fail the

1248
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:32,260
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in opportunistic that's</font>

1249
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,700
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication you might let</font>

1250
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:38,230
that pass because hey it's better than

1251
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:40,240
clear text so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to argue i</font>

1252
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,070
don't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be arguing but I'm put the</font>

1253
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,229
example in d5 was a fantastic example

1254
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,310
the UM not get a fingerprint I don't the

1255
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,330
wait i thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that getting the</font>

1256
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,690
fingerprint was how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need for us to</font>

1257
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:49,549
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS</font>

1258
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:51,500
ons I think that that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part airline</font>

1259
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:54,520
wouldn't work also confused or wrong

1260
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:59,119
fingerprint he doesn't match I see

1261
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:00,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">um-hmm III wanna um I don't argue but I</font>

1262
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,630
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a pin in it cuz I think that</font>

1263
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,400
I'm wondering if that's actually if

1264
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:06,589
that's active if that's a done thing for

1265
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world then feeling what sort of</font>

1266
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:10,220
basic attacks you to fail<font color="#E5E5E5"> beef i think i</font>

1267
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,328
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right but i worry that i think</font>

1268
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,709
the long finger print it's like well

1269
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,700
something is basically busted on your in

1270
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and maybe you should go fix it rather</font>

1271
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,790
than try to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find sure yeah well</font>

1272
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:20,270
anyway these are the sort of

1273
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:21,859
authentication issues with opportunistic

1274
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,900
security that it that it opens up that

1275
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:26,540
are closed in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know total</font>

1276
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,490
confidentiality mode ya oughta come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

1277
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:31,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it is necessary because of the</font>

1278
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:35,720
user experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you call somebody who</font>

1279
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:38,240
doesn't support any srtp method and you

1280
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,279
simply cut get hang up you don't know

1281
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,339
what's wrong and we get the code so

1282
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,319
right and in this mode you can signal to

1283
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:47,960
the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connection but</font>

1284
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not secure so the comment was about</font>

1285
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,280
the difference between I cannot do

1286
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,020
high-level security versus I have

1287
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,849
detected an attacker and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1288
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,759
head anywhere the user it looks like I

1289
00:47:55,849 --> 00:48:00,859
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get connected and doesn't don't</font>

1290
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,910
get any securing why what happened and I

1291
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:06,770
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make of call setup I</font>

1292
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:08,089
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is fantastic</font>

1293
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:09,890
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a playwright</font>

1294
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:12,230
is the only way to deploy security in

1295
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,790
the current environment um<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess on</font>

1296
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:15,440
the philosophical question i think we

1297
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be asking ourselves in that mud</font>

1298
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,910
huts on this is um as I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of neutral</font>

1299
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,980
is that there's there's like things

1300
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:23,690
which like there's like the guy didn't

1301
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,520
didn't support what I wanted to do and

1302
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:27,079
so that's fantastic i fell about to

1303
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,819
clear text and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's like i do</font>

1304
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:30,890
the 0 to P handshake and it feels right

1305
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:32,839
and and it's like that guy's kind of

1306
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,859
busted and maybe like I should just felt

1307
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,779
a call and so I try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out like</font>

1308
00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:38,000
how we draw the line it big enough

1309
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,440
environment of people who clean the

1310
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,150
support the thing that you wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1311
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">support but they actually feel too but</font>

1312
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,849
it's worth trying to be compensate for

1313
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,319
this guy's or if it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic is</font>

1314
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:46,700
people were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't and and</font>

1315
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:48,170
then if you cling to it doesn't work

1316
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,720
they like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> screws yes I'm just like I'm</font>

1317
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:52,130
a fighter so I love you get thoughts on

1318
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,649
that yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you kind of don't want</font>

1319
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:56,839
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like covering up for bugs and poor</font>

1320
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:58,190
implementations and the like but you

1321
00:48:56,839 --> 00:48:59,359
know things where there's like a middle

1322
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:01,519
box in the way that's breaking

1323
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,259
authentication you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too</font>

1324
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,919
was to cause you to fall back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> plain</font>

1325
00:49:03,259 --> 00:49:08,749
text<font color="#E5E5E5"> janta</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> linux so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i think that</font>

1326
00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:11,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly the CRT PKS and</font>

1327
00:49:08,749 --> 00:49:13,249
ZEB<font color="#E5E5E5"> handshake fails I mean the guy</font>

1328
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,839
thinks you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> z RTP if he's do if</font>

1329
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:18,499
this year there was zero DB handshake so

1330
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:21,078
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play back his audio as g.711</font>

1331
00:49:18,499 --> 00:49:22,669
is probably not a good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess you</font>

1332
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:24,679
could send a reinvite without the CRT p

1333
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:26,808
in hopes that maybe got a middle box of

1334
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:28,669
trying to transcode his<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it says in</font>

1335
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:30,439
the opportunistic mode if your user

1336
00:49:28,669 --> 00:49:32,929
interface does something different when

1337
00:49:30,439 --> 00:49:34,549
you have say you know secure sip and

1338
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:36,289
secure media you know if it displays a

1339
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:37,699
pal<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I understand you don't do</font>

1340
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:39,859
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had not understand the Graduate</font>

1341
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:42,349
succeed so you you you you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I have</font>

1342
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:45,319
never get expectation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my question is</font>

1343
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:46,339
like if you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1344
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">other guy is trying to do a security</font>

1345
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:52,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">baptism and his and something has gone</font>

1346
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:54,408
wrong well more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the SAS doesn't you</font>

1347
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:56,899
go through this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zen RTP completes</font>

1348
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:59,419
you compare the SAS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and they're no</font>

1349
00:49:56,899 --> 00:50:02,839
good yeah or like you know UV sends you

1350
00:49:59,419 --> 00:50:05,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">an SD sends you a CRT be here yeah</font>

1351
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:07,669
exactly yeah yeah so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess the Crimea</font>

1352
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:09,380
is you could say you maybe shouldn't in

1353
00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:11,299
that case you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know do a reinvite you</font>

1354
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:13,099
know with no Krypto at all but that's

1355
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:14,538
kind of uh well that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a kid</font>

1356
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:16,819
know that that'd be a case for failing

1357
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:18,259
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zedar TP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and doing going plain</font>

1358
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:19,369
text yeah but going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play sex means</font>

1359
00:50:18,259 --> 00:50:21,619
you have to be invited because you can't

1360
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:23,809
no no that's all pointed no<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he</font>

1361
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:26,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">if he thinks he's sending crypto you</font>

1362
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:27,199
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just play back his s RTP packets</font>

1363
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:37,130
as though they didn't they weren't

1364
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:41,479
encrypted so Eric you saying you want to

1365
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:43,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">repeat that only my core because I'm</font>

1366
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:44,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking that you have consistency at</font>

1367
00:50:43,429 --> 00:50:46,099
both ends but<font color="#E5E5E5"> John than John makes a</font>

1368
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:47,989
good point which other cases where for

1369
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:50,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">any of these cryptic handshake protocols</font>

1370
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:52,759
work where the last guy to speak fix it

1371
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:54,769
worked and he screws up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thinks it</font>

1372
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:56,359
didn't work and so I wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> like and so</font>

1373
00:50:54,769 --> 00:50:58,098
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point you basically have two</font>

1374
00:50:56,359 --> 00:51:00,529
choices which is to try to recover what

1375
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:02,329
I felt a call right yeah so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail</font>

1376
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:03,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the absolute last step where you end</font>

1377
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:05,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">up in a state where one side thinks it's</font>

1378
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,308
good the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side thinks it's bad then</font>

1379
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:09,019
they're gonna be like hello yeah yeah

1380
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:11,640
the humans will sort out the little bit

1381
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:13,720
like screwed up call they'll hang out

1382
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:17,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might notice that really fast right</font>

1383
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:19,689
haha authentication would fail so yeah

1384
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:21,549
any solution needs to open another

1385
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:23,890
requirement which is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> set-up time</font>

1386
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:26,288
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something i don't think an</font>

1387
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:28,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">sterk and do but i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is a</font>

1388
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:30,460
better way to do it so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1389
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:32,319
much time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get kind of</font>

1390
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreement on the overall approach and</font>

1391
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,700
the details we can discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> in later</font>

1392
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:38,140
right no I mercenary realized about the

1393
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,368
overall pressure in the details so one

1394
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,980
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen systems do</font>

1395
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:43,539
differently than this is that precisely

1396
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,759
about Jonathan's point about mismatch

1397
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:47,619
between expectation of security you

1398
00:51:45,759 --> 00:51:50,019
offer a<font color="#E5E5E5"> VP along with some keys but then</font>

1399
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:51,759
you answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> svb if you're expecting to do</font>

1400
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:53,140
security because you think is the answer

1401
00:51:51,759 --> 00:51:54,880
should have a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both sides</font>

1402
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to be ready to do security</font>

1403
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,730
whereas in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> case your answer with a</font>

1404
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">vp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> regardless of whether you're going to</font>

1405
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:01,509
try it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not it seems a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

1406
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:02,769
ambiguous yeah I've seen that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

1407
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:04,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend it that has it that has</font>

1408
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:09,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">interop issues but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it buys</font>

1409
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:11,470
you very much you stay you stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vp the</font>

1410
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,839
whole time offer a<font color="#E5E5E5"> VP answer AVP so</font>

1411
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:15,368
that's what works rival boxes so it's

1412
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,440
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's that's</font>

1413
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:19,180
unfortunate because on motor seized

1414
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,920
currently requiring exactly the opposite

1415
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach so maybe maybe you could sense</font>

1416
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,549
a male look that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ark you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have less</font>

1417
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,200
saying that were idiots um because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1418
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:28,239
actually require you to send the right

1419
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:31,029
thing the denominator aight thing so if

1420
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:33,099
you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> re rt-pa vpf when we require to</font>

1421
00:52:31,029 --> 00:52:35,019
send you to eat blah blah blah UDP TLS

1422
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:37,029
blah blah so so so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could sense</font>

1423
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:39,519
another list telling us<font color="#CCCCCC"> for morals yeah</font>

1424
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:40,569
ok let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me other slice you'll get</font>

1425
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:44,019
anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's just an example</font>

1426
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:49,569
let's get that another example changes

1427
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:51,249
um yeah go go back to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so it has</font>

1428
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:53,440
an applica bility statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we can</font>

1429
00:52:51,249 --> 00:52:55,569
we can wordsmith it basically it says do

1430
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,239
comprehensive unless you know you're

1431
00:52:55,569 --> 00:52:59,950
trying to transition existing stuff and

1432
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,720
it has a mission of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cap neg now but it</font>

1433
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:04,808
says doesn't doesn't help because we

1434
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:11,709
don't do it anyway so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1435
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:13,900
storrington<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok yeah so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm because there</font>

1436
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:17,349
Mikey modes that it won't work that's

1437
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:18,940
that's what your time I don't know

1438
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:22,059
enough about my key<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1439
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:23,800
probably is good there are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many to</font>

1440
00:53:22,059 --> 00:53:25,660
choose from yes

1441
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,070
okay so yeah so the only question is you

1442
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,830
know right now the draft is written as

1443
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:31,570
if it's informational right but I think

1444
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:33,520
it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could just change it to PS</font>

1445
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:36,880
and I don't think we have to change

1446
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything yeah in what's there so so</font>

1447
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,810
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I reminded the</font>

1448
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:43,570
third<font color="#E5E5E5"> option would be to take any</font>

1449
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:46,180
normative text out in a in a small PS

1450
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:48,850
and undo informational if that's you

1451
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:51,910
know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest I I personally think</font>

1452
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:53,830
that would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear solution and you</font>

1453
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:56,830
know but uh but I would be I mean happy

1454
00:53:53,830 --> 00:54:01,630
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now keep it all in one draft it's</font>

1455
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:03,100
it's a no srtp draft you're saying you

1456
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:05,290
would think that would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleanest</font>

1457
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:07,900
solution tell me which that it was cuz i

1458
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:10,240
got so that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be number three when i</font>

1459
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:12,640
when i presented before I mean taking

1460
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,410
this mole right exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the small</font>

1461
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,810
standards track takes that we have

1462
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:18,490
moving it to a small draft and keeping

1463
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">this as information so that's what I</font>

1464
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:22,060
personally felt it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cleanest way</font>

1465
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,950
but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go with whatever</font>

1466
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,630
they're working group besides so I don't

1467
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:28,000
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have any need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so oh</font>

1468
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:29,560
that is there was a problem just re-read

1469
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Allen's draft while we were sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1470
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:35,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the split the</font>

1471
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:37,390
split you describe where you just take

1472
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,100
any normative text out is not this flip

1473
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:40,990
it was proposed to being in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front</font>

1474
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,270
either and I also don't think it'll work

1475
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:44,879
with the document so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you skim it real</font>

1476
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:48,930
fast you'll see how that breaks I

1477
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:52,180
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard some consensus building</font>

1478
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:54,339
towards just leaving the text in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1479
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:57,009
document as is it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> things work</font>

1480
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,900
with it we can reference it make it PS

1481
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,490
if we're only making it PS so that we

1482
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,680
have a normative reference to it without

1483
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:04,779
doing some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dance in the IETF I</font>

1484
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,790
don't care I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just assume leave it</font>

1485
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:09,640
informational and just call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1486
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:11,380
down Raph when we send it up I don't

1487
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an opinion on that soon right I'm</font>

1488
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:18,910
been the big gamble again reminding that

1489
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:22,930
the Charter has comments to say about

1490
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:24,520
doing standards work here again<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

1491
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:28,569
fix that but we need to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

1492
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:31,240
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do that Roberts solution is</font>

1493
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:32,710
well it's kind of a workaround to the

1494
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:36,919
Charter but it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work around it</font>

1495
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:40,560
Oh a wet solution to do it PS

1496
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,000
do it yet informational yeah yeah the

1497
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,650
damn<font color="#CCCCCC"> right yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we talked about</font>

1498
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before actually week we can I I</font>

1499
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:48,390
believe the reason people were talking

1500
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:53,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BS is because it relaxes</font>

1501
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:53,000
normative guidance and other PS exactly

1502
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:57,359
yeah jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> edition never going to do that</font>

1503
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,980
let's do that in a PS document let's not

1504
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,180
do that in that down Raph we want we

1505
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,099
want things to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to reference that</font>

1506
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,930
general life we're doing that so so so

1507
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:07,890
Ben do you think would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a problem to</font>

1508
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:09,990
to reach out to the group well the

1509
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:12,450
Charter I guess is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the battle plan</font>

1510
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:14,879
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first first casualty of</font>

1511
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,230
the discussion right obviously we

1512
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,490
screwed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Charter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in some places it</font>

1513
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:22,920
looks like so we can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1514
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:24,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay yeah Colleen um given that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

1515
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,000
that the part of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're talking</font>

1516
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:28,710
about is is a change to the stp spec

1517
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,930
maybe there should just be a little

1518
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:32,970
draft over<font color="#E5E5E5"> em music that does the part</font>

1519
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:34,710
we need that so so to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear aim</font>

1520
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:38,060
people to be clear that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I was</font>

1521
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:40,890
proposing um I heard some pushback um

1522
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:44,700
you know so probably we don't have like

1523
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:46,170
unanimity here uh yeah it's uh I'm

1524
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:48,930
perfectly comfortable with this being PS

1525
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,980
and having and just fixing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter</font>

1526
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,328
thing that says we can't update our

1527
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,980
music if for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reason that's like</font>

1528
00:56:51,329 --> 00:56:54,540
impossible then I guess we can like take

1529
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the two lines and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put it where else but</font>

1530
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,690
like that just seems kind of silly

1531
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,848
frankly so right i proceeded to make

1532
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:01,910
this PS and let the<font color="#E5E5E5"> area directors</font>

1533
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:04,440
direct as they were supposed yeah

1534
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:07,649
Jonathan Jonathan I some two things

1535
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,060
first I don't exactly know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where this</font>

1536
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:11,849
would fit in but I said I would rely for

1537
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:13,560
Joe Joe Hall who had to leave early said

1538
00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:16,260
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave early i'd like to</font>

1539
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:18,630
preemptively hum no to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Estes sorry the</font>

1540
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,920
goal here is to avoid PMI feel estes

1541
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,180
contrary to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know exactly</font>

1542
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">how that fits it was a good discussion</font>

1543
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:26,160
but I said I'd relay it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay mom the the</font>

1544
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,630
other point I'd make is I think what

1545
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is actually updating it's not a</font>

1546
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:32,880
music documents but the various srtp and

1547
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">DTLS answer to be documents which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1548
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,920
believe our apt<font color="#CCCCCC"> core</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so last</font>

1549
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:41,310
two comments if<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's let's comment</font>

1550
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,660
okay yeah I mean to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> M</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> music thing I</font>

1551
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,950
mean the problem is I suspect there are

1552
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,990
going to be a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we're gonna</font>

1553
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:47,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to go to em music for right and so</font>

1554
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:48,990
if we're going to do can send and that

1555
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,430
like needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to music and it could</font>

1556
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:53,098
turn out that what they're actually

1557
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:55,558
like a shadow overall i'm using this one

1558
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:57,869
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hadn't considered before but the</font>

1559
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,880
thinking about doing consent we could

1560
00:57:57,869 --> 00:58:01,470
have like just a shadow draft and music

1561
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,700
that does all the standards work and

1562
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:04,319
maybe maybe this is close to what we're

1563
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:10,710
envisioning the time we chartered right

1564
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:15,119
bro you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in music okay</font>

1565
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:18,420
well but no it's like the baby so so it

1566
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:20,940
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> M music ice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sdp draft I think</font>

1567
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:22,290
though that is where this stuff needs to

1568
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,369
at least that's the traffic only<font color="#E5E5E5"> craft I</font>

1569
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,990
know of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1570
00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:27,180
today so I mean it's like if that

1571
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:29,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">belongs there then the consent stuff</font>

1572
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,480
belongs for that belongs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you</font>

1573
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,010
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> make an argument that what we need</font>

1574
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,839
is some<font color="#CCCCCC"> have musics back that shadows</font>

1575
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:37,260
any standards track changes that we're

1576
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:38,759
making testp here right so so as I said

1577
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:41,369
that that was what I originally thought

1578
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,780
it was cleanest I hear that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1579
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:45,240
best way is basically to continue

1580
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:47,160
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this as a full draft thinking</font>

1581
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:49,229
that it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be PS i will be talking to</font>

1582
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:53,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">ben if that's possible we'll do that if</font>

1583
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:58,410
not we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> explore other options great</font>

1584
00:58:53,490 --> 00:59:00,058
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds good perfect um so now I</font>

1585
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,618
mean we are finishing the session it

1586
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:03,329
seems that we have kind of a clear way

1587
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:06,990
forward so the only thing we have to do

1588
00:59:03,329 --> 00:59:08,549
now um is to decide to take these two

1589
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,740
drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> as working group items so I'm</font>
