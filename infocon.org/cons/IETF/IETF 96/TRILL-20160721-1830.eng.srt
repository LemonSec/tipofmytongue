them is the our bridge channel draft

144
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,400
draft IETF to elaborate channel 10 and

145
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,920
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them is the trill over IP draft</font>

146
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,170
which is it draft IETF trail over IP 6

147
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay both of these drafts have the seam</font>

148
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:30,750
need um which is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need a way to</font>

149
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,490
do a multi-party keying right right now

150
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,040
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do point to point but they</font>

151
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,100
can't do point to multipoint securely

152
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,219
and so a<font color="#CCCCCC"> donalds come up with a way to</font>

153
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,440
do that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is defined in this third</font>

154
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,900
draft which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I go okay they both</font>

155
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,690
need group<font color="#E5E5E5"> key and he's come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a</font>

156
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,000
way to do this that would work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for both</font>

157
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> documents and we've already</font>

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,780
agreed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group to advance</font>

159
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,569
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Channel Tunnel document uh with a</font>

160
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:04,319
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point-to-point King defined and</font>

161
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,940
say that mom group<font color="#CCCCCC"> King is kind of left</font>

162
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,430
to future work and then publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

163
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,430
group keen document and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then publish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

164
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,469
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used by the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> channel</font>

165
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">tunnel and what we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do basically</font>

166
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,860
is put trill over IP in that same bucket

167
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,920
to advance it with the point-to-point

168
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,360
define work on the group keying which

169
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,360
may take<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a little while to get right</font>

170
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,970
and then document how both<font color="#E5E5E5"> trill over IP</font>

171
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,090
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Channel Tunnel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft would use</font>

172
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:33,530
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> king to allow point-to-point</font>

173
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,530
point-to-multipoint to be done securely

174
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,920
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently if we did want to do</font>

175
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:43,110
a multicast um messaging and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font>

176
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,689
to do it securely we'd have to serialize

177
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,850
and turn a point-to-multipoint message

178
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,400
into a number of point-to-point messages

179
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,500
and and the trill over IP draft already

180
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,449
explains on how to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

181
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,400
inefficient so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that things</font>

182
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,440
wouldn't work but we'd be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define</font>

183
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,430
another draft on how to do it more

184
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,100
efficiently there's a group<font color="#CCCCCC"> king</font>

185
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,020
solution document that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been designed</font>

186
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,810
and is currently in draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> eastlake trill</font>

187
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,449
group keying um it's just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out</font>

188
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,510
as an individual draft

189
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:17,270
between the last two IITs it securely

190
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,280
distributed shared keys to the group

191
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,079
members so in the case of multicast

192
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,810
traffic the members in that multicast

193
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:28,970
group arm it provides King from

194
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:31,040
multicast and broadcast arm but which

195
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,780
group member originated the packet is

196
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,750
not known<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there would be a group key</font>

197
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,760
and you could know securely that the

198
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,340
packet was originated by some money in

199
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that group but you would not know who in</font>

200
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,430
that group originated the packet at

201
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,880
least you wouldn't know that securely

202
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,319
that could be spoofed so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how how</font>

203
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,590
we're trying to solve that particular

204
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,660
problem um if authentication of a

205
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,460
particular group member is needed then

206
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,800
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use unicast package you need</font>

207
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,870
to use point to point i'm so that you're

208
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,209
actually authenticating who sent it and

209
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,710
as we said that's less efficient but

210
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's already supported by the current</font>

211
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,440
trill over IP draft and also by the

212
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,780
current channel telegram so we have an

213
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,960
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move forward here and it's a</font>

214
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">three-step process the first step would</font>

215
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,830
be that we put both the<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel tunnel</font>

216
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:24,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the trill over IP draft</font>

217
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:26,780
through with the point-to-point key and

218
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,930
the way to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it securely is to</font>

219
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:32,689
serialize your multicast send it to each

220
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:36,709
point directly in a point-to-point

221
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:40,430
manner then we write a key a group key

222
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution mechanism which we're going</font>

223
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,579
to probably need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of help from</font>

224
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,130
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ron we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been getting help</font>

225
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,630
from the security area all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the log on</font>

226
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,450
these drafts so I assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be able</font>

227
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get it when we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got that done we</font>

228
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:56,480
write a draft covering how to use that

229
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:00,410
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> king mechanism in both trill over</font>

230
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,810
IP and uh the Channel Tunnel draft so

231
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,030
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our proposed way forward which</font>

232
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,199
will get us unstuck on both the channel

233
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,910
tunnel which I think we've already

234
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,090
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward this way right</font>

235
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">Donald and drill over IP which we're</font>

236
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,710
asking the working group to also agree

237
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,630
to move forward this way so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our</font>

238
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:21,020
proposal right now that we're asking the

239
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:23,540
working group to agree to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the plane</font>

240
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,010
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward shows all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

241
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,290
existing drafts and what new

242
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,730
drafts we would be planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write so</font>

243
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:33,230
there's trill over IP and there's a

244
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:37,250
trill<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel tunnel and those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are our</font>

245
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:42,050
two deliverables right and right now

246
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:44,630
we've got trill over IP 06 and I think

247
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,609
we've got trill over<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tunnel it's</font>

248
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,340
can as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car 10 is the current version</font>

249
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great and that's already passed</font>

250
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF last call with only the</font>

251
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,030
point-to-point keying<font color="#E5E5E5"> and transmission</font>

252
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:59,570
in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what we're proposing is</font>

253
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:01,459
that we send trill over IP version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

254
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,730
last call with only the point-to-point

255
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">king and transmission in it and that we</font>

256
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,600
then write this group keen document

257
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,520
which order or we adopt this group

258
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">keying document that Donald has already</font>

259
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:19,400
written I'm assuming we we like the

260
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:22,689
contents of it and then um we end up

261
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:26,030
writing we end up publishing it as a

262
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:28,580
group document eventually and then we

263
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:32,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">also write a document that explains how</font>

264
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:35,000
to do trill over IP and channel tunnel

265
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,380
using group teen document and I think

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,630
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is drawn that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be one</font>

267
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,689
other document that explains how to use

268
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,780
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those those capabilities</font>

269
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,520
so does everybody understand what it is

270
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,800
that we're proposing we do this is

271
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,540
mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what is in each document</font>

272
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,490
more than it's about a particular

273
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,199
technical solution but is everybody so

274
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,900
anybody who feels that they don't

275
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:02,690
understand has any questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

276
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:06,620
we're proposing here so our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps</font>

277
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,840
are that we hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people agree</font>

278
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,100
draft IETF trill<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel tunnel will</font>

279
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,430
proceed normally it's already been

280
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,140
through IETF last call will revise and

281
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,790
create new drafts is on the previous

282
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,340
page which means we'll make a neutral

283
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,740
over IP document that says that you know

284
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,750
you serialize now and that point to

285
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,030
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to multipoint will be</font>

286
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,170
defined later very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what it</font>

287
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,560
already says in the Channel Tunnel

288
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,150
document that we then working group last

289
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,770
call the trill over IP draft because

290
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,840
this is as far as we know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

291
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,490
remaining issue in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that draft and we</font>

292
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,840
move it forward like we have channel

293
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,840
tunnels through our

294
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:45,380
RC publication that hopefully the

295
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:51,460
working group will adopt the new fairly

296
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:53,720
generic group<font color="#CCCCCC"> King draft and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

297
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:57,470
think we're kind of leaving out here we

298
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,470
will oh and then later on<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will write</font>

299
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:02,660
the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific draft on how channel</font>

300
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">tunnel and trail over IP will use that</font>

301
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,849
generic group<font color="#CCCCCC"> King draft and we will</font>

302
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,910
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> will try to publish both of those</font>

303
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:13,909
documents so I think really what we're

304
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback from the group</font>

305
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,230
on that plan does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok any</font>

306
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerns particularly we'd like to know</font>

307
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,030
if anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> has any concerns about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I</font>

308
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,460
imagine we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to put a</font>

309
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,899
call out to the the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list to see</font>

310
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,610
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with everyone too but</font>

311
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's basically where we are at this</font>

312
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,790
point with a hope that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

313
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,429
document ready for working group last

314
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,290
call about a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this meeting</font>

315
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:40,340
yeah the only thing I would say is that

316
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:42,260
when the the plan was this group<font color="#CCCCCC"> keying</font>

317
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,030
document quarantine<font color="#CCCCCC"> dock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way also has</font>

318
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,730
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific stuff about Channel Tunnel</font>

319
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and stuff when it's separated out in the</font>

320
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,380
01 version which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just group keying</font>

321
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we do a work group adoption on that</font>

322
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,240
might also be an excellent time to ask

323
00:17:53,060 --> 00:18:00,230
for security review by somebody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

324
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,390
security area we also need um people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

325
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,940
just review that document<font color="#E5E5E5"> me this way</font>

326
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,500
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking the working group to</font>

327
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,570
adopt the group<font color="#E5E5E5"> keen document as Donald</font>

328
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,310
said it needs to update it it also just

329
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,409
needs to be reviewed by people in this

330
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,330
group as well which I I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

331
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:17,150
we've gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> really any feedback on it</font>

332
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,590
yet it also um so please review that

333
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,150
document as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as what's up here I</font>

334
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,399
guess we can make a request to say

335
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,500
please look at it in four weeks they'll

336
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,790
be like a cleaner version but it would

337
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,090
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we could get some</font>

338
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,710
feedback on that document<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometime in</font>

339
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,020
the you know next couple months so that

all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is intended to speed</font>

362
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:49,020
update on the what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on in the</font>

363
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,690
directory related drafts and also the

364
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,570
art optimization draft which was

365
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,419
returned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group so it's</font>

366
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:00,240
going over the drafts there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the ia</font>

367
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:02,700
absentee lv which is at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end the RFC</font>

368
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,020
editors cute as a data format draft so

369
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,850
we were hearing about this channel

370
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,530
tunnel draft you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

371
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">things but it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is also related to the</font>

372
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,299
directory stuff because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's used for</font>

373
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,090
the security of pull directory messages

374
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:17,370
requests and responses sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and</font>

375
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:20,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">received back from a full directory are</font>

376
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:23,219
secured using the channel tunnel draft

377
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,340
are the main directory assistance

378
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:30,299
mechanisms one provider the main all the

379
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,918
the big mechanism it supports push

380
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,260
directories and pull directories hosted

381
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,480
on our bridges where's pull directories

382
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,250
hosted on an end station and it lets

383
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,770
other our bridges extract stuff from

384
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,890
those directories and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of a diagram</font>

385
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:47,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">showing this and the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

386
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:49,440
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an extension graft which is</font>

387
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extend the access to the</font>

388
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,700
directory to end stations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

389
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain in a sec why we want to do that</font>

390
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:03,179
so there's a diagram showing what it can

391
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:05,290
do so there's a push directory client

392
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,730
over here and it can send

393
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:09,909
west's you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> either have everything</font>

394
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:12,550
pushed to it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> pantura can send requests</font>

395
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it to a full directory and ease the a</font>

396
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,540
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> R & R</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bridge could be a push</font>

397
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,430
directory or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull directory or both or</font>

398
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,790
you know whatever it wants and also

399
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:24,220
defines how to send pull requests

400
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,780
through a proxy and find what the proxy

401
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,490
does this client doesn't know that's

402
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,110
Brock see it thinks the pull directory

403
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,090
is here they can actually be on an end

404
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,889
station there's a mapping that occurs

405
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,659
here because it needs to send some more

406
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">information here's just an ordinary end</font>

407
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,050
station just to shown for new

408
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,590
particularly good<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know reason it</font>

409
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:44,230
just goes here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sarkozy in a sec if</font>

410
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:46,060
this our bridge wanted to do our pop

411
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,710
tamai zation it might base that on

412
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,470
information that it got from the

413
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:53,500
directory so what does this extension

414
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:57,640
graft do extensions draft allows an end

415
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:00,400
station to actually send polar or

416
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:04,210
requests or to get stuff push to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

417
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,880
a client proxy so the client proxy looks

418
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,550
like it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a regular bridge so if</font>

419
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,320
this end<font color="#CCCCCC"> station send the pull request</font>

420
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,870
it sees you can see this client proxy

421
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,970
here it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets forwarded to the pull</font>

422
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,370
request full directory here or possibly

423

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,650
that the correct stuff we pushed out to

428
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so why would an end station want all</font>

429
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,210
this directory stuff well okay here's a

430
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,960
page on the clients graphs essentially

431
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:45,730
there's the ARP optimization draft which

432
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,590
indeed wants directory information<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

433
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,300
local information about the

434
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,520
correspondence between IP and mac and

435
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,210
things like that in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

436
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,560
optimize respond locally to<font color="#CCCCCC"> arps or</font>

437
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,350
neighbor discovery or things like that

438
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,570
and there's two graphs about specialized

439
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,580
end stations these are special kinds of

440
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:06,250
end stations<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is the directory</font>

441
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,649
assisted in cap and this is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> N station</font>

442
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:11,440
which does the intra Lin capsulation

443
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:14,470
itself and send the encapsulated packet

444
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,920
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge our bridge and the edge are</font>

445
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,970
but at the far end the and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

446
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,409
out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that end say</font>

447
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,330
she's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> decap Slater to the edge</font>

448
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:24,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">our bridge so it doesn capsulation but</font>

449
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:27,879
it doesn't do d capsulation and there's

450
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:29,799
also a draft on smart n nodes which do

451
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,630
both encapsulation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> d capsulation can</font>

452
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,539
actually do address learning and things

453
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,820
like that at the end station so those

454
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:39,760
would be potential clients at end

455
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:42,070
stations most annotations currently

456
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,080
don't obviously know about directory

457
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,580
services they'd have to add something to

458
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,539
the end station for it to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

459
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:52,570
those services so that's Jill here's

460
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:54,700
what's kind of going on we have the data

461
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:59,260
structure is in the RFC editors q

462
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:02,200
channel tunnel is a past IETF last call

463
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:04,110
and as needs a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of minor</font>

464
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,580
changes to get through the iesg

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about that in a second</font>

467
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,678
it's been sent back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group</font>

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is has gone through a working group</font>

471
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:21,850

473
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:27,610
through the last call it needs some drum

474
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,899
review comments resolved sorry it is the

475
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,459
directory extensions this is a

476
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,679
dependency graph so like smart n nodes

477
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,510
would have to use directory extensions

478
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,820
because it wants to get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the directory</font>

479
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,390
from an end station and here's the main

480
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:44,730
directory mechanisms which use this data

481
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:44,730
format and use this security mechanism

482
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:54,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i don't know you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

483
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,530
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this okay so this is the yr bendy</font>

484
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:09,909
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent back to the working group and</font>

485
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:12,010
what we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do they left and right</font>

487
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:18,820
is a yeah that's it yes so this arbonne

488
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,900
ND optimization draft actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will</font>

489
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:27,490
receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> some deep questions um so its</font>

490
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:31,299
return to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking group and uh is</font>

491
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,830
working okay so there we receive the

492
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:36,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightest castles we sir</font>

493
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:40,779
with the listed points here the first

494
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:43,360
one is regarding their how to age out

495
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:47,409
there learned address by the edge of

496
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">bridges we didn't touch it so actually</font>

497
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:50,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are various possibilities so we</font>

498
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,809
are going to cover it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

499
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,600
revision for example the very

500
00:25:52,809 --> 00:26:00,190
traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout is going to be can</font>

501
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">be used or PA periodically um the local</font>

502
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:05,980
station can send there are plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> pings</font>

503
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:09,929
so we are going to touch this part in

504
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:14,260
the next revision and there are some

505
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:17,669
options in current revision section 3.2

506
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:19,840
they're actually there are five options

507
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:23,559
currently we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave for the</font>

508
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,019
implementers to to use any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them but</font>

509
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:29,980
the suggestion is we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> give some</font>

510
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:34,059
guidance especially actually when<font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font>

511
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:36,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the security and ease use some of the</font>

512
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,889
options might not be applicable so

513
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:44,229
that's why the guidance would be

514
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:46,600
required in the set point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

515
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:51,850
source address of the responses for the

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:53,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">ARP should be synthesized by the edge a</font>

517
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,689
preacher's this part we're going to

518
00:26:53,830 --> 00:27:00,750
touch it in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> room business as</font>

519
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:04,059
well what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here's a continued in</font>

520
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:08,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay for the for the swine I've kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

521
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:12,370
a cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the stand we</font>

522
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:16,240
should we were going to more mark we are

523
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:18,820
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clearer clearly specify what to</font>

524
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,309
do in case of the security and<font color="#CCCCCC"> D since</font>

525
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:24,610
some of their options should be ruled

526
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:27,850
out the last one is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some okay</font>

527
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:35,469
questionable keywords<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's going to</font>

528
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:39,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">be fixed so here's the plan um we have</font>

529
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:43,690
already we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have already respond one</font>

530
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:46,509
of the discuss out of three in what we

531
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:49,869

and updated draft to incorporating all

00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:05,889
comes from John Hudson but John's not

548

thank you John he always<font color="#E5E5E5"> likes animation</font>

550
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:18,599
so it have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up so in April we</font>

551
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:21,369
brought up the subject for charter worth

552
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:25,509
resolution now we're presenting draft

553
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:27,189
changes the current charter I think you

554
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:33,369
can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone through all</font>

00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:23,799
we've got pendant to drafts based on the

572
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:25,659
security analysis we just went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

573
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:29,349
all of those drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we have the</font>

574
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:31,419
dependency on the key and we move this

575
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:34,989
stuff on the interoperability to the

576
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:39,309
wiki here are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few things we think are</font>

577
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:42,519
useful for the the working group the

578
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:45,129
real thing that we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for is</font>

579
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:47,889
just as many things are moving toward st

580
00:30:45,129 --> 00:30:52,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">enter controller we'd like to make sure</font>

581
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:56,228
that trill like many of the porting

582
00:30:52,119 --> 00:31:00,070
protocols has better stn support we want

583
00:30:56,229 --> 00:31:04,149
to increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> our transparency which will</font>

584
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:07,139
reduce coupling and we want to add some

585
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:13,199
small content now one of the interesting

586
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:13,199
so you can see the proposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes here</font>

587
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:23,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna pause</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here in case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

588
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:26,379
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the Charter ok here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

589
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:29,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">chance shall I go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and let me go a</font>

590
00:31:26,379 --> 00:31:31,509
little slower rather than read words for

591
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:35,469
those of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are in the back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up in</font>

592
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:39,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">the front and ask us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions I can</font>

593
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:41,709
read them but usually I trip over a word

594
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:43,570
yeah stuff here that's crossed out is

595
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:45,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">going away and stuff that's underlined</font>

596
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,039
is new text added so like the previous

597
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:51,009
slide is all crossed out texts<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

598
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:54,729
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> we completed this is the first</font>

599
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:58,119
longer than any stuff it remains sure

600
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:59,619
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> Atlas so I so question with the is</font>

601
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:03,389
with the traffic engineering because

602
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:07,178
traffic engineering can be sizable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

603
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:09,369
the question here is who needs it what's

604
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:11,109
the drive and motivation and there's a

605
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:13,418
lot of really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool technology in trail</font>

606
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:14,350
but there's also already<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

607
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:19,780
complexity

608
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:22,389
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in understanding what</font>

609
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,549
the requirements said basic where the

610
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:28,419
operational desire to use it is what the

611
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:29,950
applicability is and I mean you produce

612
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:31,840
a lot of really good documents but it's

613
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,049
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of documents and they got to have</font>

614
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,330
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented deployment learning</font>

615
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:40,360
I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little concerned about continuing</font>

616
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:43,120
to add more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more functionality that</font>

617
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,159
can be quite large<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one of the</font>

618
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:51,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that it's a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good question</font>

619
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:53,260
and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be concerned one of the</font>

620
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the reasons</font>

621
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:00,158
that we got into a traffic engineering

622
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,770
is Bob's ecn draft and his comments on

do some more discussion on list and<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:45,010
us dig a little into that that's an

633
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting point I'll just leave that</font>

634
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:50,799
publicly where we have it perhaps you

635
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:56,250
and I and Donald can have a

636
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,250
heart-to-heart talk afterwards yeah

637
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:05,530
transparent connections Donald Ali's

638
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:10,419
looking for links to well that's

639
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:12,340
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> e if you want to provide</font>

640
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,138
aboard the carrier service which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

641
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,210
independent of the attached networks

642
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:19,270
troll as originally written was

643
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:21,369
potentially purely a customer level

644
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,109
protocol and all right at the same level

645
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:25,270
but there are deployments and

646
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:28,049
implementations that are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used in</font>

647
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:33,579
more of a service provider

648
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:35,109
mode and in fact at least one

649
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:38,919
implementation which has been which is

650
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:41,768
<font color="#CCCCCC">called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trill and uses exactly the trill</font>

651
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:43,210
data format uses a slightly different

652
00:34:41,768 --> 00:34:47,109
control for me I don't exactly always

653
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,429
been more transparent<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and so if it</font>

654
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:50,230
with the devil given here is the

655
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:52,389
currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> troll is specified very</font>

656
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,699
carefully to minimize spanning tree and

657
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,700
block bpdus<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the edge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on</font>

658
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:59,799
whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want to just let stuff</font>

659
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:03,038
flow through and have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trill be</font>

660
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:04,660
more of a provider pipe or whatever then

661
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,950
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have a mode which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is less</font>

662
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,509
coupled and I think there are

663
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,549
implementations that do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but there's</font>

664
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:12,789
no way standardized in the spec for

665
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:15,160
doing and the operator deployment in

666
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:16,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Poland and some of the other places</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

667
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,640
understanding is that they were sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

668
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,129
looking for something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

669
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,460
I Delia I can't say specifically where

670
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:26,259
the one I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is but he still is</font>

671
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,849
used in several internet exchanges for

672
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:30,910
example and that's an example of case

673
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:32,410
where depending you know you whitewater

674
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:35,049
be bored is transparent as you could

675
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:38,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn exchanges in</font>

676
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:41,980
Eastern Europe particularly in burb sure

677
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:45,098
that makes good<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm trying</font>

678
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,170
since you're asking specifics we're

679
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:48,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to give you deployment specifics</font>

680
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,160
since I<font color="#CCCCCC"> told you what the mode of</font>

681
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,750
notation was as to whether stuff was new

682
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,230
text or not I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

683
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:59,349
be be sure that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true so yeah one</font>

684
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:08,019
point here which actually should be

685
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:12,910
underlined<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sorry uh okay um and</font>

00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:16,258
again just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help our ID my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">understanding of six and the deployment</font>

688
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:21,569
characteristics is number six where you

689
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,880
reduce control plane and our debt

690
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:28,049
excellent error isolation was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>

691
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,099
with some issues as well in deployment

00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:32,440
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Allah is asking its</font>

693
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:35,019
deployment questions yeah well I'm

694
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,000
saying I guess what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm saying is you've</font>

695
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:38,740
got a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good technology but a lot</font>

696
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,480
of complicated and some point we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

697
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,020
pause and say how's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> going with the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">industry</font>

699
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,800
what are they using can we start moving

00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:47,380
to supporting operational deployment

701
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,110
concerns as a potent issues as opposed

702
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:53,890
to expect yeah that that's what this

703
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:57,400
that's why six<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on the chairs</font>

704
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:59,740
discussion have headed toward not adding

features but only adding features that

706
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:06,790
are four deployments so that's our some

707
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:09,940
of the stuff have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> given to the</font>

711
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:20,140
for number five is when you're talking

00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:21,790
about payload types are such as IP are

713

you envisioning that being like a next

714
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,710
protocol field type of thing or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

715
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:30,190
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are their existence they're just</font>

716
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:33,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">bits in the header</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay which were</font>

717
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:35,170
originally money they're they're

718
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:37,540
critical bits now and then these are

719
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,020
treated as such by existing silicon and

720
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:43,590
so you could use a field in there for

721
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:46,150
payload type and it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for</font>

722
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,400
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm not including unnecessary</font>

723
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">field like in this IP you don't need to</font>

724
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,420
mac<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses and stuff like that and it</font>

725
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:57,940
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done safely because existing</font>

726
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:00,880
version silicon will trap such packets

727
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,500
and if you are about to forward to a a

728
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,690
trill switch which doesn't support that

729
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,890
feature then you can in fact expand the

730
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:10,660
packet and make it compatible so it

731
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,210
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know that's the the</font>

732
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:16,270

yeah name change because life is been

00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:02,450
crazy with people miss consuming but

748
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:06,440
that's a middle that's a minister via

749
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:08,569
moment ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we need a</font>

750
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,470
discussion with the ad<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the one point</font>

751
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:15,650
on te I think the rest of them Donald

752
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:17,810
did we hear anything new I wish I don't

753
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:21,020
know that John's got this<font color="#E5E5E5"> job is John</font>

754
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:23,750
got feedback in there on I didn't get

755
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:26,030
Jabbar up and functioning so well he's

756
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,310
on the medicos oh he's good you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

757
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,380
speak if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you order dinner can you speak</font>

758
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:36,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">them be good if he wants but it isn't</font>

759
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:38,359
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure yeah maybe not yeah I'm not</font>

760
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:41,869
seeing it well John if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

761
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:45,650
email if we've missed anything questions

762
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:51,589
is out mainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you have anything you</font>

763
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:54,170
know from needs from deployments anyone

764
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:57,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's what we are trying to</font>

765
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:02,780
focus is what do we need for actual

766
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,760
deployments so one thing this is

767
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,000
brainstormed on the fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you could</font>

768
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">take it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for all it's worth but one thing</font>

769
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be interesting to think about</font>

770
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:17,869
is something along I guess something

771
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a deployment experience or</font>

772
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:23,510
applicability there or profile or you

773
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:25,760
have there's an awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

774
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:28,569
options and pieces and it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

775
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to have sort of a map of</font>

776
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:34,060
this is a this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of it that</font>

777
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:39,310
worked well together to solve particular

778
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:42,049
applicability um yeah they're there

779
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:45,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a spectrum of things which might</font>

780
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:47,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">be because all it will tries to be zero</font>

781
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:48,349
configuration there are things you can

782
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,200
tweak here and there and there's also

783
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:52,460
things people have encountered which

784
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,169
blindly following the letter<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the spec</font>

785
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:57,109
turns out not necessarily quite be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

786
00:40:54,170 --> 00:41:01,130
right thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular cases where</font>

787
00:40:57,109 --> 00:41:03,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have parallel links</font>

788
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:06,980
of really radically different bandwidth

789
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:08,330
you know that you really better to

790
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,610
ignore the ones that are like

791
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:12,920
insignificant because you know timing

792
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:14,900
and cetera and you either may be fairly

793
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,830
obvious but you know a thing on

794
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:21,020
implementation deployment of krill no

795
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:24,170
actually my configuration deployment

796
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:28,520
would be yes I wasn't asleep speaking

797
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:30,470
about so much the deployment as I have

798
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,950
to talk with my hands you see the broad

799
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:35,209
feature set<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right so there are many</font>

800
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:39,799
drafts or you could say you could do it

801
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:43,340
this way or<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way and it's a lot to</font>

802
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:46,870
read so I think having something that

803
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:49,580
and we want to encourage deployment and

804
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:53,180
one of the ways of doing that is to sort

805
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:56,110
of articulate sets<font color="#E5E5E5"> of functionality that</font>

806
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:59,149
are working<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve particular problems</font>

807
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:03,860
not saying it needs but just to think

808
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:06,560
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we had put it might be good to</font>

809
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:09,860
go with along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with another focus on the</font>

810
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,900
implementation reports on the wiki yes

811
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:15,800
yeah the ecn stuff is basically uh

812
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:19,160
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're tweaking some bits in</font>

813
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,680
the header essentially so I don't know

814
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,270
you know buddy it's not explicitly

815
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,850
called out as a work item certainly but

816
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:28,340
it's so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay put it in there</font>

817
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:30,589
like the transport 80 is happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

818
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">can put it in there yes we now know what</font>

819
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,600
we have we have one item to check them

820
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,920
and a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too I think all the</font>

821
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,960
areas should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be happy including the</font>

822
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:44,090
transfer<font color="#CCCCCC"> data transfer Davies must be</font>

823
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:48,830
happy Spencer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need to be happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

824
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:51,410
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at a pause waiting for Bob to</font>

825
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:54,319
come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh actually I'm listed on that</font>

826
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:56,450
presentation almost oh so I guess you

827
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,700
know we have where we have like 18

828
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,830
minutes left in this session on it it

829
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,480
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be reduced</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our request to one hour</font>

830
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:05,900
because there were so many work items

831
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,520
for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a session requests for this ITF</font>

832
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,320
meeting we were people were generally

833
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:14,870
asked to try to reduce their requests

834
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:16,370
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I could give the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ECA I'm sure I</font>

835
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,299
can't give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as well as Bob but yeah</font>

836
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:23,089
yeah you have a

837
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:26,390
for the last item I think item<font color="#CCCCCC"> 60 para</font>

838
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:34,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">charter member we just did the Charter</font>

839
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:34,509
and it worth yeah yeah the Charter so

840
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:42,200
there's some particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide or yeah</font>

841
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:45,800
actually assist with improved<font color="#E5E5E5"> error</font>

842
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:49,129
Isaac isolation I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a new</font>

843
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:53,120
document uploaded regarding to collect

844
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:56,000
the statistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> aero data at all on our</font>

845
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:58,670
null error data so probably it sir we

846
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,670
can put improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> every solution isolation</font>

847
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:05,290
and statistics collection I catch you

848
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a six that would be good</font>

849
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:15,070
most of the trill yang models um well

850
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:20,030
they have both OEM and regular

851
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:21,950
configuration but I didn't check I need

852
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:25,280
to go back after they<font color="#CCCCCC"> finish the lime</font>

853
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:31,299
stuff to even look at the OEM models for

854
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,300
error statistics because they were first

855
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:53,980
focused on something else so that's a

856
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:55,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">good comment ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I say this is the</font>

857
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:58,160
technical stuff here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really mostly</font>

858
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:03,580
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Boggs so I said have applied</font>

859
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,580
supplied that trellis part of it but

860
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:10,700
cities in here are we now have a 15

861
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,950
minutes left so what a nice en explicit

862
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,899
congestion notification nope I know how

863
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:19,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are aware of it but</font>

864
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:21,200
basically the provides we're sort of

865
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:23,359
indication going down the stack this is

866
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:28,089
higher level applications and there for

867
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:30,740
over 33 place the IP layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 down here</font>

868
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:35,750
indication that it's

869
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:38,270
ecn compatible parents work<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah capable</font>

870
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:41,420
ecn capable transport is indicated on

871
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:44,060
the way down and congestion experienced

872
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:46,369
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way up so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that the</font>

873
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:49,430
far end knows whether some data received

874
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:51,140
ran into a congested packet thing along

875
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way course the condition was severe</font>

876
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:56,779
enough the data won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever get through</font>

877
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:59,210
at all but usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have you</font>

878
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,320
know a sudden blockage if nothing is

879
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,540
getting through then you no longer have

880
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,580
adjacency and other mechanisms will work

881
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,050
so it just congested it prudently just

882
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:13,369
some of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get through in that can</font>

883
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:17,000
all be mark yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the idea is that</font>

884
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:20,710
you can mark in IP these days whether

885
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,420
it's easy incompatible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can mark</font>

886
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:25,130
whether it's experient condition so<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0</font>

887
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,170
there's some bits which when there's

888
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:34,390
zero just sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this default means</font>

889
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:38,150
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not ecn compatible and if there's</font>

890
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:39,618
100<font color="#CCCCCC"> one means it is ecn capable and 411</font>

891
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:43,790
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experience congestion so</font>

892
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">normally IP does flow control based on</font>

893
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:48,650
the loss of packets but if you've lost

894
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the packet then the day didn't get</font>

895
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:51,770
through and you've kind of not in as

896
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:53,810
good a shape you usually prefer for data

897
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,580
to get through but to still learn that

898
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:58,420
there was congestion so you can perhaps

899
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:01,670
throttle<font color="#CCCCCC"> back the rate you're sending so</font>

900
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:04,090
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do this intro using the</font>

901
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:08,630
extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> flags word yep in the header</font>

902
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:10,460
sorry Elias no<font color="#E5E5E5"> hat no hats this time but</font>

903
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:13,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">for just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little confused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could you go</font>

904
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:18,590
back thank you so the whole point of

905
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:21,529
having ecn is to be a message to the

906
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:26,300
host that congestion was experienced and

907
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:30,080
if you get the signal you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want I mean I</font>

908
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:32,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess what I'm poking at it why what is</font>

909
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,920
the reasoning and I realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

910
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:37,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bob's you may not have the full answer</font>

911
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:40,100
for not propagating upward to the IP

912
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:43,850
header because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I the IP inner</font>

913
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,660
header is what's going to be received by

914
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:47,348
the host

915
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:50,629
to get the congestion signal to back off

916
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:53,809
well it does get propagated to the IP

917
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:55,460
header if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's IP traffic there's a</font>

918
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:58,250
later slide which shows the tunnel

919
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:01,250
structure awesome only like one

920
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:03,020
or two slides later so sorry I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

921
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:05,030
party not doing a very good job I didn't

922
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect to present this I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't anyway</font>

923
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:10,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so yeah so there's this optional</font>

924
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,288
<font color="#CCCCCC">flags word which has a few bits defining</font>

925
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:16,058
it currently like if you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger</font>

926
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:18,740
hop count you can put it there or

927
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:21,619
similar bits so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put this</font>

928
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:23,660
the current sort of ecn field like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

929
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:26,930
have an IP fits in a couple bits over

930
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,960
here and including a value<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is the</font>

931
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:31,970
non-critical congestion experience which

932
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,799
is slightly renamed for our fill

933
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:35,390
application and there's also a bit over

934
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:36,920
here so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this flags were there are</font>

935
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,328
some bits that are predefined to be

936
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,280
critical and some bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

937
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:42,020
predefined to be non critical and we can

938
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:46,190
have a critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> congestion experience</font>

939
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:48,650
flag over here so what happens is when

940
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:51,020
you have traffic from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end station</font>

941
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:53,480
the ingress our bridge copies the ecn

942
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:57,170
field from an IP header or if it happens

943
00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:04,460
to understand some other protocol into

944
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:06,680
the troll header and this is a then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

945
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,849
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through some transit playing it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

946
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,970
some of these transit link spine doc

947
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:13,130
sexy might not actually be ecn you know

948
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:17,299
aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> or but that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and if you get</font>

949
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:19,309
one where it is and there's congestion

950
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:22,099
experience namely they're cute but for

951
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:25,099
cues are too big or whatever it marks it

952
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:29,270
using the the critical flag and it

953
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:33,170
doesn't actually bother to check whether

954
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:36,288
the transport is ecn capable or not so

955
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:38,569
basically the ingress you should do this

956
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:40,160
copying the transit things just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

957
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:42,410
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they experienced congestion they set</font>

958
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,819
this bit long<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> word isn't</font>

959
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,828
there they may have to add the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word in</font>

960
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:48,410
because that's an optional word on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

961
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:51,140
header so when you get to the egress

962
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:56,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">then things get a little more complex so</font>

963
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:57,660
I if if let's assume this is a some

964
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:59,460
other kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic</font>

965
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:02,368
since you've marked a critical bit if

966
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:06,930
the egress doesn't understand easy at

967
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:09,510
all it will throw it away so it'll get

968
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:11,940
discarded only if the egress garbage

969
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:13,559
understands ECM will it do more

970
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,650
complicated manipulation on these bits

971
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,599
and possibly insert a marked thing into

972
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:24,750
the IP header which is d capsule<font color="#CCCCCC"> ating</font>

973
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:28,039
oh yeah let's again no hats but so when

974
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:30,780
I've seen ecn implemented in routers

975
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:34,079
it's generally that you're setting it's

976
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,730
as part of its part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the egress</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cueing</font>

977
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,460
or verbal cueing depending on what kind

978
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:41,130
of game you play but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is you</font>

979
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:43,829
set the bit as it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

980
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">queues which is frequently well after</font>

981
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:49,410
you've done any of your header

982
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:53,819
manipulation so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that you might</font>

983
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:56,038
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add a I would say if that's in</font>

984
00:50:53,819 --> 00:51:01,259
that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a such a router</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

985
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:04,319
perhaps add it in all cases I mean so I

986
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:07,980
would request that people who have

987
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware implementations take a serious</font>

988
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:13,289
look at this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if what you're</font>

989
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:16,589
saying is as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a CN you</font>

990
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:19,020
need to put the word in that's fine but

991
00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:21,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">they need to it that comes with its own</font>

992
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost and normally ecn doesn't really</font>

993
00:51:21,299 --> 00:51:26,970
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a heavy cost to implement um</font>

994
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:30,329
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that you're going to have</font>

995
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:33,000
the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am not as familiar with</font>

996
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:35,099
switches as i am with routers you know

997
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,829
Mia culpa why not that much difference

998
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:39,539
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I have seen of switches is</font>

999
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:45,000
pretty darn similar particularly at the

1000
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:48,569
qos level and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1001
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">describing would be if you're optionally</font>

1002
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:51,480
adding it when you see if you expect to

1003
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,339
optionally add it when you see

1004
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:58,589
convergent congestion um I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1005
00:51:56,339 --> 00:52:00,660
there's going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of uptake so</font>

1006
00:51:58,589 --> 00:52:01,799
really really really talk to folks who

1007
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,920
are doing the hardware implementation

1008
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:08,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay sure it needs be looked at more i</font>

1009
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,349
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in all forms of</font>

1010
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,579
compatibility really good and macro

1011
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:13,709
compatibility in

1012
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:16,019
real world if it's in a data center or

1013
00:52:13,709 --> 00:52:18,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">something very likely all these things</font>

1014
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:21,118
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same capability level so if</font>

1015
00:52:18,989 --> 00:52:22,859
some support is it's implausible that

1016
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,989
you have randomly scattered<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones it's</font>

1017
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:27,119
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> dcn and once it done and in which</font>

1018
00:52:24,989 --> 00:52:31,579
case the ingress will always add the

1019
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,579
word as part of the ingress in cap oh

1020
00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:37,919
yeah listen you of course have more

1021
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,519
familiarity with how trill is being

1022
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:48,359
deployed out there that i'm afraid i do

1023
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:51,299
but i don't say that it's like I think

1024
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:55,259
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the trill switch is is it a</font>

1025
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:58,619
real layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 router I mean it logically</font>

1026
00:52:55,259 --> 00:53:00,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">it throws away the layer 2 header look</font>

1027
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:02,849
at the next nickname and adds a new

1028
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:04,380
layer to header so it's it's it's really

1029
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:06,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">a router it just routes on nicknames</font>

1030
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:09,630
instead of on IP addresses what what I'm

1031
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:12,209
talking about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expecting to do</font>

1032
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:14,039
header manipulation at the qos about to

1033
00:53:12,209 --> 00:53:15,930
shove it out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> door stage yep that's</font>

1034
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,809
the part that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that's a good point I'm</font>

1035
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:19,859
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent point villain the I think</font>

1036
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:20,940
what any intuition you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have about</font>

1037
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:22,709
routers seems like it would be

1038
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:25,829
applicable recently for this sort of

1039
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:28,319
thing so I you know it was a pic

1040
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:30,930
applicable<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the ethernet switch I've</font>

1041
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:37,589
been fillet with I thought I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1042
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:42,589
talking about tunnels and yeah you want

1043
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:49,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">to join or want me to keep going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

1044
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:54,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is these are the rules that</font>

1045
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:59,640
it egress which are this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the classic</font>

1046
00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:00,930
rules and where you have a mark in the

1047
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,879
outer header which would be the trill

1048
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:04,940
header and a marking in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner header</font>

1049
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,369
which with the IP header most typically

1050
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:15,769
and how you combine those at the egress

1051
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:22,769
and this is the control case where you

1052
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:26,209
have three bits you're combining so it's

1053
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:26,209
a slightly different

1054
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:33,479
so what are the changes as a draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

1055
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">one has just been posted so there were</font>

1056
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,880
several wait several different options

1057
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:41,579
presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last time and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decided</font>

1058
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,200
to change from opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> three which</font>

1059
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:46,380
basically means changing from classic

1060
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:50,040
ecn to this technique to use a critical

1061
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:54,559
bit because that gets you the benefits

1062
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:56,849
of ecn to considerable extent without

1063
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,760
having to assure that the egress

1064
00:54:56,849 --> 00:55:00,780
supports ECM and actually yours doesn't

1065
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,460
support easy and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quite</font>

1066
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,430
get the benefits of ECM at least you get

1067
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:09,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic discarded so you get the IP</font>

1068
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:13,529
flow control rename the soups<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

1069
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:15,990
renamed a couple fields as indicated

1070
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:19,490
earlier and there's a now<font color="#E5E5E5"> a section in</font>

1071
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:22,290
the draft on support for ECM variants

1072
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:26,790
including free congestion notification

1073
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:30,509
and 0 4 s which had a successful boss on

1074
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tuesday and that's I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if I</font>

1075
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember the full expansion I don't put</font>

1076
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:36,619
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next it but it's right here</font>

1077
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:40,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">low-latency</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> low-loss scalable throughput</font>

1078
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:43,170
otherwise the data center TCC<font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind</font>

1079
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:47,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">of stuff and their graphs by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob it's</font>

1080
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:52,140
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and the idea is that you want</font>

1081
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:54,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discard with a an appropriate</font>

1082
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:58,470
probability and if you do things right

1083
00:55:54,150 --> 00:56:04,049
which this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the classic q and this is</font>

1084
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:07,259
the one L<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4sq does you can get a very</font>

1085
00:56:04,049 --> 00:56:12,540
low latency with Rowley low loss and

1086
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:14,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-throughput so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a this is</font>

1087
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,020
not required or anything with troll but

1088
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:20,990
the markings that are being done the

1089
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:20,990
support tab so if the egress supports

1090
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:26,098
ecn and does these regulations and bit

1091
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:27,900
combinations indicated here you end up

1092
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:29,849
essentially with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4s support without</font>

1093
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:35,339
actually having to have any elf RS logic

1094
00:56:29,849 --> 00:56:36,359
at the egress so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should review</font>

1095
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:40,259
the draft

1096
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:43,288
and I guess a second ensue<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I want</font>

1097
00:56:40,259 --> 00:56:47,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try to have a working group adoption</font>

1098
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:49,589
call issued effectively at this point so

1099
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:51,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">people should vote for a couple of</font>

1100
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:53,279
public option call and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1101
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:59,880
comment on the list and hopefully after

1102
00:56:53,279 --> 00:57:02,519
reviewing the document was there any

1103
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,190
discussion know what every point your

1104
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:06,328
vision yeah and it you can ask deeper

1105
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:11,880
questions that I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer it's</font>

1106
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:15,239
vaguely Bob 0 we can adjourn to a prior

1107
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:17,220
you know small discussion that's not

1108
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:21,660
marked by the working group it's up to

1109
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:24,480
you but this this draft yeah so anyways

1110
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:26,640
it's only our car 23 minutes at the end

1111
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:31,440
of the session anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we got</font>

1112
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:35,879
stuff all packed in this time but nobody

1113
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,910
has questions or comments oh yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1114
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,799
well thank you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much thank you for</font>

1115
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:49,489
active participation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and working on</font>

1116
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:49,489
this ok I've got notes how<font color="#E5E5E5"> uploaded</font>

1117
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:08,669
solutions thank you take those there

1118
00:58:05,759 --> 00:58:14,099
isn't anybody after registration desk so

1119
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:21,210
I you know why it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1120
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:26,700
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> different yeah I mean tonight if</font>

I have 15 minutes before it with some of

1125
00:58:48,029 --> 00:59:01,920
them no actually I s in darts known as

1126
00:58:56,609 --> 00:59:05,489
the model Christian<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know yes and I</font>

1127
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:11,029
the low if unhook that kind of set which

1128
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:14,420
tied up<font color="#CCCCCC"> but nine first look at later</font>

1129
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:18,799
okay he will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on my direction and so I</font>

1130
