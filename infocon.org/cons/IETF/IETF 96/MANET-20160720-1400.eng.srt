<font color="#E5E5E5">other issues or other other things that</font>

24
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:57,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group overview we have not met</font>

25
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the last two ITF this is the first</font>

26
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:03,979
one we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a while we've had some</font>

27
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:06,839
interim meetings we were we were on the

28
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:08,699
we were put they put to task to finish

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,860
up the documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had and get</font>

30
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,859
them out we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very close to doing that</font>

31
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going to go over the whole issue</font>

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,880
and the whole happenstance with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> odv</font>

33
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,069
be to that happened if you'd like to

34
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to me after this I'm more than</font>

35
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:30,040
happy to talk to anybody who wants to

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about that we have deal app is</font>

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,569
moving forward they're still comments

38
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,410
going on on the list that's still an ad

39
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:43,869
review ad review hopefully we'll get

40
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:48,459
that cleared out relatively soon the

41
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:50,019
other one is on my plate is OS r seck

42
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,700
threats the information one we had a

43
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,530
last call we didn't have really any

44
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,690
comments on that so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

45
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,380
upon myself to do a thorough<font color="#CCCCCC"> review and</font>

46
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,900
either write up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shepherd document or</font>

47
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,120
not I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it'll be a big deal</font>

48
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:09,519
but I do owe them at least a thorough

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:11,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">review of that um the rest are</font>

50
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,750
proceeding nicely and the only other

51
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,298
document that is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in limbo right</font>

52
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">now is the OLS our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multipath document</font>

53
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:22,239
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of discussion between</font>

54
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,518
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> author and Christie R love who's had</font>

55
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,680
a lot of really nice comments on the

56
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,600
draft it would be nice to have more eyes

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,670
on that draft it had passed last call

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,560
Chris got in some very pertinent

59
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,780
comments right after that so we pulled

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,390
it back we did it again and it's still

61
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:44,290
kind of in limbo they're working out the

62
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:46,238
details and until they kind of agree and

63
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,700
I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them or Stan agrees with</font>

64
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,820
them it's going to sit where it's at so

65
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,500
please read that draft and get comments

66
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,920
back I think it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a useful thing to</font>

67
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,350
have if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it right I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

68
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:05,798
break things when we do it that's the

69
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:08,200
main thing for me we did get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two rfcs</font>

70
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:14,109
since the last time we met<font color="#CCCCCC"> or actually</font>

71
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:16,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">since this year I debased signatures</font>

72
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:19,180
that's been in limbo and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> G for a long</font>

73
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,720
long long time they<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally got it</font>

74
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,320
through and the dap metric for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all srb2</font>

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,320
past

76
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:37,940
so on to the next anyone have any

77
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:42,650
comments or<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions about the status</font>

78
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:48,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">we we missed a slide on our current</font>

79
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:49,590
milestones and deliverables so I don't

80
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,590
have a slide on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right now i can</font>

81
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,448
i'll try to pull it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end we do</font>

82
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,270
have some milestones coming up and

83
00:04:54,449 --> 00:05:00,630
they're relatively tight schedule they

84
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,270
include many management and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

85
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,740
we deploy mayonnaise lots of people have

86
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,479
been asking for that outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

87
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,940
working group and we've had two attempts

88
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,219
at that before and they kind of missed

89
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,710
the mark on either end either too

90
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,250
generic or too specific so we want

91
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">something kind of in the middle so</font>

92
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,940
authors of those two documents i would

93
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:25,199
encourage you to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come together</font>

94
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:30,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">and work on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i see one of them james</font>

95
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:34,080
here hopefully oricon and thomas are

96
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:38,550
interested in working on that again but

97
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,520
others are welcome as well and the other

98
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:45,750
ones are dlf extensions olsr maintenance

99
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,389
or other extensions 20 srb2 and the man

100
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,759
a fib man a multicast fib which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

101
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,979
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give a presentation on and I</font>

102
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,800
need more people participating in that

103
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,750
and hopefully this will help facilitate

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,270
some discussions on how we restructure

105
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,270
this so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

106
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:26,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we are as a song we are tasked</font>

107
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,859
with designing a forwarding information

108
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,150
base for multicast in mayonnaise so I'm

109
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be presenting a little bit</font>

110
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,650
about what we've learned at NRL with our

111
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,020
implementation of SMF and our

112
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,710
implementation of elastic multicast

113
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,409
which Brian presented a few I TFS back

114
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,030
kind of the structure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our code</font>

115
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,280
because in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide and kind of</font>

116
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we've learned in what's missing in</font>

117
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,049
the current SMF draft and how we can

118
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture it in another draft and separate</font>

119
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,370
things out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit better so real</font>

120
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,080
quick background SMF is a simplified

121
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:03,300
multicast forwarding protocol and

122
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,940
experimental and the man a working group

123
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,130
it does man a wide broadcasts it doesn't

124
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,750
allow you to limit where the broadcast

125
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,690
goes it goes all the way through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the man</font>

126
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,810
a network they uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDSs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connected</font>

127
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:20,320
dominating sets much like olsr and other

128
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:22,419
many routing protocols it devotes a lot

129
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,130
of the text in there to duplicate packet

130
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:25,810
detection and at the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't know</font>

131
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,940
what worked and what didn't it has both

132
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,840
hash based and I debased mechanisms and

133
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,180
we found through practice that it

134
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,789
depends on your network your traffic

135
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,680
your device<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you want to use so</font>

136
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,479
we're kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaning right now to</font>

137
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,890
leaving them both in there as optional

138
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,359
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some networks you want</font>

139
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,849
to use hash and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some that you</font>

140
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,430
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use ID it really depends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on what</font>

141
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,380
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> network you're using with hash</font>

142
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,790
certain traffic patterns will give you a

143
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,110
lot of false positives and you'll end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

144
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:57,100
dropping a lot of packets that you

145
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:01,180
otherwise would want similarly with hash

146
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,780
you can end up draining your batteries

172
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,300
would work and there is some merit to

00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,430
doing kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a hybrid where you mark</font>

177
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,380
and it's they're not intended to scale a

178
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,120
large networks because you're flooding

179
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:27,230

188
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,920
performance suffers because of that when

189
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,120
you're scraping all the packets up in

190

191
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,040
back down so we want a better design

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,440
where we have a forwarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit that all</font>

194
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,270

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,070

that way so it people can implement it

200
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,390
that way easily packets right now are

201
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,820
disseminated like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said to the entire</font>

where everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants to hear all the</font>

205
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,170
that's really not good so there's also

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,920
no

207
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:39,139

man a wants a specific multicast address

or not if anyone's listening or not you

generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the multicast on a radio</font>

258
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:46,700
there are other algorithms and very

only one neighbor on that link don't

00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,700
wants it to go somewhere but this guy

293
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,040
over here wants you to go somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

294
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,930
so you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this even though it's the</font>

295
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,060
same packet you wanted to go out a

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:33,229
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface even though the</font>

297
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:35,630

298
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,940
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick overview of our NRL SMF</font>

299
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:41,180
and what it does it's open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

300
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,530
at PF dub and RL Navy dot mil if you

301
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,969
want to get the source code you can talk

302
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:52,040
to me it works with NRL<font color="#E5E5E5"> NH DP it works</font>

303
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:55,250
with ospf MDR algorithms and we have

304
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,339
that code as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and it works with our</font>

305
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,410
olsr v1 implementation RV two

306
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:05,019
implementations not open source yet

307
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,019
just some process alone getting it<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

308
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:15,019
it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a remote control interface that</font>

309
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:17,269
we've defined it that that interface is

310
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:19,339
not defined in the SMF draft because the

311
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:21,860
draft just says either flood or not you

312
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:24,139
use these algorithms or not SMF is one

313
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,810
big happy thing well we separated<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

314
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:28,069
out the algorithmic control is in the

315
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,739
routing protocols or the neighbor

316
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:32,269
discovery protocol and sm f is the

317
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,790
forwarding engine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> forwarding bit and</font>

318
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:37,040
it has we have a very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> api to</font>

319
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,689
control it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to expand on that</font>

320
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,469
because there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that the</font>

321
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:45,800
forwarding engine can do that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

322
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:48,319
opening<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the api to do we know what we</font>

323
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,550
want but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defined that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> api yet</font>

324
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:52,069
it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very simple because the</font>

325
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:54,258
algorithms don't define those well it's

326
00:15:52,069 --> 00:16:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">still very simple yes you forward on all</font>

327
00:15:54,259 --> 00:16:04,540
interfaces no you don't next slide so

328
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:07,160
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a current SMF architecture and</font>

329
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:12,079
one thing to note here is the SMF

330
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:14,509
interfaces on the left it can take in

331
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,069
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiple different interfaces so</font>

332
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:18,769
you can have multiple physical

333
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:21,349
interfaces and have them map to a single

334
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,779
SMF interface that then does duplicate

335
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,420
package detection it puts it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on</font>

336
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:29,509
various SMF interfaces that are also

337
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,479
mapped to physical interfaces so that it

338
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:34,130
can reef or word on a set a subset or

339
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,930
all of the interfaces that you're

340
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">running on and you can have different</font>

341
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,800
rules associated with those outbound

342
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:48,620
interfaces so you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like</font>

343
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:52,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ricci</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Qin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stew yeah ID next slide so</font>

344
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,050
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a conceptual slide again</font>

345
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:57,290
illustrating that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate</font>

346
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,569
out the control from the forwarding and

347
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,490
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another little bit here and that</font>

348
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:04,639
the 14 information base should be a

349
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:09,020
conceptual design on what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fording</font>

350
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">engine uses it's not it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be it</font>

351
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,668
should be kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a table and NH DP</font>

352
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,270
that it defines the table and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

353
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:16,550
operate but

354
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,050
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily a physical thing</font>

355
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,740
and it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be represented in the 40</font>

356
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:24,010
engine in some other way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

357
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:29,960
arrow going back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control plane</font>

358
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:32,930
and that is for our work in elastic

359
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,610
multicast we needed feedback on what new

360
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,740
packets were coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

361
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,810
what to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them because if you're</font>

362
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,850
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do group based stuff you need</font>

363
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,620
to know what's happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

364
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,250
and if you want to forward that packet

365
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:50,530
or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's into more detail in a second</font>

366
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:53,480
next slide so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our current design</font>

367
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,910
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have n</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTP or another control</font>

368
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,000
algorithm up at the top you have your SF

369
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,340
s MF management<font color="#CCCCCC"> nib and the mid is kind</font>

370
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,140
of in pieces as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because some of it</font>

371
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,209
controls the algorithm and that goes

372
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,190
over to na GP and some of it controls

373
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,260
what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your duplicate</font>

374
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,640
pocket detection and re sequencing on

375
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,640
interfaces and that sort of thing and

376
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,070
that goes down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your SMF instance down</font>

377
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,340
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom so the SMF mibbe is kind</font>

378
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:22,550
of talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to both pieces because of how</font>

379
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">the SMF was designed i'm julia scrubber</font>

380
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,419
check again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a moment of</font>

381
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,480
inattention so perhaps you've mentioned

382
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,980
it are you describing the architecture

383
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">or something that has been implemented</font>

384
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">or is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your plan for something that</font>

385
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is this has been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> implemented this</font>

386
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">has been in place we've implemented this</font>

387
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:43,280
and the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is available the code is</font>

388
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:45,310
available and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually are we have</font>

389
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,040
some limited amount of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMF</font>

390
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:51,980
management mid available as well James

391
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,020
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information on that but</font>

392
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:58,880
we did we did do some of the mid design

393
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:00,350
as well and I say undefined algorithmic

394
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:06,590
control here even though we have our own

395
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">API that talks it uses depending on your</font>

396
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,070
system it uses different methods of

397
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,139
talking from one instance to another of

398
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,240
two different damon's running but it's

399
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,180
undefined in terms of the documents

400
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,060
we've defined an API that allows you to

401
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">control the SMF it's not as rich as we'd</font>

402
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:26,409
like we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand that a little</font>

403
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,410
bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide</font>

404
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:33,350
so we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to to change to</font>

405
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,200
something more like this where there's a

406
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,539
richer amount of filters and state in

407
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,490
SMF that you're going to control

408
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:42,770
affording information base you're going

409

to control on this standardized<font color="#E5E5E5"> fording</font>

define what is allowed and not allowed

441
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,809
specifically what the messages look like

442
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,690
and how they're getting past but how it

443
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:20,360
can be changed to point in a strong

444
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,850
direction on an API that could be

445

448
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,010
whether it happens within the work and

449
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:37,120
growth or no doesn't matter but working

450
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,120
the nike eyes is a good thing

451

of elastic multi-gas and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presenting</font>

457
00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:00,019
recap on elastic multicast it its<font color="#CCCCCC"> uses</font>

458
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:04,070
SMF to broadcast out all the multicast

459
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:07,789
traffic SMF informs a controller when

460
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:10,939
new flows are happening the<font color="#CCCCCC"> controller</font>

461
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:13,250
will then send out acts to see who wants

462
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">this if anyone wants this and if no one</font>

463
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,259
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it ends up turning off that</font>

464
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:20,330
flow so it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of</font>

465
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:22,820
flooding happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network and</font>

466
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:27,199
it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple method of doing it it</font>

467
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:31,460
uses multicast joins and acts to see

468
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,210
who's joined and then it kind of it and

469
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:37,070
it also takes into account very dynamics

470
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,809
so if your network is very dynamic it

471
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,210
won't slow things down as much and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

472
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:43,070
will let it flood around more brian has

473
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,519
more on that in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> previous</font>

474
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:50,539
presentations the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing here is</font>

475
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:53,419
that there's feedback and there's

476
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:55,519
dynamic expansion and contraction of the

477
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:59,029
multicast trees and meshes that are

478
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:01,190
being built another key thing is that

479
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">its flow based and I'll get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a</font>

480
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:08,750
minute next again just illustrating that

481
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:12,740
for elastic multicast to work and other

482
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:15,639
algorithms one that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a multicast</font>

483
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,440
algorithm but it is an algorithm is

484
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:19,490
reactive protocols need to know when a

485
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,740
packet is going out and there's no

486
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,620
destination so they inform up higher so

487
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:27,019
something like this could work for a

488
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:30,500
unicast routing protocol or be used by

489
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:33,500
it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback feature is kind of</font>

490
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:39,559
important and the flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

491
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:43,309
what i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by flow in a minute so what</font>

492
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:44,928
do I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by flow generally in SMF we</font>

493
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:47,750
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about addresses it's a multi</font>

494
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:49,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">gas okay do we flood yes or no that's</font>

495
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">really simple it's too simple and it's</font>

496
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:54,260
not efficient

497
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:56,809
so in our SMF implementation we have an

498
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,559
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flow and a flow and contains</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

499
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:02,330
destination source or protocol and

500
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:05,270
nominally an incoming interface so you

501
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:08,539
can categorize a packet based upon this

502
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,340
flow and that's kind of how it's how

503
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:13,280
it's being routed is based upon its flow

504
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:19,760
ID and its flow isn't going to really

505
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:23,750
change and we're still working on we

506
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,030
have some we have this working there are

507
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,130
other ways to make this work<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well it</font>

508
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:31,250
can get really complicated you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

509
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:34,179
a default way of say if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's multicast I</font>

510
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:38,059
flooded<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on my interfaces I inform</font>

511
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:39,559
higher up and then if it's a if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

512
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific multicast I know no one's</font>

513
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:43,399
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> I drop it because it</font>

514
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,260
matches that source destination and I

515
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:50,929
know that no one's interested in that

516
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:53,840
flow so I dress drop it next so what do

517
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:55,909
we do what do we do with the flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we</font>

518
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,530
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ford</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it or drop it well we found</font>

519
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:58,970
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't just forward it or drop it</font>

520
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,820
there are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things we want</font>

521
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:04,549
to do and our implementation right now

522
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,260
has you either forward it you can

523
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:10,250
forward it with a limited rate so we

524
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:12,440
have a cue that limits how many packets

525
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:19,520
can go out at a certain rate that gives

526
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:20,720
you a priority<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically priority or you</font>

527
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,270
can reduce the amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow you get</font>

528
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,559
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> control we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hybrid I don't</font>

529
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the name of that but hybrid what</font>

530
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,918
that does is it sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a fixed number</font>

531
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,720
of packets for upper flow and then it

532
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,159
shuts it down and what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows it to</font>

533
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,190
do is it goes throughout the network

534
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,960
everyone gets the packet they can do

535
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,210
their protocol mechanisms that they need

536
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and they either inform or not</font>

537
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,320
inform to allow a lasting multicast to

538
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,120
shut it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not so a hybrid kind of</font>

539
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,918
lets it go for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit and then</font>

540
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">shuts it off with nothing else is said</font>

541
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,820
and then we can we can drop it and then

542
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,610
some other ones we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been playing</font>

543
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,980
around with are we can queue it up for

544
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,049
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ODB you can queue up a</font>

545
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,030
packet and wait first fixed amount of

546
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:05,360
time and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it or you can send an</font>

547
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:11,770
air

548
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,770
just to like no route those are ideas

549
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:18,230
again stressing that the the the

550
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,629
forwarding information base should not

551
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,460
just be a unidirectional flow of

552
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,200
information the foreign information base

553
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,610
should send stuff back up to the

554
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:31,940
controller based upon the flow and

555
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:34,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's happening next and as I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

557
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:38,000
this with only multicast in mind is it

558
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,750
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for other things are we getting</font>

559
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">too deep do we just scope this and not</font>

560
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:48,799
worry about it or can we design it with

561
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:51,439
other other<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-man 8 protocols in</font>

562
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:55,960

<font color="#E5E5E5">liking the way you're going with this</font>

568
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:10,370
fib stuff I like the idea of a

569
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,140
generalized conceptual data model that

570
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can be extended out beyond just</font>

571
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,590
multicast perhaps I not sure how far

572
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,409
that's going to go but I'm very

573
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:20,899

about managing this ephemera bellucci

wondering whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you spoken to</font>

hairs lovely knows a great deal and we

585
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,020
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to integrate I think we</font>

586
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:53,900
should be interfacing with them rather

587
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,418
than inventing our own little bespoke

588
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,160
solution and discovering that the big

589

595
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,030
cross over to the management discussion

596
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,830
is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should be looking at some</font>

00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that I to RS are doing with</font>

00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:37,409
has been working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the net mod guys</font>

604
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:40,799
quite a bit they're still I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

605
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:43,799
something lost in translation there for

606
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:48,570
them to understand the requirements from

607
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:50,789
a router for example so if you can come

608

up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with requirements an ideal what is</font>

609
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:55,830
really needed from them right then

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's something that not only we can</font>

616
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,270
presentation is I mean it's coming from

617
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:18,720
our experience working with SMF and how

618
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:20,309
our protocol suite has evolved and we're

619
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,549
current trying to capture that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way</font>

620
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:27,809
that is more useful than just a one-off

621
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:30,418
implementation is it time for general

622
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:32,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this yes I'm I</font>

623
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:38,309
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was my last slide okay oh</font>

624
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:42,330
this was just a slide showing that we're

625
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:45,299
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at real code in kernels that are</font>

626
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:49,020
and how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> modify them to get some</font>

627
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:50,700
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of forwarding engine in them in an</font>

628
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,100
easy way that was all that was the last

629
00:29:50,700 --> 00:30:02,309
night yes open open for questions

630
00:29:53,100 --> 00:30:04,610
comments well my first question is let's

631
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:07,200
say you had several multicast groups

632
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,600
would you expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a different</font>

633
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,049
instance of this for each multicast

634
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,090
group yeah you would have different 14

635
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:16,350
based upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flow and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their flows</font>

636
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,330
being different groups would be

637
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:21,658
different so you'd have different rules

638
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:25,799
based upon their very low for different

639
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:27,760
group memberships yes you different

640
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,790
group memberships

641
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,260
the group membership part is part of the

642
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,710
control algorithm that's going to

643
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,240
control what groups get forwarded or not

644
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:39,940
but in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the forwarding base it's</font>

645
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:44,230
just another identifier on a flow it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

646
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:45,970
multicast address the group address so

647
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah you could you could flood certain</font>

648
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,620
group addresses you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can send other group</font>

649
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,000
addresses out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different interface you</font>

650
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,979
can have different rules based upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

651
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,490
the group address but we we consider

652
00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:01,300
them just it the group address is just

653
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:03,270
one key part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flow identifier right</font>

654
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,649
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dirt mean there could be some</font>

655
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">columbia i'm not sure but maybe some</font>

656
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:11,050
danger let's say you had 500 nodes or a

657
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:13,480
thousand nodes in the network and there

658
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:15,490
were three of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them were scattered you</font>

659
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,300
know to get to be part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a multicast</font>

660
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:23,500
group then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> total amount of control</font>

661
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:25,570
signaling to find them somehow could

662
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,280
even be worse than just flooding I don't

663
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:32,169
know depending on the mobility and

664
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:35,170
besides that well for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance I'd the</font>

665
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:38,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">original motivation for SMF I think to a</font>

666
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:41,320
large degree was because flooding is so

667
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:43,330
inefficient and NPR's and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdss can</font>

668
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,210
reduce the amount of control traffic by

669
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,399
upwards of sixty percent you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for</font>

670
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:51,910
those those networks right so to give

671
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">you a quick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overview real quick the last</font>

672
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,770
multicast work we did worked exactly how

673
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:59,230
you're saying a use of CD s it uses a

674
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:02,440
default SMF algorithm it gets sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

675
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:03,730
it would use the hybrid method of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 14 out</font>

676
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,390
the packet so they would get sent out

677
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:09,070
then the controllers would would be told

678
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,840
hey we got this multicast packet what do

679
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,030
you want to do and they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> send out</font>

680
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,860
messages the control would send out

681
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,500
extra messages using n HTTP and other

682
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,050
messages to say does anyone want<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

683
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,360
stuff or you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to join this group and</font>

684
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:23,950
if no one said yes they would turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

685
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,370
flow off they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn that group off</font>

686
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:29,350
and as people<font color="#E5E5E5"> said yes they would keep</font>

687
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:32,350
it on they would add a rules to do it

688
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:35,679
instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hybrid approach they would</font>

689
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,050
do the CD s flooding so at worst case it

690
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,280
would work the same as CD s flooding

691
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:41,379
best case it would prune off everything

692
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,670
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would it wouldn't flood at all</font>

693
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:49,480
can can I ask at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were</font>

694
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:51,700
over time so can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we then pick this up</font>

695
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,470
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meaning or take to the list</font>

696
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,630
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me just make one</font>

697
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,820
more sentence which is that you know if

698
00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:01,840
it turns out that managing a lot of

699
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:03,490
group memberships is complicated it

700
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,620
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> still be nice to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into effect</font>

701
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,900
what you've got just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the basic</font>

702
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:10,540
flooding operations as though you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

703
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,510
say a first step that's almost universal

704
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:16,540
there's there there is a draft elastic

705
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:19,450
multicast at<font color="#CCCCCC"> brian has written and it's</font>

706
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:21,970
out there you can read that on we

707
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,530
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to step back to build it in the</font>

708
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:27,490
right way instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just moving forward</font>

709
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:29,710
with it okay so okay well while we're

710
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:32,230
transitioning to the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation I</font>

711
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:33,880
want to ask where is the blue sheet and

712
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:36,430
are there people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who haven't signed the</font>

713
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,170
blue sheet there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks that</font>

714
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:47,980
haven't signed it do we know where it's

715
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:57,490
at I'm wait then we started again doing

716
00:33:47,980 --> 00:34:05,080
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I wanted to give a</font>

717
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:11,560
quick update on Dale up status as a seat

also an ad review the ad came back with

00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,450
comments they have not been fully

743
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:35,109
addressed yet so it has not been

744
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:37,240
resubmitted to the ad the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest issue</font>

745
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:40,359
revolves around credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> window</font>

progress so next slide please the other

748
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,109
thing I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about was an</font>

extension that's not yet been submitted

to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group the one that were</font>

00:35:51,640 --> 00:36:01,328
chartered for we had talked for a couple

752
00:35:57,069 --> 00:36:04,300
of I ETFs now about deal up extensions

753
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:07,740
for metrics by traffic class are

754
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:12,190
essentially metrics by dscp code point

755
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:18,040
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm writing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

758
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:26,500
and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get that posted we can talk</font>

759
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,440
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the list to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make the</font>

760
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:32,050
necessary changes and try to drive for

761
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,450
first thing would be accepting it as a

762
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:37,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group document and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we'll go</font>

763

forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the work is in work is in</font>

764
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:44,290
process and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got</font>

765
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:48,430

766
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:51,040
the microphone so Rick Taylor can I just

767
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:53,828
say I have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of personal drafts</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> other deal app extensions that once</font>

770
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,339
will revisit they've currently expired<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

771
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,440
want to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> them back to the working</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">group and ask for adoption for them just</font>

773
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,280
as a heads up okay since we're reach our

774
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,920
turd for day life extensions that would

775
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,170
be fantastic

776
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">lubra or 2 comments so metrics bike</font>

777
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,820
traffic class<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds interesting I'd be</font>

778
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,400
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interested to see how you manage</font>

779
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:21,790
the mapping of traffic classes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cues</font>

780
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,740
and because usually it's the cues that

781
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,700
have the metrics not necessarily traffic

782
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,620
classes because you have multiple

783
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:31,029
traffic classes mapping the same cues so

784
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:34,210
that'll be interesting and have you

785
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:39,340
thought about credit by traffic class or

786
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:41,170
bike you uh let's see have I thought

787
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:46,390
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it no does it sound interesting</font>

788
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:49,780
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I've seen some some folks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

789
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:51,580
working with have a couple of thoughts

790
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">on that topic as well as some other</font>

791
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:58,480
extensions so I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect them to</font>

792
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,880
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in also between now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next</font>

793
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,030
IETF and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll line up nicely</font>

794
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:09,940
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can just collapse them yeah that</font>

795
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:16,480
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks ok any other</font>

796
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:18,850
questions on delay wait wait one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

797
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,610
authors has a question under yeah this

00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,839
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> haha</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's Rick Taylor again it's</font>

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,240
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dealer question it's a process</font>

that he and some of his guys he's

802
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,620
working with also have some extensions

803
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,089
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how familiar people are</font>

804
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,380
with the inner workings of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dean up of</font>

805
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,240
course you've all read all the drafts

806
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,600
because you've come come to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

807
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,700
group the extension mechanism is within

deal appears both parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> announced the</font>

809
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,399
extensions they support as part of the

00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:51,220
negotiation at session initialization

811
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:55,270
does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group one an extension</font>

812
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:56,890
per document<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft or are you happy</font>

813
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,660
to work on a draft which says and this

814
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,900
draft introduces three new extensions

815
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:04,660
that each may be independently and

816
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:08,800
provided by an implementation how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

817
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:10,180
want this managed I from from my

818
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,190
perspective and I haven't I haven't

819
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked back at my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chair you you hit me</font>

cold with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but it just came to me</font>

821
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,970
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lou said he's got three up his</font>

822
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:21,100
sleeves like it's whatever makes sense i

823
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:26,279
mean i could see a document

824
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:29,980
please hi Lou burger my experience is

825
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:33,400
having a independently implemented thing

826
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:35,140
per document really helps when when when

827
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,400
users and vendors are trying to

828
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,370
understand what it is that they're

829
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually delivering or requesting in an</font>

830
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:44,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">RFP that doesn't care if it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

831
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">be delivered as a set sure do it in the</font>

832
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,310
same document but call it one extension

833
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,610
that that's a fair point if you're gonna

834
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:53,320
have multiple extensions um yeah i agree

835
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,820
with you or or if they're all required

836
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,130
together you know if you have three

837
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,950
extensions but<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation is</font>

838
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,630
required<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to implement all of them</font>

839
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:05,859
sure but if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to implement</font>

840
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:07,540
only one of three separate just as Rick

841
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:11,530
Taylor again<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as a follow on from</font>

842
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:14,080
that I understood I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid having</font>

843
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:15,580
optional optional things again so i said

844
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,560
i have one document with three

845
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,810
extensions which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go hand in hand</font>

846
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,720
but actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm only supporting one of</font>

847
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:24,190
them out of the such a set of three so i

848
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">think a little bit of care needs to be</font>

849
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:31,120
taken with this I like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Julia</font>

850
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,490
scrubber check I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull in the</font>

851
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,460
other direction I like big documents

852
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,899
that have a single introduction and you

853
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,640
understand what you're reading and

854
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,410
there's an order and as you are

855
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,270
implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get all the background</font>

856
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:45,879
in a single document rather than chasing

857
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:48,550
pointers between hundreds of documents

858
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,290
and so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to encourage the</font>

859
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,700
group I know it's more difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

860
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,680
group and it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult for the</font>

861
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,470
editors but I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage</font>

862
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,620
the group to make big documents list of

863
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:02,379
contacts and few of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think I as</font>

864
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:04,600
I interpret the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> blue made its that</font>

865
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:07,990
as a vendor it's hard to go to your

866
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:14,549
customers and say I support sections 38

867
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:17,350
and 17 of RFC 8989 right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes that's not</font>

868
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:19,540
really a good deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not a good</font>

869
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,640
idea so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to write the</font>

870
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:24,610
document you either support what's in it

871
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,500
or you don't so it lends credence to the

872
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,690
idea from a functional perspective get

873
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,460
it down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's bountiful</font>

874
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,960
and quantifiable and then publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

875
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,340
and you need to publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple</font>

876
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,330
documents if you're doing multiple

877
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,550
things

878
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:40,450
he's absolutely right and I'm right<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

879
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:42,310
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he has he's pulling in the direction</font>

880
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,080
that's convenient for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor I'm</font>

881
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:46,570
pulling in the direction that's

882
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,610
convenient for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implementer you're</font>

883
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,590
probably pooling in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the direction that's</font>

884
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:52,930
convenient<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the chair and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll end</font>

885
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,730
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the point that suits everyone or</font>

886
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:59,589
nobody a nanny for watching we'll pull

887
00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:01,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">it apart once again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a poor attempt</font>

888
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:04,930
at humor blue burger I'm pulling in the

889
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:08,140
direction of the user yeah not of not of

890
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:11,379
the vendor I actually care more about

891
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:13,600
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user who says I want RFC XYZ</font>

892
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:16,900
because I want function that's very

893
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:20,350
function so when I specify an RFC I

894
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,400
don't have I don't know if there's too

895
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:23,950
many options I don't know what I'm going

896
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get and what's really cool is if you</font>

897
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,950
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough options and I've personally</font>

898
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,900
been involved with a spec that failed

899
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,390
this way if you have too many options

900
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,950
you can get to vendors that say they

901
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:35,109
implement the same RFC and they don't

902
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,480
interoperate or deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing</font>

903
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:42,490
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing our job if we do</font>

904
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:44,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the real issue Rick</font>

905
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:46,660
Taylor again<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take you up on Judas's</font>

906
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,340
first point which was I like a big

907
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,649
document because I like all the intro

908
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:53,140
stuff in one place it is in one place

909
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:56,230
it's called dealer I we're talking about

910
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:58,299
extensions to a core document that

911
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:01,090
describes what it is how you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

912
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,770
what's the minimal you must support so i

913
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,660
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've kind of satisfied that</font>

914
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:07,440
requirement the rest are really

915
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:12,720
appendices published after the date for

916
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:15,340
loose reasons which I do agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

917
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">john diet lied I'd like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak from</font>

918
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point of view the poor people who</font>

919
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,990
have to specify what it is that they're

920
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:26,890
buying because I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've ever</font>

921
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:29,169
seen a<font color="#E5E5E5"> product listed with the sponsor a</font>

922
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:31,990
section of an RFC it's a the neuro say

923
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:34,480
or isn't and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the people</font>

924
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:36,339
specifying have limited technical

925
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,560
expertise and they go right so do we use

926
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,270
this document or do we not and so I

927
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally would like to see it split</font>

928
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:44,950
out as several RSC's and also that means

929
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,980
they can be worked on independently we

930
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:50,169
can say yes or no to each one and

931
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:55,240
you know it becomes easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work with</font>

932
00:43:50,170 --> 00:44:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">all together okay points</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taken any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

935
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,500
would do this thank you for giving me

working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on bed for more than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years</font>

947
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:16,900
now it's also part of a linux kernel and

948
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:20,109
we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce our research</font>

949
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:22,840
project called mesmerized we would like

950
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:25,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your feedback for us it's the</font>

951
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,400
first time at the IDF meeting and we

952
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,740
would also like to understand if this is

953
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,369
like material for our<font color="#CCCCCC"> sees how to split</font>

954
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:36,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">but how to publish it and maybe also get</font>

955
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:39,070
you to collaborate with us yeah so

956
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,170
feedback would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very welcome I plan to</font>

957
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:44,800
do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation in 10 to 15 minutes</font>

958
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:47,800
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brief but yeah I hope</font>

959
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get a glance so next slide</font>

960
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:57,730
please<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so basically mesmerized as a</font>

961
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:59,799
multipath opportunistic mesh routing

962
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,220
protocol which is based on network

963
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,160
coding

964
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:07,730
we want to exploit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadcast nature</font>

965
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:12,259
because many routing protocols which are

966
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:17,869
also standardized on the yeah use mud

967
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:21,460
unicast routing and one of innovative

968
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:24,320
things is but we just don't have

969
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,930
repeaters which just forward messages as

970
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:30,470
they are but we have relay nodes which

971
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:32,089
recode using network coding<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

972
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:36,230
explain that in a minute so our

973
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:41,060
objectives is mostly high resilience to

974
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:42,710
topology changes and if possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

975
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">aggregate throughput I think that's</font>

976
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:50,720
already known from our<font color="#CCCCCC"> multipath</font>

977
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:54,759
approaches<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok next slide please so very</font>

978
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:58,848
brief introduction to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar coding</font>

979
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:00,680
typically in a Wi-Fi network you send

980
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:04,580
just packets they all have a sequence

981
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:06,919
number and if lost packets when you

982
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:09,980
would just reset them based on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

983
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of feedback a network coding you just</font>

984
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:14,240
don't send the packets as is but you

985
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,380
combine them to create linear

986
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:21,290
combinations<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these packets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you attach</font>

987
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:23,810
a vector coding vector which describes

988
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:27,020
what kind of packets have been combined

989
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:29,630
and how and on the receiver side you can

990
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:33,920
solve a linear system and recover the

991
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:37,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">original packets and in that way you</font>

992
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:40,400
don't need specific retransmissions you

993
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:44,779
just need a sufficient number of packets

994
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:49,790
received so you you can solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> for in</font>

995
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:52,400
your system<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right one interesting</font>

996
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:56,390
feature you get the fat linear

997
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,820
combinations is recoding so is you see

998
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,940
we have three notes here encode a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rico</font>

999
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,290
down the decoder and the encoder sends

1000
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,720
two packets which are linear

1001
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,940
combinations and as you can see the

00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:31,839
choosing specific packets but also a

1009
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:34,098
recorder might have got different

1010
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,109
packets because i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> often when loss and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">if they only got some of them well then</font>

1012
00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:44,630
never slide here next please so you see

1013
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:47,299
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that lets taking the second</font>

1014
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,920
and the third on top and combining those

1015
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:56,619
two a new packet which has been sent and

1016
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:56,619
received by the decoder ok next<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

1017
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:02,210
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good about network coding net</font>

1018
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:06,920
recording<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's resilient in chaotic</font>

1019
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:09,680

1022
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,450
are pretty independent of arrival order

00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:22,490
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1024
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:26,058
apply all these characteristics to mesh

1025
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:29,629
networks in two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop and</font>

1026
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:35,299
multipath we will explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that next</font>

1027
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:37,040
please so first thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop a</font>

1028
00:49:35,299 --> 00:49:43,640
typical problem if you have multiple

1029
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:46,759
offices these these numbers show the

1030
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:51,950
probability of the packet received from

1031
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:55,309
A to<font color="#E5E5E5"> B or HTC or hid and on each link</font>

1032
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:57,290
you might lose the packet and if if you

1033
00:49:55,309 --> 00:50:01,490
lose it the original sender has to send

1034
00:49:57,290 --> 00:50:05,660
it again so it the probability

1035
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:07,700
multiplies next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please and with</font>

1036
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:11,270
recoding we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

1037
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:13,930
because we can recover part of

1038
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:18,619
information from the intermediate hops

1039
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:22,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so the probability rises to</font>

1040
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:26,770
them to the probability of a weakest

1041
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:26,770
chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font>

1042
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:31,810
we have a feature which we have is but

1043
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:34,299
excuse me yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Julius chroma-trak could</font>

1044
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:36,099
you come to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous I don't</font>

1045
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,589
understand your figures on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font>

1046
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:42,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">side you're assuming no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AR Q here yes</font>

1047
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:44,859
this is assuming no irq so how does a RQ

1048
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,930
so assuming a RQ you would get widely

1049
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:49,140
different figures yes it would it would

1050
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:52,060
look very different I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1051
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:54,670
exact numbers in mind so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iook you it's</font>

1052
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:57,730
much better obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> but with network</font>

1053
00:50:54,670 --> 00:51:00,460
coding<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it would still be a little</font>

1054
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:02,740
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and recording is especially</font>

1055
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:08,339
interesting if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple paths</font>

1056
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:11,319
which we will come to in a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1057
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:13,569
so first thing you said recording to

1058
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:15,880
leverage for broadcast medium we don't

1059
00:51:13,569 --> 00:51:19,390
just think in one single path we think

1060
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,849
in corridors so there might be some

1061
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:26,589
links which are met requires very

1062
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:29,890
similar to the to the best path and we

1063
00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:33,310
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of every transmission as a custom</font>

1064
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:37,420
multicast we decide which nodes of the

1065
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:39,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">way should take part of that way based</font>

1066
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:41,200
on on some metrics we go don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> go into</font>

1067
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:46,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">detail but it could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> airtime for</font>

1068
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:49,750
example and different relays will hear

1069
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:53,200
different packets so we also made some

1070
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:54,819
experiments that we saw but yeah they

1071
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,040
just get different packets and some of

1072
00:51:54,819 --> 00:52:02,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">them are loss and these are not really</font>

1073
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:04,569
correlated ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> next please so and another</font>

1074
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing what we can do to leverage the</font>

1075
00:52:04,569 --> 00:52:10,150
network coding characteristics is but

1076
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:12,970
Rico does<font color="#E5E5E5"> only send out packets when</font>

1077
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:14,770
they're ranked increases the rank is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1078
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:16,629
number of linear independent<font color="#CCCCCC"> packet so</font>

1079
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:19,210
figure of it is you only send out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1080
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:21,130
packet if you get new information if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1081
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,839
get the same information which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> linear</font>

1082
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:25,920
dependent to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> packet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you already have</font>

1083
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:29,078
you then don't send anything and the

1084
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,630
funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about that is but you can</font>

1085
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:33,220
implicitly avoid writing groups you

1086
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:35,319
don't send anything which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

1087
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:38,410
known which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting also</font>

1088
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the first as a math talk which we</font>

1089
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:49,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard today</font>

1090
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:49,070
yeah next slide please so for multi path

1091
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:56,670
so if let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the link fails</font>

1092
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:59,370
immediately or fastly we don't have to

1093
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:02,930
wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the periodic updates we can</font>

1094
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:06,330
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the other our paths which</font>

1095
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:09,500
which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set up to forward for</font>

1096
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:13,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that specific multicast transmission and</font>

1097
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:15,690
we we will have feedback which tells us

1098
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send me some more</font>

1099
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:21,960
information packet and this will control

1100
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:25,350
how many which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rico to sense how many</font>

1101
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:27,720
packets we can also specify the size of

1102
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:30,839
the corridor<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we make a call it a</font>

1103
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:33,480
very narrow we will be at the unicast

1104
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:36,470
case which we already know we can also

1105
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:42,170
make very wide to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> more resilient</font>

1106
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright next we did some pretty yeah</font>

1107
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:46,860
some experiment we are also in the

1108
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,770
process of implementing all of that

1109
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:52,980
ideas and see how it works this is our

1110
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:55,350
our chair<font color="#E5E5E5"> and listen and we just had the</font>

1111
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,210
source destination and to realize we

1112
00:53:55,350 --> 00:54:02,640
were comparing with a battement protocol

1113
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:04,980
and visa had very bad links and we were

1114
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:12,690
comparing UDP as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember and</font>

1115
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:15,020
you see with just using the second relay

1116
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives some little bit of improvement</font>

1117
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:22,830
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> recording on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first relay give</font>

1118
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:25,640
some improvement and using both relays

1119
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:28,140
at the same time even gives more

1120
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:32,580
improvement yes Julia scrubber check

1121
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:35,250
Batman is doing a RQ shearing I think we

1122
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:37,140
were configuring as multicast but I have

1123
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:39,780
to a check I didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and do you</font>

1124
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:43,620
then do you remember roughly the packet

1125
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:46,680
loss rate you had on this was it 0.2 or

1126
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:48,930
was zero point 99 I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1127
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:52,589
were using one megabit per second it was

1128
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:54,859
already bad but I can't recall<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact</font>

1129
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,860
numbers

1130
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:02,160
but it's just a simple scenario also to

1131
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,770
give an idea what we want to do so Rick

1132
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,299
Taylor sorry I for this test that is a

1133

single stream going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from source to</font>

yesterday sorry follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> because i'll let</font>

1138
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:29,510
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish and then i'll ask questions</font>

1139
00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:32,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so that's yeah so to summarize we</font>

1140
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:35,130
what we think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to exploit</font>

00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:38,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadcast nature of a wireless</font>

1142
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:41,520
medium we can improve error resilience

1143
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:43,920
and possibly improve network throughput

1144
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,000
as well maybe not if everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on</font>

1145
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,569
the same channel but if we have

1146
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:52,020
distributed channels for example we also

1147
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:53,579
eliminate the need for xsplit explicit

1148
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:58,020
scheduling and pathfinding which we

1149
00:55:53,579 --> 00:56:01,859
would normally have to do if we do yeah

1150
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:03,630
multipath routing we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently in an</font>

1151
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:05,930
evaluation phase so as I said there's

1152
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:10,980
not really something written down we are

1153
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:15,690
doing code we have routers scattered and

1154
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:18,720
we are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right next so that's</font>

1155
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it again I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear your</font>

1156
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:31,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">feedback now or later and see how we can</font>

1157
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:34,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">work with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this group and Schwartz jigsaw</font>

1158
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:37,260
I've noticed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of mesh routing</font>

1159
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:40,140
systems seem to work very nicely<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1160
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:43,410
sparse message meshes where each node

1161
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:46,470
can see a few other nodes and collapse

1162
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:48,930
completely under radical congestion in

1163
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:50,759
ultra dense environments with you know

1164
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:53,210
like this room if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all had a mesh node</font>

1165
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:56,430
in our seat and we had total visibility

1166
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:57,900
you get these for example situations

1167
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:59,848
where somebody emits something and

1168
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,380
everybody else tries to echo it

1169
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:04,890
simultaneously on the same wireless

1170
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:06,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel so how how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does your system fair</font>

1171
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:11,109
in dense noted

1172
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:13,210
and so we didn't implement that but for

1173
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:18,010
the standard metric which we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1174
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:20,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of and you have a the source and</font>

1175
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:22,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination of in the same room we would</font>

1176
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:25,720
say ok the the metric to the destination

1177
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:28,960
directory is lower compared to going to

1178
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:31,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">another recoder and we would make the</font>

1179
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:35,680
corridor as narrowed to go to the

1180
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:42,070
receiver directly how would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1181
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:47,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so for example we we can find out</font>

1182
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:49,300
the the metrics like hop<font color="#E5E5E5"> counters for</font>

1183
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:53,140
simplest one but we think about airtime

1184
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:57,670
like like what kind of modulation rates

1185
00:57:53,140 --> 00:58:01,480
do we currently use and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is given</font>

1186
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:03,100
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> former selection algorithm</font>

1187
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,020
which are usually implemented in the

1188
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:06,880
wireless driver like can I reach that

1189
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:11,680
neighbor with one megabit per second of

1190
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:14,050
maybe 50 for makeup per second I'm John

1191
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">daddle and thanks for your presentation</font>

1192
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,780
really interesting can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to</font>

1193
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the slide where you were what are the</font>

1194
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:25,660
slides early on where you were striping

1195
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:27,760
the data across the outgoing packets one

1196
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:32,830
before I think that's up on there yeah

1197
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:36,310
so are you putting and data from one

1198
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:39,400
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your x y&z in more than</font>

1199
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:43,860
one packet that's going out between<font color="#CCCCCC"> SNR</font>

1200
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:47,010
yes so I am we are packing all the data

1201
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:49,780
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are multiplying that with</font>

1202
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:52,680
coefficients and putting the information

1203
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:56,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">from multiple packets into one packet</font>

1204
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:58,870
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so so what I'm getting at is is</font>

1205
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:01,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X Files I'd only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sent once</font>

1206
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:04,330
across the link a store or is it sent

1207
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:06,400
multiple times there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1208
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:09,400
combinations than multiple times so if

1209
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,830
you just send one packet with you can't

1210
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,300
compress free packets into one picot

1211
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:14,950
right right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now what I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned about</font>

1212
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,620
if you lose a package through nessuno

1213
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:19,430
you've lost several x y&z zat the other

1214
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:23,520
end

1215
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:25,140
no okay yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's oh yeah so it's all</font>

1216
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:32,070
mixed up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's question of whether</font>

1217
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:34,049
that's recoverable or not yeah yeah yeah

1218
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:35,910
it's it's it's coding so we can recover

1219
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:37,800
the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet through coding but</font>

1220
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:39,598
that's the idea where's also extensive

1221
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,270
literature we are thinking about

1222
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:47,060
employing random linear network coding

1223
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:54,000
if you want to look right<font color="#E5E5E5"> up right okay</font>

1224
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:57,930
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Judah scrub attract the critical and</font>

1225
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,780
it's really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the bit that is not</font>

1226
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:04,348
entirely clear to me or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually</font>

1227
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:07,109
hacking at the mac layer are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

1228
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:10,530
the 802<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot11</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mac or did you actually</font>

1229
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:14,549
implement your own mac layer that

1230
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:17,700
implements network coding so we are

1231
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:20,640
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> 802 11 but we are modifying the</font>

1232
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:24,750
drivers for example to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to send</font>

1233
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:28,500
packets and any modulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate what we</font>

1234
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:30,660
want or we turning off the AF q so we

1235
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,650
did some modifications but but we are

1236
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:36,930
using the 802 11 max azria chip is still

1237
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:41,400
running its original form or yes sure

1238
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:47,310
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you thank you for the</font>

1239
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:48,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">presentation um Justin Dean I'm working</font>

1240
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,630
group chair but I'm participating now as

1241
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:57,240
a participant I think it's really

1242
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting work I see this type of work</font>

1243
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:03,359
becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're doing in the future</font>

1244
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:05,400
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> glad you're at the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1245
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,650
glad some people from Batman or finally

1246
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:11,510
at the IDF I've been trying for a while

1247
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:13,470
to get you guys to come so that's nice

1248
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:18,050
the piece that I find really interesting

1249
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:20,368
is how this works with what we're

1250
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:23,190
scheduled to do right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now which is a fib</font>

1251
01:01:20,369 --> 01:01:25,200
and if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> interfaces at all or if we</font>

1252
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:29,099
should design certain features into a

1253
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:31,410
fib that would that this would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

1254
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:34,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take advantage of or not</font>

1255
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:37,078
so you mean how to split but in my mind

1256
01:01:34,049 --> 01:01:41,339
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the one that came to me was I had</font>

1257
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:44,010
listed you know for drop q hybrid well

1258
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:48,690
this is another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is encode yeah</font>

1259
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:51,210
shuffle it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another thing to do that we</font>

1260
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:54,240
hadn't thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of so okay yeah I'm me</font>

1261
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:56,369
interesting to consider but thank you

1262
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,589
would would<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely be good but I'm I</font>

1263
01:01:56,369 --> 01:02:01,950
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really follow the IDF process so</font>

1264
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:05,880
far<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm not sure I would be happy to</font>

1265
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:08,848
integrate that as well hello John<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trebek</font>

1266
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:11,160
I was wondering does this involve<font color="#E5E5E5"> metro</font>

1267
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:12,569
propagation like link state or distance

1268
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,118
<font color="#CCCCCC">vectors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work without that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font>

1269
01:02:12,569 --> 01:02:17,009
quick at different presentation yes as a

1270
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">Batman guy was thinking about distance</font>

1271
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:22,319
vector and propagation to propagate the

1272
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:23,730
metric and because we will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

1273
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,680
metric to define these corridors

1274
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:28,230
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it still has</font>

1275
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,419
propagation like other mesh routing

1276
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:33,750
protocols but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just a better</font>

1277
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:35,609
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send the data right right so so</font>

1278
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,500
we are thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about implementing a</font>

1279
01:02:35,609 --> 01:02:40,619
proactive protocol which is out of them

1280
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:45,359
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a baby or also all this</font>

1281
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:47,190
out and yeah then we have beacons which

1282
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:51,538
are flooded and propagating the metric

1283
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:55,500
and then we can make up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for past Rick</font>

1284
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:57,690
Tyler again um do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any any data</font>

1285
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,849
on I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coding</font>

1286
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:02,250
you add overhead in order to to add the

1287
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:05,460
redundancy within the mathematics get up

1288
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:08,760
to get the error correction in there but

1289
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:10,349
by doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you overcome the failures</font>

1290
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:14,730
due to dropped packets across the

1291
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:17,400
network for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a I don't know a hundred</font>

1292
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:18,960
kilobits<font color="#CCCCCC"> input stream how much do you</font>

1293
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:21,450
multiply out the packet and how does

1294
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,460
that offset against the chance of

1295
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:26,578
dropping so what rate do you get at the

1296
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:28,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">far end for your 100 kilobits in I kind</font>

1297
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:31,950
I'd love to see a graph of or<font color="#CCCCCC"> when if we</font>

1298
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:34,680
use very heavy error correction coding

1299
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:36,328
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing massive increase in in</font>

1300
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">packet size in order to get all that</font>

1301
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:41,279
redundancy in there now we don't drop

1302
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,230
any packets at all I would drop and that

1303
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:45,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">gets to the far end but it comes at a 10</font>

1304
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:48,660
times cost as compared to

1305
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:50,009
very little networking coding but guess

1306
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we actually lose some data along</font>

1307
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:54,540
the way that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interesting</font>

1308
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:56,910
graph as far as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> he yes so we should</font>

1309
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:59,550
probably have something later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but</font>

1310
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:01,710
basically but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ireland see is a write</font>

1311
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:04,260
less code so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easily say okay we</font>

1312
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:08,280
won a hundred percent of twelve percent

1313
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:10,440
redundancy by default we were or in the

1314
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:13,110
best case we can just send as many input

1315
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">pack packets as output packets just hold</font>

1316
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it right and if all of them are received</font>

1317
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:19,439
when it can be decoded and the only

1318
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,330
overhead you will have is the coding

1319
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,450
vector which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> attached in the</font>

1320
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:28,020
beginning um but you lose the redundancy

1321
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:33,839
by doing that so yes and and we would we

1322
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:36,360
would decide on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many extra redundant</font>

1323
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:39,090
packet we<font color="#E5E5E5"> send dynamically which would</font>

1324
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:40,530
also be part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the feedback and this so</font>

1325
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:42,360
you'd run that across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control plane</font>

1326
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:44,400
is your sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> distance vector here is</font>

1327
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,710
my metric propagation happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1328
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,720
think we should produce yeah but that

1329
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes a little bit into detail but for</font>

1330
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:54,330
example of rate control algorithm from

1331
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:57,210
Wi-Fi driver also tells us what is the

1332
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:59,100
drop probability and we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1333
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:00,420
into account we can also say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

1334
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:03,240
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or three neighbors where we</font>

1335
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:05,340
sent some I will tell my<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbors</font>

1336
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,500
through feedback hey I have let's say

1337
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:11,070
nine packets and each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should send</font>

1338
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:12,390
free of them recode for example I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1339
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:15,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting stuff and</font>

1340
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:17,580
with my dear let authors hat on can you

1341
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:19,230
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the Wi-Fi driver and</font>

1342
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,759
maybe look at using<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal app and then</font>

1343
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:23,880
it's portable two lots a lot of

1344
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">different radio systems lemon yeah but</font>

1345
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,200
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> your goods we've almost</font>

1346
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:36,250
got it published<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I will look</font>

1347
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:42,500
into that thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thank you okay</font>

1348
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:45,530
this hi I'm neither you are on without

1349
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:49,250
latency how is latency affected in in

1350
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:53,030
this small test ah that's that's a good

1351
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:55,100
question so usually if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

1352
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:56,630
coding in a blocked scheme you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1353
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,549
wait for let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten input packets</font>

1354
01:05:56,630 --> 01:06:01,130
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can start coding them and</font>

1355
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:03,350
sending them out there but there are

1356
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:05,390
also other approaches where you for

1357
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:08,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">example send the packet as is</font>

1358
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:09,710
immediately and just said redundant

1359
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:12,350
packets at the end that's called

1360
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:14,840
systematic coding in that case if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1361
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:18,080
actually receive the packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can</font>

1362
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,310
push<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up immediately and only if you</font>

1363
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:26,360
didn't receive and you have to wait for

1364
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:30,080
redundant redundant packet I am I'm Jim

1365
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:32,240
we um I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wondering if you have you</font>

1366
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,369
testing a larger scales maybe like 20

1367
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:37,040
note or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know 15 or something</font>

1368
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:39,950
like that as for things and and applies

1369
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:44,240
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money catalytically</font>

1370
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:47,390
mobility deeper option<font color="#E5E5E5"> a delay packet</font>

1371
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:51,129
loss and also latency as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1372
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:53,960
short answers no and no we have

1373
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:55,340
implemented or tested it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> for node</font>

1374
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,470
networks we also in the middle of

1375
01:06:55,340 --> 01:07:00,350
simulating and if if all that goes well

1376
01:06:57,470 --> 01:07:02,959
we will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a 50 200 notes to</font>

1377
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:04,720
make a bigger set up just in the

1378
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:09,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">University at that point it will be</font>

1379
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:11,450
static and we have some ideas to also

1380
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:15,770
test a little bit with drones and stuff

1381
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:19,270
like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not yeah we didn't</font>

1382
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:19,270
put too much thought into that yet

1383
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:33,929
okay thank you that was our last

1384
01:07:30,659 --> 01:07:35,489
presentation so we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick open</font>

1385
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:38,189
mic if anyone has any comments or

1386
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:39,779
questions regarding manet other than

1387
01:07:38,189 --> 01:07:43,919
what we've talked about or what we've

1388
01:07:39,779 --> 01:07:47,399
talked about now I'd be the time Julia

1389
01:07:43,919 --> 01:07:50,519
scrubber<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trek and I wish to apologize</font>

1390
01:07:47,399 --> 01:07:53,098
for two things one is that I didn't read

1391
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:54,658
the two management drafts and the other

1392
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:56,639
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm going to repeat</font>

1393
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:58,769
something that I've repeatedly said on

1394
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:01,109
the mailing list and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will keep</font>

1395
01:07:58,769 --> 01:08:03,238
repeating until the chairs called the

1396
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:08,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">security call security and get me kicked</font>

1397
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:10,469
out there is some really remarkable work

1398
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:14,219
that is being done in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole network</font>

1399
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:17,118
and group on autonomous management of

1400
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:21,179
networks I've given a talk on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font>

1401
01:08:17,118 --> 01:08:23,488
Monday it was we in Paris have been

1402
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:27,269
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to experiment with the hell net</font>

1403
01:08:23,488 --> 01:08:30,238
technologies in a mesh environment it

1404
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:32,579
works surprisingly well it needs some

1405
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:36,138
work I think it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great pity</font>

1406
01:08:32,578 --> 01:08:38,818
and a great wasted opportunity if the

1407
01:08:36,139 --> 01:08:40,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">management work for many was done in</font>

1408
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:44,069
isolation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work that has been done</font>

1409
01:08:40,948 --> 01:08:47,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole net what I'm hoping for is a man a</font>

1410
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:48,779
configured management protocol that

1411
01:08:47,038 --> 01:08:51,929
interoperates with the whole net stuff

1412
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:54,059
in some weaker sense not full

1413
01:08:51,929 --> 01:08:57,328
interoperability what exactly can be

1414
01:08:54,059 --> 01:08:59,190
achieved is not yet clear to us we've

1415
01:08:57,328 --> 01:09:03,929
been discussing that with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shannon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> raga</font>

1416
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:05,578
and Martin and Marcus Steinberg and well

1417
01:09:03,929 --> 01:09:07,158
I will keep working on that and i will

1418
01:09:05,578 --> 01:09:10,380
keep repeating that at every opportunity

1419
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:13,170
and and and i would say that sounds like

1420
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:15,239
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> i absolutely agree with you that the</font>

1421
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:16,589
work should not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in isolation it</font>

1422
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:20,308
should be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in conjunction with on</font>

1423
01:09:16,589 --> 01:09:22,229
that be we're looking as the IETF always

1424
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:25,980

1432
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:45,790
pieces there about auto configuration of

1433
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:47,690
addresses and how it was working so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:51,429
interested to talk with you after this

01:09:51,429 --> 01:09:56,929
Jehovah armistice there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1437
01:09:54,229 --> 01:09:58,730
research work going this direction for

1438
01:09:56,929 --> 01:10:01,940
mobile networks to consider the position

1439
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:04,419
of the nodes in order to anticipate the

1440
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:07,428
routing the connections between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nose</font>

1441
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:10,219
has this been already been considered or

1442
01:10:07,429 --> 01:10:13,250
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something interesting I've</font>

1443
01:10:10,219 --> 01:10:16,580
had talks with with authors of all srb2

1444
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:18,050
in the past regarding position I think

1445
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:20,870
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we would be open to</font>

1446
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:23,570
considering the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comes</font>

1447
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:26,570
to my mind is how you can augment hola

1448
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:29,389
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> too with position information put</font>

1449
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:30,530
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> TL vs attached to addresses that</font>

1450
01:10:29,389 --> 01:10:31,790
seems like it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be relatively</font>

1451
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:34,309
straightforward and then you could

1452
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:37,040
select<font color="#E5E5E5"> mprs or next hop neighbors based</font>

1453
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:38,690
upon it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be interesting work I</font>

1454
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,040
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a whole new</font>

1455
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:41,870
protocol I think I think we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1456
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:44,840
pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can we can build on what</font>

1457
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:46,010
we have and also allow it to be used by

1458
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:49,190
other protocols that might come along

1459
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">later so yes please please write to list</font>

1461
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:57,409
many architecture and what we have right

share our work in for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group</font>

1471
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:25,400
in order to standardize something like

1472
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:27,080
that no that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that would be</font>
