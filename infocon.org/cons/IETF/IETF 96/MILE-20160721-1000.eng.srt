00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,700
what was the substance of those changes

82
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,820

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,039
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we got together bonus eros</font>

84
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,230
we've had eight revisions and that was

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,810
to address working group last call ad

86
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:33,040

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,240
slide so talking through what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font>

89
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,680
in those eight revisions so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

90
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,110
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to point out is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font>

91
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">great set of great set of slides this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

92
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">something we've been doing for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

93
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,760
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years to point out that</font>

94
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are no new incompatibilities</font>

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,620
introduced with those recent revisions

96
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,969
so that in compatibility list is what it

97
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,340
was last time we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

98
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,830
there's an actual obviously a section in

99
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,969
the draft that talks about what that

100
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,150
phone is through with some additional

101
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,760
explanation next slide so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

102
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,469
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to point out is that in</font>

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exhibit and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is more kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

104
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,860
what is the relationship of this

105
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,410
document you other documents first and

106
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,330
foremost we're deprecating<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50-70 that</font>

107
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,710
was previously in the in the document

108
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,520
what was not in the document was

109
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:22,780
deprecating 6685 so that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

110
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:26,049
and a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> edition pulling from 6685 is</font>

111
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,940
that there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> now be expert review for</font>

112
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,160
any namespace registered with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ayanna</font>

113
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,900
that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> io death in it and the thinking</font>

114
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is if you have i oh def in your</font>

115
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,799
namespace you're probably an extension

116
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,700
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be we want to have some</font>

117
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,350
review about

118
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,729
out you know what extensions might look

119
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,770
like just to make sure that they're

120
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,830
appropriate to be called iof so that's

121
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,010
now in the draft there's some guidance

122
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,840
now about weakening frankly how rigorous

123
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,710
the parsing needs to be so two key

124
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,469
changes were actually in 5071 had to

125
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,109
reject syntax errors now now the

126
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,690
recommendation is just should<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were</font>

127
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,700
significant concern about<font color="#CCCCCC"> dossing iono</font>

128
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,010
and doing the download of all those

129
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,349
various numerator tables that that make

130
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,330
those attributes extensible so now

131
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,500
there's there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> language that you know</font>

132
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,050
says that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be done</font>

133
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,570
periodically and there's reinforcement

134
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,190
to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in no new world should</font>

135
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,310
you dynamically building those schemas

136
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,440
from from those enumerated tables so

137
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,260
some stronger language around the must

138
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,990
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ship's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide please the</font>

139
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,550
security considerations was completely

140
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,340
was complete scrubbed a lot of new

141
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,010
things added a new section on privacy

142
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,340
implications pointing out in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

143
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,080
detail where executable content might be

144
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,179
there is a lot more language related to

145
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adam and negotiation what fields need to</font>

146
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,660
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered in that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

147
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,270
big discussion that came out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> IU's do</font>

148
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">you review about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much confidence you</font>

149
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,599
should have in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidence values</font>

150
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,430
that are conveyed and so there's a bit

151
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,500
more language effectively saying be

152
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,000
careful confidence probably doesn't mean

153
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,260
what you think it is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,790
when you get data you're going to have

155
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,530
to rethink what it is don't trust the

156
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,690
people that then<font color="#E5E5E5"> set set you that data</font>

157
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,510
so that got put in there next slide

158
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">please there were a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of new things</font>

159
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,110
actually added out right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font>

160
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,429
model rather rather than kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

161
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,660
interpretation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was already there</font>

162
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:18,550
so in the 05 of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IO def guidance a</font>

163
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,590
couple of errors were pointed out and so

164
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,080
that resulted in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few new attributes</font>

165
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,890
and classes getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in as part of</font>

166
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,810
the privacy review there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to new</font>

167
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,110
things added for addresses so now

168
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:35,110
there's the ability to convey masked

169
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,550
privacy mast ipv4 and ipv6 addresses so

170
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,409
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily have to give a</font>

171
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,319
full<font color="#E5E5E5"> address kind of anymore or full</font>

172
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,290
block or prefix you can mask addresses

173
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,660
out with X's and then back to this idea

174
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,939
of your more refinement in how you

175
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,290
convey confidence and things net with

176
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,000
indicators now it

177
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,849
possible to you in a very granular way

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,500
when you compose you know IP address

179
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,500
with a domain name or other indicators

180
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,120
together you can add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tapper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blah basis</font>

181
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
in an indicator actually convey

182
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,850
confidence so you can say I have

183
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">confidence in this first part of the</font>

184
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:10,000
indicator but not in the second part so

185
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:12,610
next slide please so that takes us to

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,199
the end I think primarily if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

187
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,850
questions about what got done I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

188
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:17,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">can clarify them here I think given</font>

189
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,209
where we are I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there should</font>

190
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:21,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of discussion because we</font>

191
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:24,819
probably can't change so much right now

192
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:26,500
so any clarifying questions about about

193
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:35,050
any of the revisions that got done since

194
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:36,759
last time we got together thank you very

195
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:42,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">much for the work I have one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

196
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:44,980
look it's about iono you said implement

197
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,040
to have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change a check to update with</font>

198
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:51,130
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> schemer free from time to time that</font>

199
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,529
means when we add new value to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zion on</font>

200
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,860
table the person who registers about you

201
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,779
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update the schemer is it correct</font>

202
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,810
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the language was previously</font>

203
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:04,930
written it would imply<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as an IO</font>

204
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:07,300
Jeff parser you need to be regularly

205
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,099
checking the eye and a schema in not

206
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,510
quite a real-time fashion but something

207
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,130
close to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and dynamically building</font>

208
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,990
that schema all the time what the

209
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,110
language now says is something on the

210
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:20,709
order of hey vendors make<font color="#CCCCCC"> iof parsers</font>

211
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,000
when you release new builds of your of

212
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:24,160
your partial you should get the new

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,240
values for my Anna and that may<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

214
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,250
that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to change your</font>

215
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,050
parson luggage logic so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very</font>

216
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific about how often you do it but</font>

217
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:37,300
it's more cautionary don't do it often

218
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:43,120
and don't knock over<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i doing it are</font>

219
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:45,180
there other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you thank</font>

220
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,180
you

221
00:10:46,580 --> 00:11:00,180
so next agenda is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> roni draft so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave</font>

222
00:10:50,460 --> 00:11:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">detective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay please good morning so</font>

223
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,250
today I'm going to talk briefly about

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,590
some of the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been doing</font>

225
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:14,640
on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roli I've got a handful of issues</font>

226
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:17,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk through but before I do that I</font>

227
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,130
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a brief conceptual</font>

228
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:24,860
overview of what we've been working on

229
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:27,240
with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolling next slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please so</font>

230
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,790
Rowley is the resource<font color="#E5E5E5"> oriented</font>

231
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:34,170
lightweight information exchange I got

232
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:37,550
up that<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide it's effectively a profile</font>

233
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:40,860
of both the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam publication protocol</font>

234
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:42,810
and the atom syndication format so the

235
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,700
publication protocol defines a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest</font>

236
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">based approach for retrieving</font>

237
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,830
information resources and the atom

238
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,069
syndication format describes a number of

239
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:55,200
document formats that can be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

240
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,720
describe<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like the available</font>

241
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,970
resource collections and an individual

242
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,740
resource collection or an individual

243
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:07,680
resource that's available within a

244
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:09,600
repository so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam pub Rowley</font>

245
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,140
allows collections of security

246
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:18,150
information resources to be published

247
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:21,810
and discovered by users without having

248
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:24,560
prior information about the information

249
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:29,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's published to a given repository</font>

250
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:33,300
soil allows dynamic discovery of content

251
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,980
it provides a mechanism to characterize

252
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,660
different types of security information

253
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,640
resources using media types but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

254
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,439
also added some other characterization

255
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,370
capabilities which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be talking about</font>

256
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,920
shortly it creates a<font color="#CCCCCC"> system that allows</font>

257
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:53,250
publishers to push their content to a

258
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,920
repository and they can do so by

259
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,050
providing granular access controls as to

260
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,439
who can publish and who can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see</font>

261
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,780
the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's published</font>

262
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,480
the draft as it currently stands has

263
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,579
been generalized to support more general

264
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,120
security information exchange it was

265
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:15,420
originally targeted specifically to<font color="#CCCCCC"> IO</font>

266
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,980
def exchanges we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working to</font>

267
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,630
actually open the draft to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

268
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,160
support some additional kinds of

269
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,900
information exchanges the idea is that

270
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">consumers of C certain information might</font>

271
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,920
also need to retrieve other kinds of

272
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">information like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information about</font>

273
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,400
vulnerabilities and and other kinds of

274
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">things there's a lot of overlap between</font>

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're trying to do here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in mile and</font>

276
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,540
what we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do in sac I'm</font>

277
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,610
relating the similar kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

278
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,920
information so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

279
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:50,190
generalize the draft in a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

280
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,329
same transport can basically be used to

281
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:57,240
satisfy<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm general information needs</font>

284
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:06,930
something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a service document</font>

285
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:10,199
which is a type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Adam pub document the</font>

286
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,359
service document describes a number of

287
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,540
work spaces which are logical

288
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,120
collections of resource collections and

289
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:22,010
has a collection element which defines

290
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:25,710
in a specific resource collection in

291
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,540
this case we have a resource collection

292
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,330
which provides public incident

293
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:33,599
information relating<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the organization</font>

294
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:36,240
that's providing it we've added this new

295
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adam category type which is information</font>

296
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,830
type which defines the type of

297
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,660
information as being<font color="#CCCCCC"> incident so this is</font>

298
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,400
an extension point that we've defined in

299
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,290
the new Rollie draft which basically

300
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,949
allows you to characterize the type of

301
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,839
information that's being provided in a

302
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,300
given resource collection the reason we

303
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,910
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam pub was</font>

304
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,609
originally developed largely for

305
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:05,850
blogging kinds of applications so there

306
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:08,490
was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was implied that you were</font>

307
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,040
basically providing you know blog kind

308
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,059
of information so we needed some way of

309
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,009
actually describing in a more rich way

310
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,899
a the types of security automation

311
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:19,769
information that was being provided by

312
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:23,079
the repository so that's what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam</font>

313
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:26,289
category element is being used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for in</font>

314
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:31,478
part in the current role a draft next

315
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:36,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

316
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:40,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">rolly feed so every document type in</font>

317
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:42,399
enrollee has an ID this feed has an ID

318
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:45,909
element that uniquely identifies the

319
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,089
feed it duplicates the the category

320
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:50,799
element because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a client may</font>

321
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,299
actually just be seeing the feed for the

322
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:53,829
first time instead of the service

323
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:56,228
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really depends on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

324
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:59,618
they're discovering the repository

325
00:15:56,229 --> 00:16:02,949
meaning every every document<font color="#CCCCCC"> and an atom</font>

326
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:06,449
pub and rowley<font color="#E5E5E5"> is effectively an HTTP</font>

327
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:09,488
resource so links can be passed around

328
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:12,218
to various consumers so they can be

329
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:13,749
accessing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolly repository directly</font>

330
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:15,909
through the service document where they

331
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:18,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovered it initially or they could be</font>

332
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:22,149
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a link that someone sent to a</font>

333
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:24,339
feed so it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font>

334
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:28,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">category information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this metadata I'm</font>

335
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:30,009
in multiple places so another aspect of

336
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:33,699
the feed is it provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> an updated link</font>

337
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:35,589
or an updated time timestamp which

338
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:39,639
indicates the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time content was</font>

339
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:42,879
posted to the feed it it contains a

340
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:47,109
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> link relationships so Adam pub</font>

341
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:49,229
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a stateless protocol and it uses</font>

342
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:52,919
links essentially as a way of

343
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:57,699
identifying state transitions within

344
00:16:52,919 --> 00:17:00,519
within the repository so these links

345
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:03,819
provided information like you know what

346
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:06,549
URL you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> access this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the self</font>

347
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:08,949
rel would be what URL you would use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

348
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:12,368
access this feed which is probably the

349
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:15,789
one that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to retrieve it another</font>

350
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:17,529
the other link has a rel of service so

351
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:19,329
this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

352
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:22,509
use to<font color="#E5E5E5"> retrieve the service document</font>

353
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,849
that's associated with this feed the

354
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,400
link with rel search' as an example

355
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,469
points to a

356
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,070
an open search template that can be used

357
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:34,260
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> search the feed Kristin osseo</font>

358
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:37,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Carnegie Mellon saw I understand that</font>

359
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:42,540
this is just a mock-up in a unit but so

360
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:45,540
the the self link is is would<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

361
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:48,750
presumably have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information on it</font>

362
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:53,100
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this specific document so</font>

363
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:55,950
that's still restful or or how it or is

364
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that not in the self link what do you</font>

365
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,890
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the specific document well so</font>

366
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,870
right in restful every URL you can

367
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,390
reproduce the exact document every time

368
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're saying right and so I'm going to</font>

369
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,800
presume that just going to provider

370
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">incidents isn't going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

371
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,690
unique and then that makes me try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

372
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,700
understand what the updated tag is right

373
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,200
so technically you could version you

374
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,530
could create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new version of this fee</font>

375
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,800
by changing its content which would be a

376
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:28,620
new instance effectively of the feed so

377
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,240
the self link is intended to point to

378
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">the specific instance that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

379
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,130
provided at this point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so if you</font>

380
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,260
made a change you should be able to use

381
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,650
the self link on this record to get the

382
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:43,530
previous instance of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that that</font>

383
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,480
tea before the change so you're right

384
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:49,200
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do that this</font>

385
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,700
example is a simple mock-up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it</font>

386
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,560
doesn't it doesn't provide enough

387
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,150
distinguishing information to really

388
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:01,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">support that good point next slide</font>

389
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:04,500
please so there's an extension in

390
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:08,040
enrollee Aryan Adam pub that also allows

391
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,190
you to provide paged feeds so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

392
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,639
here is that you know feeds may have you

393
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,320
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundreds thousands of records which</font>

394
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:21,480
you know could be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data to</font>

395
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:26,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange generally rowley feeds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adam pub</font>

396
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,770
feeds are are ordered in the most recent

397
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:35,189
entries that have been posted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

398
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:37,860
feed appear first so using paging you

399
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,330
can effectively retrieve the first few

400
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,519
pages gets you know the most recent

401
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,428
information and then if you're

402
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,860
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in retrieving additional</font>

403
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:50,559
historical information from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> feed you</font>

404
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,809
could actually view multiple additional

405
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,539
pages so paging provides a way of

406
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:58,178
breaking up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a given</font>

407
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:01,269
feed over over a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

408
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:05,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">pages so we have some description on how</font>

409
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:07,510
to use paging from rolling this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a new</font>

410
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,668
a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been recently</font>

411
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft next slide</font>

412
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:14,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">please so this is what a rolling entry</font>

413
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:20,070
looks like so this would represent a

414
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:23,470
given a given resource an atom pub

415
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,899
there's a content element which can work

416
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,029
in two ways you can either directly

417
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:33,340
embed the content that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're</font>

418
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:36,330
referencing or you can provide a link to

419
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:40,178
where the content can can be retrieved

420
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,370
we've we've updated the draft to

421
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:46,330
actually recommend that the content be

422
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:48,489
provided based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a link because if</font>

423
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,820
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> large document models</font>

424
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:55,269
of content the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data that could</font>

425
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,730
be contained in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> content element which</font>

426
00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:02,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">is also then embedded in the feed could</font>

427
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:06,159
actually be quite voluminous so it's

428
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably more effective to provide a</font>

429
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,880
link to the content that way a client

430
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:12,130
can select the content that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

431
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,309
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and only download the</font>

432
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:20,679
content that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need so that's a new</font>

433
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:25,059
feature in in enrollee we've also added

434
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:28,269
an element called Rollie format to

435
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:31,029
describe the model that's being that the

436
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:32,590
content is represented within and we'll

437
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:35,139
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about that a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

438
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:38,678
in a few minutes and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why is</font>

439
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:40,719
because the mime type itself described

440
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,120
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the content element is often not</font>

441
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,059
descriptive enough to describe the

442
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,270
specific model that's being used for the

443
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:51,100
content so we believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed some</font>

444
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,740
mechanism by which we can provide more

445
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,189
metadata that way the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client that's</font>

446
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,809
retreat

447
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,720
this content would have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better sense</font>

448
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:02,049
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> format of the content before they</font>

449
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,820
actually retrieve the content next slide

450
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:09,309
please so I talked briefly about this

451
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,220
before so we built an extension system

452
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:14,350
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> rowley this is a new capability</font>

453
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,139
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current draft so we're</font>

454
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,059
effectively using an eye on a table to

455
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:22,029
allow registrations of different

456
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:24,960
information types to be made in the

457
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:29,710
initial<font color="#CCCCCC"> rowley core there are no</font>

458
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:32,409
information types defined our plan is to

459
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,659
write the series of use case drafts that

460
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:37,570
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe specific types of</font>

461
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:42,490
information which would then make the

462
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:44,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">the registrations with I Anna so the sea</font>

463
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:47,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">cert content that was originally in the</font>

464
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:49,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">rolly draft we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently working on a</font>

465
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,809
second draft that contains all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

466
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:56,019
original content and basically describes

467
00:22:52,809 --> 00:23:00,519
incident and indicator information type

468
00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:03,909
use cases for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ferroli so we're hoping to</font>

469
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:06,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have that that draft ready for the</font>

470
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:09,129
for the next meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were pretty</font>

471
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,019
close<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time but we hadn't finished</font>

472
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:13,360
working through the draft so it wasn't

473
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:16,059
entirely clear how it was being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used in</font>

474
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,758
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in the context of the updated core</font>

475
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:21,129
yet so we we didn't publish it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

476
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:24,269
meeting yet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's our first</font>

477
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:27,009
priority basically at this point in time

478
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:30,669
so effectively what this will allow us

479
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do is through a specification</font>

480
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:36,940
required registry allow new information

481
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,399
types to be created in rowley over over

482
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:44,860
time next slide please so now I wanted

483
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:47,620
to talk through a handful of issues the

484
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,959
issue numbers correspond to the the

485
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,489
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the github repository so if</font>

486
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,919
you want to read some additional detail

487
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:57,129
about these issues or comment on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

488
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,190
issues follow the github link that's in

489
00:23:57,129 --> 00:24:02,619
the at the top of the draft and and and

490
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:06,369
feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to comment on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those those</font>

491
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:07,810
issues there so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue we have</font>

492
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:11,500
is the

493
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:14,620
the previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowley draft included a</font>

494
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:18,280
section that talked about the forward

495
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:20,679
slash resource URL and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

496
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,690
designed to provide compatibility with a

497
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:29,920
rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint so the idea would be that</font>

498
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:34,150
if the organization or if the service

499
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:36,900
hosting a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly repository was was</font>

500
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,610
queried using the forward slash resource

501
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:43,300
that that would either redirect the user

502
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:46,870
to a rid service or it provides some

503
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:51,220
resource not available status code now

504
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:56,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very specific to you know to see</font>

505
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:59,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">cert and and and rid use cases we have a</font>

506
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:02,200
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of options the first would be to</font>

507
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,050
keep it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> core the problem</font>

508
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:08,080
with this option<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's it's not useful</font>

509
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:11,320
for non incident non I<font color="#CCCCCC"> o def use cases</font>

510
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,770
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roley which we expect there to be you</font>

511
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,000
know many of those kinds of use cases we

512
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,800
would effectively be requiring

513
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,470
additional implementation for all

514
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,810
rolling implementers even even if they

515
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:25,060
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not interested in you know</font>

516
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:27,850
providing capabilities for the you know

517
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:32,620
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident I o def kind of youth</font>

518
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:34,510
case the other option is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move this</font>

519
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,810
requirement to the sea<font color="#E5E5E5"> cert use case</font>

520
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:40,750
document so effectively if the

521
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:42,580
repository is implementing<font color="#CCCCCC"> rowley for</font>

522
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,380
the sea cert use case then this would be

523
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,480
an additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement that it would</font>

524
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:53,680
have to to implement this would

525
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,690
effectively allow implementations to be

526
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,950
constrained only if they're providing

527
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:02,040
incident data to support this this rid

528
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:06,010
compatibility case so I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

529
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:09,010
opinions on whether we should follow a

530
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:11,200
or b or maybe an another option room

531
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,550
engineer sir just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clarify i'm not</font>

532
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
going to say I'm smart kind of on the

533
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,470
issue but why couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we keep it in</font>

534
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,930
rowley core make it optional we could do

535
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,210
that so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

536
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:34,010
option

537
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:41,330
any other opinions see seems reasonable

538
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:44,450
to me do we want to do some kind of yeah

539
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:48,710
I guess you want to stick a consensus

540
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:50,210
call we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that um but so this is</font>

541
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,640
Nancy came when just as an individual

542
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:56,780
what's um Rowan what's the difference

543
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,990
between a and C cuz I thought seat was

544
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:01,490
also to keep an enrollee well yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was</font>

545
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:05,300
he keeping an enrollee but it would be

546
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:08,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">making it am a requirement right I I</font>

547
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,340
thought oh hey was it's a must in some I

548
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,650
gotta leave that<font color="#E5E5E5"> use case I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

549
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,659
write the code he was it's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in</font>

550
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,000
some document so like put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in yourself</font>

551
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,100
but I thought perhaps he might be it's

552
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,950
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basics back so it's enrollee core</font>

553
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,750
but it's a should not a must so if you

554
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,310
that functionality you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build in</font>

555
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,410
but if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know your</font>

556
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:31,340
protein so doesn't support versus last

557
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:34,670
yeah that's exactly right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay come on</font>

558
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:37,429
Phil serious um so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep it in core</font>

559
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:41,450
as optional then presumably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Caesar</font>

560
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:43,700
doc would make it a must for that use

561
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,950
case it could do that we could work that

562
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,450
out later yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I'm just trying</font>

563
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think down that path for a second</font>

564
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:56,980
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's do a hum I guess um</font>

565
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:07,670
yeah let's do a hum to see if the group

566
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:10,010
also agrees on option C which is keeping

567
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:14,150
it in core but as a should as opposed to

568
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:16,690
a must so those in favor of that can you

569
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,690
do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

570
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:33,450
yeah that's why I'm going this way<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

571
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:41,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">those not in favor please hum ok I think</font>

572
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:43,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">that makes it easy yeah so we'll look</font>

573
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:47,220
yeah I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask if there are any</font>

574
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:52,470
strong objections for us adopting this

575
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:56,850
option or any other opinions going once

576
00:28:52,470 --> 00:29:02,809
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> twice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I think we have</font>

577
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:02,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">guidance thank you next slide please</font>

578
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:09,330
this was that the actual text so the

579
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:17,908

581
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:23,809
another another issue so an atom you can

582
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,370
have service documents that describe the

583
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:28,500
available collections of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the repository</font>

584
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:31,559
you can each collection has an

00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Associated feed document which contains</font>

586
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:37,080
an enumeration of all of the entries of

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that feed I was showing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you the example</font>

588
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,240
earlier about having a self link for an

589
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,070
entry which you could actually then use

590
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">to point back to a document that</font>

591
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:52,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">describes the entry itself so an</font>

00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:57,240
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> two documents that it needs to</font>

594
00:29:54,510 --> 00:30:01,100
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support our service documents</font>

595
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:04,200
and feed documents an alternate

596
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:07,110
additional document type that a service

597
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,200
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide is an entry document so</font>

598
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a given entry it could</font>

599
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:18,990
provide a resolvable resource so we're

600
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,000
kind of at a crossroads this was

601
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:24,149
something that was somewhat undefined in

602
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,220
the previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowley draft as to whether</font>

603
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:28,469
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an expectation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

604
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,960
repositories would provide these entry

605
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:34,050
documents the you know resolvable link

606
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,420
for an entry our<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal</font>

607
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:39,270
is that we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support</font>

608
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">standalone entries because that would</font>

609
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,980
provide a mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> by which you know</font>

610
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:48,690
third parties could pass around links to

611
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:52,920
entry records which I think has some

612
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:55,230
some valuable use so this proposal would

613
00:30:52,920 --> 00:31:00,930
be to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pointer to the</font>

614
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:03,090
containing to support both the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entry</font>

615
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:07,410
link as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide a pointer to</font>

616
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:10,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> containing feed from the entry</font>

617
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:16,500
resource to point back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the collection</font>

618
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:19,429
that that the entry was was part of so

619
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:23,460
we would effectively update section 6.3

620
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:26,400
to add the collection relationship to

621
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,860
the available link relationships for an

622
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,630
entry and this would only be the case if

623
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:35,669
the entry is provided as a standalone

624
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:39,630
entry document not as part of a feed

625
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay an atom of iligan is there ever a</font>

626
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,100
case when you'd have to point back or

627
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,290
potentially point back to multiple

628
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,139
containing feeds yeah so you could

629
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:51,659
multiply instantiate link relation if

630
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:57,470
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case there's nothing that</font>

631
00:31:51,660 --> 00:32:03,780
prevents that our folks in favor of

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this any objections to making this</font>

634
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,720
isn't optional to put it in well we were

635
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,870
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it a requirement</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to provide a resource because I'm</font>

637
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,310
wondering if it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

638
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:22,470
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> anona you know share a document</font>

639
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:29,600
without necessarily pointing to the

640
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:31,549
repository came from I see

641
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,678
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should drive some discussion</font>

642
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:36,620
on this on the list because there's some

643
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,360
complications there I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think i would</font>

644
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,809
prefer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this to the list so we</font>

645
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:44,030
can have a deeper discussion about that

646
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:47,270
your your issues are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> github too right</font>

647
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:52,639
yes so we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> bought follow it through</font>

648
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:56,030
both gonna ban the list great uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

649
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so so now when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was showing you</font>

650
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:02,000
the examples of what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly entry would</font>

651
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:05,120
look like I shown an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

652
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,070
included the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly format element which</font>

653
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,809
incidentally we can also call the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolly</font>

654
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:13,460
data model elements if someone has a has

655
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:18,500
a preference we've been kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of debating</font>

656
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:20,270
which which name to call it but it but

657
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,789
effectively it would provide an

658
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:25,490
indicator of the format used to express

659
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:32,750
the the content that's being pointed to

660
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:33,890
by given atom content entry the idea

661
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,440
would be that it would provide some

662
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">additional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information about the format</font>

663
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,450
that that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used to include</font>

664
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:45,289
things like a namespace for the for the

665
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:48,260
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> model that is that it's it's</font>

666
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:51,460
described using maybe a version of that

667
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">data model if the data model has a</font>

668
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">associated version may be a resource</font>

669
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:01,600
identifier where you could find a

670
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,700
relative schema or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> data model</font>

671
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:10,239
definition that might be possible in

672
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:14,119
some fashion and perhaps some type of

673
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:18,469
schema type that would describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

674
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:21,139
format of the the schema document we're

675
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:24,770
all ideas that that we've been we've

676
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:28,669
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about unfortunately there</font>

677
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:31,449
are I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find my type for for</font>

678
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:35,089
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> individuals schema documents um</font>

679
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:37,600
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML schema suggests that you use</font>

680
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:40,070
the mime type of application XML which

681
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:43,129
doesn't differentiate a schema from any

682
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">other kind of XML documents um so that's</font>

683
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:45,918
not

684
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:48,169
terribly useful so in order for us to do

685
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,299
schema type who would probably have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

686
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,399
come up with some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of registry</font>

687
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:58,999
or find another kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of registry that</font>

688
00:34:52,399 --> 00:35:12,288
exists that does that for us can you go

689
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:13,970
back Nancy can one jet so um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

690
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:15,799
the points are<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-taken the only</font>

691
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,660
question I have is providing the

692
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:21,440
globally unique identifier it can be

693
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:25,430
hard so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to have to</font>

694
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,859
provide guidance as to how to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

695
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:30,499
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that identifier to ensure that</font>

696
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:33,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's global uniqueness and you need</font>

697
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:36,578
to define the scope of global right well

698
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,809
we have the ITF name xml namespace

699
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:42,289
registry but that doesn't help us for

700
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:48,769
other non<font color="#E5E5E5"> xml types yes we would have to</font>

701
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:50,930
figure that out so um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

702
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:53,538
thoughts on on some of these these

703
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:57,288
questions do we do we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the</font>

704
00:35:53,539 --> 00:36:00,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">extent of providing metadata about you</font>

705
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:01,789
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the format of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the content</font>

706
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:07,039
element do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that that's an</font>

707
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:09,559
important use case and are there

708
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,660
specific we're recommending a few

709
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,730
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> attributes here are there</font>

710
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:17,989
specific thoughts on on each of these

711
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:19,880
attributes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roman janu your cert I like</font>

712
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:21,739
the idea of supporting different types

713
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,809
of payloads and if we do that we're

714
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:26,470
gonna have to describe what those are so

715
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:29,779
sounds sounds like a good idea to me I

716
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:32,419
do we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go as far as defining you</font>

717
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:41,420
know schema and schema types as an as an

718
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:43,849
example any thoughts on that is there a

719
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:47,450
way not to do it cuz I think kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

720
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:49,700
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to well I mean the way not to do it</font>

721
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,859
is not to do it yeah then then it's just

722
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">a blob of information right and well you</font>

723
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:55,700
would like without it<font color="#CCCCCC"> without defining a</font>

724
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,240
schema you would still have notionally a

725
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:00,149
namespace which would define

726
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,220
some expectation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data model so i</font>

727
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:05,310
don't think a schema is explicitly

728
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:09,209
necessary if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to validate that</font>

729
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:10,920
that the information meets that data

730
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,260
model expectation then you would need

731
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,040
something like a schema or some data

732
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,810
definition expression for the cost of

733
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,630
adding like a schema pointer i would

734
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:25,350
think why would you not do it if you're

735
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:27,330
gonna do the rest so another way we

736
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,250
could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is if we and I have a</font>

737
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:31,529
follow-up issue on this if we require

738
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:34,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a given information type that</font>

739
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:36,170
you support specific kinds of

740
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,790
information formats we could actually

741
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:41,310
define in the specification or in an

742
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:43,440
iono registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the required schema</font>

743
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,720
you know must be and then we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

744
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily declare it here so that</font>

745
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:54,089
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are alternate ways of doing that I</font>

746
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:57,869
like I like this include all of them is

747
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:59,820
required if you do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them right if</font>

748
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:07,380
you put in an unknown one fill it all

749
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:10,320
out Roman dinnae do I tend to agree you

750
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,300
probably need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> specify both the</font>

751
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,760
encoding which would to me would be like

752
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">its schema to relax ng potentially</font>

753
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,410
something else a lot of those formats

754
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,359
you describe can embed in them then the

755
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,529
formatting of what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I'm envisioning</font>

756
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,359
and I don't know I can't give you an

757
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,220
example of maybe one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't have</font>

758
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,600
that and so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice to give</font>

759
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,419
additional guidance about how to parse

760
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,900
it so the encoding of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

761
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,420
content you know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like utf-8</font>

762
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,390
as an example wrong short-circuited oh

763
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:42,570
yes or a do i do you mean encoding as in

764
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:45,390
yet you tfn mean more like JSON or you

765
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:47,340
know maybe CSV and if I said CSV how do

766
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,350
I tell you which flavor you know how to

767
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,790
parse the individual fields and with XML

768
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,890
I can point to kind of something I'm

769
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,960
imagining a format that perhaps natively

770
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,580
I can't hurt you how to parse that and

771
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,350
you're giving me the flexibility to

772
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,090
convey all that sound I kind of like

773
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:03,210
you're suggesting the encoding of the

774
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:07,619
schema yeah that's right sorry encoding

775
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">over literature yeah this year I'll say</font>

776
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,970
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just right at the schema well just</font>

777
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:16,460
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> i/o def we're gonna have a</font>

778
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:18,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">XML and JSON right well no but what</font>

779
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,600
Romans talking about here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the</font>

780
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:22,910
serialization format of the content but

781
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> serialization of the data definition</font>

782
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:30,140
the schema exactly you can you can

783
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:32,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">already define the serialization method</font>

784
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,670
of the content using the content

785
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:38,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">elements and and the associated mind</font>

786
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:40,760
type for that so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to do</font>

787
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,050
that but for the schema we would need to

788
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide some mechanism to declare that</font>

789
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:50,180
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> great feedback so we were</font>

790
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:54,470
going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> namespace required and the</font>

791
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:59,540
rest optional is everyone okay with with

792
00:39:54,470 --> 00:40:02,990
that anyone concerns my suggestion<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

793
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:04,910
take it back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list okay and make</font>

794
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,979
sure be an agreement so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm presuming</font>

795
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:14,089
this issue is also on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the github it is</font>

796
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:17,810
issue number three great well uh issue

797
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:21,200
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> four schema for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly</font>

798
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:22,820
namespace so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this format</font>

799
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,830
element we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to define</font>

800
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:29,420
some kind of schema for for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> element</font>

801
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:31,790
we have created<font color="#E5E5E5"> a section as a</font>

802
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:36,250
placeholder for that schema but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

803
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:39,380
yet to to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually write such a schema</font>

804
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:42,680
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big question that we have as far</font>

805
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,630
as defining the schema for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly</font>

806
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,720
namespace and you know to describe the

807
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:51,380
format element is should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use the</font>

808
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,330
relax ng compact schema format for

809
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:57,140
describing this schema or should we use

810
00:40:53,330 --> 00:41:00,140
xml schema in this case i'm the reason i

811
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:03,710
ask is all of the other atom documents

812
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:06,799
use relax ng compact syntax and since

813
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:11,390
this is largely a an extension of of

814
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:18,310
Adam we might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay consistent</font>

815
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:21,230
with those underlying specs any thoughts

816
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:24,820
Roman<font color="#CCCCCC"> janay do I say consistency with</font>

817
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,820

extending Adam stuff if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

823
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:51,040
in the same format that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

824
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:56,830
thank you any other comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

825
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:58,720
great data model enumeration so we've

826
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:01,180
talked about adding this information

827
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,930
type extension point through an eye on a

828
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,879
registry another option is each

829
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:10,330
information type could have an explicit

830
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,360
enumeration of the data models that can

831
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:16,540
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> supported for a given information</font>

832
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,600
type so this would be effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font>

833
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:22,620
of restricting the list of available

834
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:26,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">information models or I'm sorry the on</font>

835
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:28,270
the list of possible data models that

836
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:34,180
could be used for a given information

837
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:38,880
type to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre registered set of data</font>

838
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:42,430
models this could help set some

839
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,310
expectation from producer consumer

840
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:48,819
perspective on on what data might be

841
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:51,490
seen in a given repository<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it may</font>

842
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:55,090
discourage flexibility in preventing

843
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:56,620
providers from using other models that

844
00:42:55,090 --> 00:43:00,130
may be<font color="#CCCCCC"> appropriate for a given</font>

845
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:02,470
information type over time so our

846
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:04,870
question is should information types

847
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:07,379
have explicitly listed data models or

848
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:10,029
should we keep it open ended and

849
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:13,990
effectively use the format element to

850
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:15,820
describe whatever is being used Roman so

851
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,770
Roman<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you clarifying questions so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

852
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,840
we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the second bullet which is</font>

853
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,820
information types explicitly numerate

854
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,230
does that precludes the option of

855
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,120
extensibility so we're saying at

856
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:26,560
publication<font color="#CCCCCC"> job whatever is in the list</font>

857
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what's in the list and we can't do</font>

858
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore well I would guess it would</font>

859
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:33,970
depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we made it like a must or</font>

860
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:36,250
should kind of requirements whether

861
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:37,000
whether it has to be a value that's in

862
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:40,030
the register

863
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,190
or not I would generally favored

864
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:44,260
something that's extensible so you know

865
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:46,060
it so it's easier to add new formats

866
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,820
we're not envisioning right now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

867
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:50,440
want your so we basically have a choice

868
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,120
as to whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of take an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

869
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">world assumption or closed world</font>

870
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,020
assumption you're going for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the open</font>

871
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,580
world you know i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would i would say let's</font>

872
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,340
register them in an eye on a table and

873
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:02,620
we can extend new formats we're not

874
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,230
envisioning up so we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a must</font>

875
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:09,270
requirement that would say effectively

876
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:09,270
require registration for it to be used

877
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:19,720
yes probably with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the caveat that we</font>

878
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:22,510
might also want to support something

879
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,950
private yeah so what happens if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

880
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use rowley for a formatted when I</font>

881
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,529
tell everyone something else about and

882
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,730
that sounds like we might need more

883
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,500
machinery for that so we should probably

884
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,550
talk about it more see whether there's

885
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,780
really interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in doing that but I</font>

886
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:33,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">would argue something extensible and I</font>

887
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,750
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> argue for private things I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

888
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,540
have to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks about so that would</font>

889
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:45,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">be not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> n registry any</font>

890
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:46,990
other thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we need to work</font>

891
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:52,029
out some of that machinery so I'll take

892
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:55,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to the list as well so uh work</font>

893
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:58,180
that's left to do I've got some work on

894
00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:03,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security considerations section to</font>

895
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:06,580
do it's a little anemic right now we

896
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:09,310
have done a lot to flesh out the ionic

897
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,690
consideration section of the draft it

898
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:12,100
was kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting the previous</font>

899
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:14,650
draft made it through<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group last</font>

900
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:17,710
call but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of to do stubs</font>

901
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the in the ionic considerations</font>

902
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:24,010
section so it probably didn't get a lot

903
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:31,150
of review now that's much more fleshed

904
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:35,440
out we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to finish up the sub</font>

905
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:37,900
registry for IETF forums<font color="#E5E5E5"> rowley to</font>

906
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,140
support the information type category

907
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:43,180
scheme by doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that also sets us up</font>

908
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:46,089
to add other types of category schemes

909
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:49,770
if any of the use case documents might

910
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,770
want to add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new category</font>

911
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:55,300
so we have some work to do there the

912
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:58,830
appendix contains a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the use case</font>

913
00:45:55,300 --> 00:46:02,740
examples that were in the original draft

914
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:05,799
there's some major inaccuracies relative

915
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:08,140
to Adam in some of those examples and

916
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,720
they're not entirely consistent with the

917
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:13,600
draft at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment so there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

918
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:18,310
cleanup work that needs to be done on on

919
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:20,500
those use cases we need to finish doing

920
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:24,029
the work now that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a sense</font>

921
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:29,800
of what needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done on Roli formats</font>

922
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:32,980
so there's there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly anemic TLS</font>

923
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,770
requirements in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft there's</font>

924
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:39,610
no rationale that explains why you know

925
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:43,060
mutual authentication is needed so we

926
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:45,940
probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just say a little bit</font>

927
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:48,910
more around the the use of TLS and the

928
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:51,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft there were a lot of mentions of</font>

929
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:53,830
user authentication and authorization

930
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,440
requirements in the original<font color="#CCCCCC"> rowley</font>

931
00:46:53,830 --> 00:47:00,670
draft there was a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> section that</font>

932
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:04,630
was talking about exact amol we're not

933
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:07,540
certain that we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do specific user</font>

934
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:10,210
authentication authorization schemes in

935
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,130
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> cord draft because there's a lot of</font>

936
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:18,360
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> options that organizations</font>

937
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:21,220
could choose from one option<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be to</font>

938
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,810
you know to do some companion drafts to

939
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:26,140
the core that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how you</font>

940
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:30,330
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> use various authentication and</font>

941
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:32,770
authorization schemes with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core</font>

942
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:36,310
that's an issue that we plan to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

943
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:39,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the list for further discussion then</font>

944
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:43,240
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowley draft used</font>

945
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:46,570
open search as a mechanism to support

946
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:50,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">defining search templates and allowing</font>

947
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:54,100
for search of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the repository and</font>

948
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:57,910
specific feeds that was very under

949
00:47:54,100 --> 00:48:00,549
specified in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the original draft and is</font>

950
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:03,399
still somewhat under specified so I

951
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,300
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to explore open search a</font>

952
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,130
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more</font>

953
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,530
better understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to be</font>

954
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:11,320
used in this in this case so we've got

955
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:16,390
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> work to do there as well a next</font>

956
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:18,070
slide please so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh we have currently</font>

957
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">published revision three of the draft</font>

958
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:22,270
we're definitely looking for feedback

959
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:25,480
many reviews on the draft would be

960
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:30,580
appreciated we're actively working on

961
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:34,420
the seesaw use case document we're

962
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:36,910
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have that document be have a</font>

963
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:38,890
call for<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group adoption once we</font>

964
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:41,040
can get a completed version of that

965
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:43,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft out there and it's effectively</font>

966
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,840
content that the the working group is

967
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:50,950
previously adopted because it was it was

968
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:52,870
moved out of the the current draft so

969
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:57,850
we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get that back I'm in front</font>

970
00:48:52,870 --> 00:49:00,370
of the working group and then there's a

971
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:01,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of other extension</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use case</font>

972
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:05,890
extension documents that we're thinking

973
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">about doing for Rowley so one around</font>

974
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:10,540
software management information if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

975
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,040
carry information like sweet tags

976
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:16,210
something that we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot about</font>

977
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:18,430
in n sockem maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> 14</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration</font>

978
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:22,810
checklist information like s cap

979
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:25,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">checklist as an example and and then one</font>

980
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:29,380
on vulnerability records for various

981
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:32,380
vulnerability bulletins that that you

982
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:36,900
know vendors might publish those could

983
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:41,500
also be published as a as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolly feed</font>

984
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:44,680
so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas we would</font>

985
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:47,860
be happy to collaborate with with anyone

986
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:49,569
interested in these topics on on writing

987
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">east cases drafts so if you're</font>

988
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:58,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in working on one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

989
00:49:51,700 --> 00:50:04,450
topics come come talk to us and that's

990
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:06,610
it thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so Dave the priority here</font>

991
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:11,439
is to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we could get the</font>

992
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:15,840
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> rowley draft moving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward so do</font>

993
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,920
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need more review and revision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 ah</font>

994
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,930
before you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next draft</font>

995
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:24,040
can you get the next draft out and the

996
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:26,319
question is by when so our milestone is

997
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,540
to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this I mean I'm going to</font>

998
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,880
be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shepherd for this so the question</font>

999
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,619
is can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we meet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the November deadline</font>

1000
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,410
yeah I think that's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> doable</font>

1001
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can probably get another</font>

1002
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:41,649
draft out to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address the you</font>

1003
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,569
know the only take us a couple weeks to

1004
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:46,030
get a draft out to address the issues

1005
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:47,829
the question is we have some discussion

1006
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:50,140
to do on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll right we'll</font>

1007
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:51,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably need a couple weeks to talk</font>

1008
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">through those issues so maybe a month</font>

1009
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:57,720
from now we could have another another

1010
00:50:53,589 --> 00:51:01,000
draft um so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna look to Kathleen</font>

1011
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:05,200
we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a lot of review on this</font>

1012
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,670
how much should we expect solicit before

1013
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,669
we can push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

1014
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kathleen Moriarty one thing with this</font>

1015
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:26,700
draft it was well written to begin with

1016
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:28,890
yeah so if folks are reading the draft

1017
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,810
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think it looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good we need to</font>

1018
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:32,879
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right so could you please at</font>

1019
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:35,670
least send to the list I read the draft

1020
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,280
it looks good so that we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1021
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,960
getting reviews and how many people plan

1022
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,590
to review it would be really helpful to

1023
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:46,530
know so can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a show of hands of</font>

1024
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:54,090
who plans to review it two three four

1025
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:56,640
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay six reviewers I got seven</font>

1026
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:59,370
and talking so maybe eight even so that

1027
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,020
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really good forgot that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many we</font>

1028
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:02,549
could also reach out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> second maybe</font>

1029
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:10,050
there would be folks there that would

1030
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:12,930
review it as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so maybe Dave when you</font>

1031
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the new draft out I can put the</font>

1032
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:21,180
notice where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can to second to get</font>

1033
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:22,860
more reviews and then depending on the

1034
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:26,069
feedback may be in the September

1035
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:27,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kathleen we can put out two mile to see</font>

1036
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:29,580
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are no objections to just move</font>

1037
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:33,920
it forward and I can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the write up</font>

1038
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,920
okay great<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

1039
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,720
hi I'm Nancy<font color="#CCCCCC"> cam wounded again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1040
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:00,120
have no slides because I presented the

1041
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:03,600
overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> XMPP three times now and I</font>

1042
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:06,660
figured I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1043
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:10,500
I did get some feedback from taki thank

1044
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:13,589
you most of them i consider the feedback

1045
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:16,620
to be more mainly on the editorial side

1046
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:24,080
of and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide more</font>

1047
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:29,810
clarity<font color="#CCCCCC"> okie on points like how would a</font>

1048
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:34,590
client find an exit MPP server and in

1049
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:36,870
XMPP speak they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about topics the</font>

1050
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:41,340
topics could be construed as<font color="#E5E5E5"> data models</font>

1051
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:44,310
in the context here<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so there were</font>

1052
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:47,850
kind of the two-level love you can have

1053
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:50,730
many topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those can also be</font>

1054
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:54,210
discoverable so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will respond to that</font>

1055
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:56,820
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> email list as well to that</font>

1056
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:59,940
feedback and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be revving the draft</font>

1057
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:02,910
to provide a little better clarity so

1058
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:05,400
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only update i have the</font>

1059
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:08,250
question is whether this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font>

1060
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,710
individual author would really like to

1061
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:15,840
solicit more feedback so that we can

1062
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:21,900
move this forward Chris we're still in

1063
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:30,060
revision 0 but that was when it was in

1064
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:35,130
sockem<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I but no i thought i did a</font>

1065
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:37,350
dress<font color="#E5E5E5"> i addressed them there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz there</font>

1066
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:39,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">was we were up to revision 2 in sac them</font>

1067
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:41,700
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if Chris aussie i mean i read it</font>

1068
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and reviewed it in in sac um I assume</font>

1069
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:45,629
there are a handful of others who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1070
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:47,580
done that so I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at it in</font>

1071
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:50,040
mile because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font>

1072
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:53,549
been any the only thing I didn't to

1073
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:57,930
review right the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> change i made from</font>

1074
00:54:53,550 --> 00:55:00,600
the second to the mile shift was I

1075
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:04,410
removed the sack of applicability to

1076
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:06,930
make the document shorter in hopes that

1077
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:11,040
people would actually read it so having

1078
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:18,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">a few updates happy to review but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1079
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:21,600
thanks Chris I just wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font>

1080
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:23,790
and Christian Takei see I maybe it's

1081
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:27,270
because of my reading program but when I

1082
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:30,690
really dis draft I was not finding a

1083
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:33,030
world must so I wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> with her what</font>

1084
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:35,250
would what what you are defining was not

1085
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:37,710
so clear to me so you are showing a

1086
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:40,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">little example how to use XMPP for the</font>

1087
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:43,920
purpose of XMPP great but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

1088
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:46,109
build our implement XMPP great what is

1089
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,970
requirement is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not clear to me so he</font>

1090
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:53,670
could clarify that that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful</font>

1091
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:56,850
for me okay let me rephrase sorry in the

1092
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:59,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft you have shown a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of examples</font>

1093
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:02,930
yes but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take a look at our Rory</font>

1094
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:05,460
draft Norwich what defines some kind of

1095
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:08,399
syntax or maybe some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wave</font>

1096
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:11,540
writing but in case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this draft usual</font>

1097
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:15,210
example so I wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what they find</font>

1098
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:17,370
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a wave writing if you could</font>

1099
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:19,860
just define what is necessary to

1100
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:26,040
implement a<font color="#CCCCCC"> complete route that would be</font>

1101
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:28,710
helpful for me just a comment so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kristen</font>

1102
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:31,080
a CO and I'm gonna try and answer a

1103
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:34,200
little bit of your comment but Nancy you

1104
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:36,779
need to correct me<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm wrong the XMPP</font>

1105
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,490
grid doesn't define what data it's going

1106
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,670
to transfer only a mechanism to

1107
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:43,879
coordinate and exchange data so the the

1108
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:48,450
musts are very limited because of that

1109
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:50,940
so it's really the describing<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to use</font>

1110
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:52,470
XMPP and the infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

1111
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,280
coordination and send the messages

1112
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:59,730
whereas the messages are still left as

1113
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:02,100
additions to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to XMPP right so and that's</font>

1114
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:05,940
fun on so as I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

1115
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:08,819
how to answer taki right the liaison as

1116
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">I understand it is mile has adopted the</font>

1117
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">IO deaf as the format and i construe</font>

1118
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,450
that as the data model or capability and

1119
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,420
that's what we were trying

1120
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:24,868
not where we are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe in</font>

1121
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:27,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the draft is given that mile has defined</font>

1122
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:31,230
that data model you can now transport it

1123
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:34,260
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the requirements of the</font>

1124
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:37,079
application so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can transport it</font>

1125
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:40,619
either using asynchronous meaning a

1126
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:42,920
query or if you need updates on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IO</font>

1127
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:47,430
def information you could register

1128
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:49,530
meaning subscribe to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the updates to</font>

1129
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:52,379
that information using the pub sub

1130
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:54,540
mechanism so I mean and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I'm</font>

1131
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,760
kind of struggling of I don't know where

1132
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:59,550
there would be a must there i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

1133
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:04,589
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> kathleen wright um but I'd be happy</font>

1134
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:07,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to if there are clarifications that need</font>

1135
00:58:04,589 --> 00:58:15,328
to be made there you know the ad text

1136
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:17,700
around that too so Kathleen Moriarty um

1137
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:20,130
I wouldn't add musts unless they're

1138
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,960
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you know look for specific</font>

1139
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:24,329
examples so taka if you're reading

1140
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">through and you see a section where you</font>

1141
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:29,550
think normative language needs to be

1142
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,740
applied call out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that specific section</font>

1143
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:33,780
and then it can be reviewed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nancy and</font>

1144
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:35,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group to decide if that's</font>

1145
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,740
appropriate because we don't want to put

1146
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:40,109
in requirements that aren't necessary

1147
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:41,700
but if they are needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that we have</font>

1148
00:58:40,109 --> 00:58:46,200
interoperability then of course we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:25,169
done and proceed because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1235
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:09,380
XML XML structure text is very

1236
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:11,779
expressive and flexible but it is very

1237
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:14,660
heavy for passing passing happiness is a

1238
01:05:11,779 --> 01:05:17,329
problem for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I'm for Jason Jesus</font>

1239
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:19,640
structured data so it is simple and easy

1240
01:05:17,329 --> 01:05:21,650
to define the data types and lightweight

1241
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:24,440
for passing like it passing the very

1242
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:26,329
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our use case but this is</font>

01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,250
just my personal view I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not asking you</font>

1244
01:05:26,329 --> 01:05:29,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the correct or not but</font>

1245
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:33,619
depending on the use<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is the</font>

1246
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:36,619
preferred let me give her up if you

1247

1249
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:45,109
still wrong ah um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to call out</font>

1250
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:50,000
your name this is like the difference is

1251
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:52,519
minor in some sense but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the do</font>

1252
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,529
you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go shoot up um no</font>

01:05:52,519 --> 01:06:00,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah so um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the size is different</font>

1254
01:05:57,529 --> 01:06:02,450
are you making<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one case you some</font>

1255
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:05,390
people so you have schemas for<font color="#CCCCCC"> chase on</font>

1256
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:07,399
you have schemas for xml but the

1257
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:09,049
encoding<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's just the way you</font>

1258
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,839
include the data is different and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

1259
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:13,339
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add our latest pet in the game</font>

1260
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,828
which we're going to discuss a little

1261
01:06:13,339 --> 01:06:18,380
later today in this session you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can add</font>

1262
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">a column for SIBO if you want to have</font>

1263
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:21,740
not chase on because Jason is still a

1264
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:25,180
little bit bloated you can have it even

1265
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:25,180
smaller than go for SIBO

1266
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kathleen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Moriarty so the reason they're</font>

1267
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:36,240
exploring this is that Jason will

1268
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:39,119
actually get used more and that's a

1269
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,709
reasonable reason to go ahead um if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">F is going to sit there because it's an</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sudden it gets used a heck of a lot more</font>

1273
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:53,760
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason to go ahead and I I</font>

1274
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:58,950

01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:35,819
provide a large automatically that's

1288
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:38,609
what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> as our application but for</font>

1289
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:42,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">that purpose let me just show you what</font>

1290
01:07:38,609 --> 01:07:45,960
we have by clicking on here which

1291
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:58,850
insists a figure of this pray over the

1292
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:58,850
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

1293
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:06,720
so maybe house in this system before so

1294
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:08,220
we have this kind of system so we are

1295
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,379
monitoring traffic coming to the

1296
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:12,930
document address of our organization

1297
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:14,580
here we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a office the pocket are</font>

1298
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:17,069
coming to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> background address of our</font>

1299
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:19,109
organization so they as an indicator a

1300
01:08:17,069 --> 01:08:21,689
kind of indicator of malicious activity

1301
01:08:19,109 --> 01:08:24,210
so based on the traffic we<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyze and</font>

1302
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:26,279
we provide a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot automatically we do not</font>

1303
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:28,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">have operator we just do automatic</font>

1304
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:30,929
analysis and send a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell member</font>

1305
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:38,000
organizations that what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1306
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:43,650
yeah and sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes in some</font>

1307
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:46,800
so we have more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 organizations</font>

1308
01:08:43,649 --> 01:08:50,819
using our system so why not using a

1309
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:53,460
standard format so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

1310
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:56,219
standard format for the alert and also

1311
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:59,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to make the alert usable for the</font>

1312
01:08:56,220 --> 01:09:01,830
program we won't do that program

1313
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:04,189
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we want that</font>

1314
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:07,380
program take action three ash

1315
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:10,830
automatically so for this purpose xml l

1316
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:12,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">was not usable for my use cases so we</font>

1317
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:16,140
wanted have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit Jason biting look shy</font>

1318
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:19,290
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is our current alert</font>

1319
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:23,400
eating xml we have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> xml are at and</font>

1320
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:29,339
also takes description allowed so this

1321
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:32,069
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a excellent abrasion so as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can as</font>

1322
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:34,260
you can see the red one is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> content the</font>

1323
01:09:32,069 --> 01:09:36,330
time and also IP address important about

1324
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:39,089
whatever the product laterz are just a

1325
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:41,819
tag so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see in this message</font>

1326
01:09:39,089 --> 01:09:47,029
the content that source mall so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1327
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:50,549
this is redundant could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys this is</font>

1328
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:52,500
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the text message we use email this</font>

1329
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:54,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">is much more readable actually we are</font>

1330
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,700
using this kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> taste alerting as</font>

1331
01:09:54,029 --> 01:09:58,860
well but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not usable for program</font>

1332
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:02,010
so why don't we have something in

1333
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:04,259
between between xml and also text that

1334
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:11,570
could be json possible by the way I

1335
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:11,570
don't you see bore as well yes

1336
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:26,219
this way next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one yes ok one more please</font>

1337
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:28,740
so it's a small I guess sorry yeah why

1338
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:31,100
dr. to mature Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> teach at your computer</font>

1339
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:31,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">switch</font>

1340
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:56,290
so currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are building a JSON</font>

1341
01:10:52,059 --> 01:10:59,710
binding so the easiest way to build a

1342
01:10:56,290 --> 01:11:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">JSON is converting from XML directory</font>

1343
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:04,239
it's easy to convert but we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1344
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:06,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a direct conversion you want to</font>

1345
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:08,678
have something more so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we</font>

1346
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:11,980
want to do of course we want to maintain

1347
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:13,719
compatibility with iOS version 2 so we

1348
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:16,150
want to compatible<font color="#E5E5E5"> with iOS version 2</font>

1349
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:17,710
and also expressiveness is not

1350
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:19,480
increasing because this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

1351
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:22,150
binding it's not extend its not

1352
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:24,339
extension it's just a binding so we want

1353
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:26,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">to we do not want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase</font>

1354
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:29,050
expressiveness and we also want to

1355
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:30,519
consider compatibility with sticks you

1356
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:32,889
know the latest verge of the sticks is

1357
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:36,010
using JSON so why not including that

1358
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:38,530
obvious as well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also Delta</font>

1359
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:40,329
prepare some tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cope with issues</font>

1360
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:43,989
so we will provide conversion tool for

1361
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:47,049
free so here what we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> define more</font>

1362
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:48,909
is a facilitation for description for

1363
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:52,840
instance we want to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of</font>

1364
01:11:48,909 --> 01:11:57,129
the element for instance in iof we have

1365
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:59,170
hot pot is array actually in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML in</font>

1366
01:11:57,130 --> 01:12:01,329
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> with XML is easy to understand its</font>

1367
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:04,570
array because we have a schemer but

1368
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:06,880
engage with a JSON we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to use</font>

1369
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:09,219
a schema at all in this case why don't

1370
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,409
we have a name like this photo<font color="#E5E5E5"> list the</font>

1371
01:12:09,219 --> 01:12:16,210
name itself can identify that we are

1372
01:12:11,409 --> 01:12:18,848
using array it's easier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we have</font>

1373
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:21,099
to change we order to provide some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1374
01:12:18,849 --> 01:12:25,179
of simplified expression for instance

1375
01:12:21,099 --> 01:12:29,500
engage with our XML in k to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iotv xml</font>

1376
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:32,320
we have a field for a dress and field

1377
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:38,309
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> port but why don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> combine</font>

1378
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:40,599
that by using semicolon it's easy yes

1379
01:12:38,309 --> 01:12:42,010
take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good question on the previous</font>

1380
01:12:40,599 --> 01:12:44,409
slide so you said that you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

1381
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:45,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to increase the expressiveness at</font>

1382
01:12:44,409 --> 01:12:48,009
the same time you're not gonna try to

1383
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,230
decrease the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expressiveness right here</font>

1384
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:54,540
you basically want to include all of the

1385
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:57,730
same content that can be expressed in

1386
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:59,679
Justin and I are deaf or the increased

1387
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:01,388
minutes agree but for the decrease penis

1388
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:02,739
it could be decreasing I don't know

1389
01:13:01,389 --> 01:13:05,349
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expression is what</font>

1390
01:13:02,739 --> 01:13:08,018
<font color="#CCCCCC">jason is not the same as that xml so</font>

1391
01:13:05,349 --> 01:13:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes it could be decreasing could</font>

1392
01:13:08,019 --> 01:13:11,829
you save for everything that is done in

1393
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:14,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">XML there should be an equivalent way to</font>

1394
01:13:11,829 --> 01:13:17,159
do it in JSON I would try as much as

1395
01:13:14,949 --> 01:13:19,960
possible the thought I can say I guess

1396
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:24,009
so it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a subset potentially</font>

1397
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:26,559
of the current I think sorry yes but so

1398
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:31,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">long got using JSON this is this must be</font>

1399
01:13:26,559 --> 01:13:35,050
the best we can do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

1400
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:38,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand that better thank you next so</font>

1401
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:41,650
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the example we in the earlier</font>

1402
01:13:38,139 --> 01:13:45,340
presentation we we have shown the format

1403
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:49,089
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the alert this is the iOS version to</font>

1404
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:51,940
a Jason we created<font color="#CCCCCC"> iotic button to in</font>

1405
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:54,909
XML directly converted them into JSON

1406
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:57,610
then the result is like this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is far</font>

1407
01:13:54,909 --> 01:14:00,879
from not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good looking so we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1408
01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:04,030
modify a bit of the place exists for

1409
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:06,460
instance in XML of the iodine present to

1410
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:09,340
node is required that's why if we

1411
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:11,650
convert automatically we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind</font>

1412
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:15,550
of place we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

1413
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:17,199
also we have a IP address the type of

1414
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:19,630
the IP address under code number

1415
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:22,329
everywhere it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be just agree</font>

1416
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:26,440
aggregated so for this purpose we want

1417
01:14:22,329 --> 01:14:31,808
to specify some draft on this that's our

1418
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:34,749
motivation yeah so based on that I have

1419
01:14:31,809 --> 01:14:37,599
published the first version in the

1420
01:14:34,749 --> 01:14:41,499
mailing list so I hope you can review it

1421
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:45,130
and I have three<font color="#E5E5E5"> question after the</font>

1422
01:14:41,499 --> 01:14:47,679
first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I had some difficulty to</font>

1423
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:50,769
define the contents because you know in

1424
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,469
case of XML we have a schemer so if it's

1425
01:14:50,769 --> 01:14:55,840
easy to define but in case with Jason I

1426
01:14:53,469 --> 01:14:59,380
don't know whether we can use the schema

1427
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:01,860
for writing a specification or we have

1476
01:17:55,889 --> 01:18:00,980

1477
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:19,139
okay well until we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a document i'm</font>

1478
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:20,730
not sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it makes sense I feel like</font>

1479
01:18:19,139 --> 01:18:24,869
we should be held responsible to

1480
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:32,848
actually provide that back as a as a

1481

mild stem a div altameyer so yeah and

01:18:32,849 --> 01:18:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the process of generalizing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rowley we</font>

01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:42,750
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be providing that back since I was</font>

1487
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:47,520

responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for providing that back yeah</font>
