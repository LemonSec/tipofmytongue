1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,190
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> risky three things one is what</font>

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,680
are the basics of<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights unless it</font>

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,629
means human rights secondly what is the

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,090
link between businesses and human rights

5
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:18,439
and thirdly as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I so mention I want to</font>

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,170
speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the specific project that i</font>

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,150
work on ranking digital rights I just

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,100
introduce myself my name is Alan<font color="#E5E5E5"> ba and</font>

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,990
I'm the polishing engaging manager of

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">rank image</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right I'm also visiting</font>

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,019
fellow here in Berlin with shifting

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:36,440
noise on Thornton so let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump to</font>

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:01:05,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first slide if this slide thing</font>

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:01:08,240
jumps let's see is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> another alright</font>

15
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:10,548
so the first question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have on here is</font>

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,960
what are human rights so I thought

17
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,850
rather than giving you a specific

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,229
definition of what is understood as

19
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,479
human rights and international legal

20
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:19,010
terms or something like that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font>

21
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,048
here in the audience what you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

22
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,820
human<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights or maybe it's put it</font>

23
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:25,310
differently what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you believe are</font>

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,559
things that every human being around the

25
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,869
world regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their nationality</font>

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,630
the religion color of their skin etc

27
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:35,799
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be entitled to do any of you have</font>

28
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:38,298

up cells from getting yeah being treated

33
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,490
the same regardless of nationality

34

exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> as to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my sense term human rights</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">last few decades so how has it come</font>

64
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:14,019
about human rights especially gay notion

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,850
shortly after Second<font color="#CCCCCC"> World War when with</font>

66
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:18,070
establishment the United Nations and the

United Nations Charter establishing

human rights as something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to strive for</font>

69
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,100
there was an understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be actions damita</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of</font>

of people experiencing a second world

war specifically and also other<font color="#CCCCCC"> forwards</font>

74
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happened they will obviously in</font>

75
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,739
centuries and many and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Natalia before</font>

76
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,358
that in 1948 Universal Declaration of

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,239
Human Rights was adopted as the first

78
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:47,709
clear document outlining what human

79
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,329
rights should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be two decades later there</font>

80
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,459
were treaties<font color="#CCCCCC"> for between governments</font>

81
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:54,209
that agree with each other and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

82
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,350
the sort of things that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and</font>

83
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,940
protect every human being around the

84
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,400
world of these are the rights to every

85
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,049
individual should have these were both

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,079
civil and political rights weezer also

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:08,730
writes the twins and direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

88
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:11,350
cultural economic and social rights in

89
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,078
the decades after<font color="#E5E5E5"> Human Rights gained</font>

90
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,180
much more traction and to my believe

91
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:19,478
this is partly because words actions

92
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,769
were used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past such as social</font>

justice to advance for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cause</font>

94
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,370
and that rallied people around certain

95
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,990
causes were replaced<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the more</font>

more tangible and which made it more

101
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,909

104
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,889
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality is that human rights are</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> universally respected I think we can</font>

106
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,000
all think of examples where we've seen

107
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,630
that human rights are violated or

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,620
individuals from rice<font color="#E5E5E5"> are risks there is</font>

116
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">are many such examples where we see that</font>

117
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,479
human rights are under threat so even

118
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:23,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">though we said well every human being</font>

examples where human rights are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

protected and not respected next time

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:37,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">please so just giving all sorts of</font>

you are always thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the states</font>

as the main violator but also is the

main protector for<font color="#CCCCCC"> human rights the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">states will be the ones responsible for</font>

130
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,520
making sure that individuals have the

individuals human rights please sounds

138
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:22,849
again so making access to the businesses

140
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:31,250
basis providing information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about people</font>

that allows other<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization or AIDS</font>

142
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,770
other organizations to

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,780
infringe on their human rights so

144
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,289
exposing people to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights</font>

145
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,419
violation through your business practice

146
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:46,870
and just straight-out taking away

149
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,640
houses and stuff right yeah so these are

150
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,490
all very good examples absolutely other

151
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,460
examples we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of our supply</font>

152
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:05,140
chain issues for example when<font color="#CCCCCC"> a business</font>

153
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:07,750
uses child<font color="#E5E5E5"> labor or when a company hires</font>

154
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,150
private or government security guards to

155
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,490
crack down on demonstration side of the

156
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,289
factory so business can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in</font>

00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">florida's this is the solution to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">everything and all human rights will be</font>

different actors inning stays civil

169

society others have come together

170
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,410
including businesses to say what should

171
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the standards be when we think about</font>

172
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,840
human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights and how we should respect</font>

173
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:57,280
them and how can we consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

174
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,690
the standards next slide please so the

175
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,250
United Nations guiding principles

176
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,320
consists of three pillars the first one

177
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,300
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state duty to protect human</font>

178
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,520
rights so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of the clear</font>

179
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,740
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs to be set in stone</font>

180
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,419
meaning the state has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary</font>

181
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,240
response base they're the ones that need

182
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:16,380
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that inhabitants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in their</font>

183
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,330
territory have their<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights protected</font>

184
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,460
next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> please secondly there's a</font>

185
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,890
corporate responsibility to respect

186
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,620
human rights so it can't all be on the

187
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">States corporations also need to think</font>

188
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,360
very clearly about what kind of role did

189
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,550
playing how they may affect human rights

190
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,280
what kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions they should make</font>

191
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,199
accordingly and try to find resolve to

192
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,400
make sure that human rights are being

193
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,870
mitigated next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please and this</font>

194
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,340
brings us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the third pillar which is</font>

195
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,590
both should provide access to remedy

196
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,600
meaning if an individual finds the

197
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,120
rights being violated i divided States

198
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,010
or by corporation or by cooperation

199
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,560
between the tube there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some</font>

200
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,180
sort of way for them to say I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

201
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,270
have a redress for what has happened

202
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">here I need you to either go to a court</font>

203
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,890
or file a complaint within the company

204
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:09,140
or if some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instrument some sort</font>

205
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,210
of mechanism to say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have my</font>

206
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">right respected and I want to address</font>

207
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,030
what has happened and I need to seek

208
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,829
resolution to this so both states and

209
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:24,410
corporations have responsible to drive

210
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:26,840
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remedy next time going from</font>

211
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,150
the more basics of what human rights are

212
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,310
what the responsibility of business are

213
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,020
you want to touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the reg specific</font>

214
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,750
framework that I work on called ranking

215
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,860
digital rights and how we look at that

216
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:42,260
role of businesses in the ICT sector

217
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,370
visually human rights with ranking which

218
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to release the corporate</font>

219
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,750
accountability index which focuses on

220
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,310
the world's largest technology companies

221
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,950
on how to deal with two very specific

222
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,959
human rights the right privacy and the

223
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,180
right of freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of expression and we</font>

224
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,280
rank companies based on these rights and

225
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:02,900
basically a methodology that looks at

226
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:05,260
these rights next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> please so we do</font>

227
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,430
two things first as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we set standards</font>

228
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,870
meaning it's very difficult to make

229
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,420
anything meaningful measurement or

230
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:14,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">assessment of what technology companies</font>

231
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,250
are doing before being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to say this</font>

232
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,840
is what the behavior should look like so

233
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the first steps or establishing</font>

234
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,470
what the standard should be for

235
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,110
companies as they<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider their human</font>

236
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,790
rights practices second is we're

237
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,830
measuring how companies are performing

238
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,719
basically standards and one bases in

239
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,400
that we're releasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an index with</font>

240
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,500
results for the companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we assess</font>

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,880
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please the court in 2015</font>

242
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,010

system based on 31 indicators in

247
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:51,050
categories of commitment which means the

248
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,940
overall governance structure of

249
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,280
companies and how they deal with human

250
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,370
rights and then the categories<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

freedom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> expression and privacy</font>

essential exit 31 indicators

253
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:09,540
extracted and could you click further

254
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:11,490
and even further so yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a an</font>

255
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,910
animation of sorts included here as you

companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we assess so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

258
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:21,540
globally operating companies the

companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in red I believe and</font>

260

are the Internet companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> communists</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">assess and all these companies together</font>

266
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:41,339
have users around the world so we're

267
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,959
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> focusing your own sort of put a</font>

star in their headquarter location but

they've users around the world next

270
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,089
slide please so the main results I just

271
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,670
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to very briefly highlight here of</font>

272
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:56,310
the index or that most users are in the

273
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,050
dark in terms of how users rights being

274
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,959
creative meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the top performing</font>

275
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,750
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> only scored 65 out of 100 points</font>

276
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,189
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could get in the index and</font>

277
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,319
many companies scored much further

278
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:09,540
sometimes even the low teens even so

279
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:10,649
they only scored twelve percent let's

280
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,149
say over one hundred percent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

281
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,250
could score<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the answer that we look</font>

282
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">for there still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a range between</font>

283
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,139
companies and for all companies there is

284
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,910
clear pathway to improve so the index

285
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,699
that we have released is not meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

286
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,800
of as a tomato to be thrown at companies

287
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,660
but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very helpful instrument for</font>

288
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,160
companies to make sure that they can do

289
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,959
better on how their respective users

290
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,759
rights next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> things two very brief</font>

291
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,589
examples that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you from</font>

292
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,750
our results of specific indicators that

293
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,759
we looked at one are on human rights and

294
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,949
back assessments as I mentioned before

295
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,899

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guiding principles are asking</font>

for is for corporations to<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clearly</font>

299
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,360
think through how they might impact the

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,160
rights of the users in order to do that

301
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,660
they can do human rights impact

302
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,509
assessments or do corporate due

303
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,059
diligence meaning they should have a

304
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:05,610
very clear audit on how the product or

305
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:08,279
services might impact the users for

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,310

forced my intentions agencies to hand

install equipment into their server

some sort inherent mechanism in there

318

that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> put users at risk so all</font>

319
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,590
these sort of questions are very

320
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,450
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for companies to consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

321
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,010

324
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,980
the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a wide range between</font>

327
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,540
ninety percent in terms of having such a

process and disclosing that have such a

this so either they don't do such a

332
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,300
thing or the they're being<font color="#E5E5E5"> concessionary</font>

another indicator to highlight is on

the top-performing companies called only

fifty percent most companies score

342
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,800
somewhere around twenty percent or even

343
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,810
lower which means that they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

i don't have your bio in front of me

369
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:53,260
good morning everybody my name is madoka

370

ozawa and I'm with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Institute for</font>

human rights and business we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a small</font>

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,080
but global think tank that explores the

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:06,130
relationship between business and

374
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:09,130
international human rights instruments I

375
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,540
am a recovering lawyer I don't know

376
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,689
whether there's such thing as a

377
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,910
recovering engineer but I'm certainly

378
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,930
not a practicing lawyer but my

379
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:22,990
background<font color="#CCCCCC"> is business law and I've been</font>

382
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:32,589
sustainability challenges and worked

383
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:36,550
very closely with John Ruggie who was

384
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:38,350
the instigator and the drafter of the UN

385
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,650
guiding principles that you just heard

386
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,110
about so I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start by framing</font>

387
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:47,230
the conversation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share a little</font>

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:50,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">story this year is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fifth year</font>

anniversary of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UN guiding principles</font>

390
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:56,589
we just celebrated in June the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifth</font>

391
00:16:53,050 --> 00:17:01,449
year anniversary was John Ruggie and I

392
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:06,459
got to ask John John what surprised you

393
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:08,949
most five years hence from the universe

394
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,750
approval endorsement of the guiding

395
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,569
principles by the UN Human Rights

396
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:17,439
Council what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you expect and what</font>

397
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:19,119
surprised you most so John said well you

398
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,490
know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of things that I</font>

399
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,089
didn't expect but one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

400
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:27,660
took me by surprise is that

401
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:30,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations beyond the major</font>

402
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:36,130
multinationals that extractive

403
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:38,168
industries are parallel industries the

404
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,019
the villains that you

405
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:43,480
we think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the business and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Shimon rights context actually the UN</font>

407
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,960
guiding principle seeped and went well

408
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:52,299
beyond them so she said I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

409
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:56,799
have imagined that organizations like

410
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:58,539
fifa which you are familiar with and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

411
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure you're familiar with all sorts of</font>

00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:04,330
their corruption scandal but<font color="#CCCCCC"> he fought</font>

413
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:07,359
actually went ahead and worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> John</font>

Ruggie to put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> place a human rights</font>

415

policy to deal with the lack of all

416
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:15,549
sorts of considerations in their

417
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:18,939
decision-making process said I'd never

418
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:21,429
would have imagined organizations like

419
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:25,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifa would get there FIFA by the way is</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swiss nonprofit so technically outside</font>

421
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:30,190
the purview of value and guiding

422
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,350
principles perhaps because the guiding

423
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,590
principles apply to business enterprises

424
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:38,139
but on the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand FIFA is run like a</font>

425
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,408
business and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could say that their</font>

00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:33,879
human rights or straightforward<font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

444
00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:36,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">rights challenges and dilemmas and that</font>

445
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:39,219
they have many different ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font>

446
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:42,210
with that particular challenge so

447
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:45,039
multiple pathways multiple destinations

448
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,690
yeah and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fascinating thing</font>

449
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,570
about observing how the UN guiding

450
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,510
principles are used by these different

451
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:54,899
organizations and so I

452
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:58,350
want to give you a sense of how that

453
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:01,560
process works and how my organization is

454
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:04,530
is helping facilitate that conversation

455
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,260
and helping the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision-making</font>

456
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:09,510
processes of different organizations

457
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:14,220
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into account a lot of the issues</font>

458
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">are new never thought of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the ICT</font>

459

00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues but now you just heard from alone</font>

461
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,740
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all these issues that are</font>

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:26,340
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that are being expressed in</font>

463
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,070
human rights terms next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please so</font>

464
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:32,820
one of the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we did</font>

465
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:35,189
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UN guiding principles was to</font>

466
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,860
work on certain sectors that perhaps

467
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:41,430
needed more detailed guidance on how to

468
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:43,169
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UN guiding principles and we</font>

469
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,810
were requested by the European

470
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,960
Commission<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with three sector</font>

471
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:51,300
guides so we did one on oil and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gas one</font>

472
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,180
on employment agencies and the third one

00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,590
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ICT sector this is a joint</font>

475
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:02,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization called shift and basically</font>

476
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:06,629
this was the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS one on one</font>

for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICT sector and basically the</font>

478
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:12,900
nutshell of it is look there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are common</font>

479
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,240
due diligence steps that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could take</font>

480
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,970
to understand the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights impacts</font>

481
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,910
of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization's and to address</font>

482
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">them so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the six steps to have a</font>

483
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,610
human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights policy to assess the human</font>

485
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,929
organization if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are negative</font>

486
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,080
impacts first to prevent and second to

487
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:36,930
mitigate those impacts to<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

488
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,939
track your performance over time to

489
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:42,780
communicate your stakeholders what you

490
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,420
are doing and to remedy to extent there

491
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,340
are negative impacts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address those</font>

492
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,130
negative impacts through a grievance

493
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:53,459
mechanisms so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the key steps</font>

494
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the backbone of a human</font>

495
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,650
rights impact assessment which is a

496
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:02,070
method<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inquiry and analysis that will</font>

497
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:04,650
usually ask companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take on board</font>

498
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:09,460
to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> these challenges</font>

499
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:11,500
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving on now the next example is to</font>

500
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:16,060
take this process to a much more

501
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:19,090
specific situation with tech UK this is

502
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:22,929
the work that we did following the Arab

503
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:25,230
Spring discoveries that a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

504
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:28,620
countries were using cyber security

505
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,870
products and services to actually are

506
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,879
basically conduct a mass surveillance

507
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:37,419
with dire consequences for human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights</font>

508
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:40,990
advocacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups and writers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and bloggers</font>

509
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:43,450
who got arrested and detained so the UK

510
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:46,110
government said look this is an industry

511
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:49,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is very important to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us because</font>

512
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:52,360
it's a major source of jobs and revenue

513
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:54,970
at the same time we consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

514
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,610
industry could create reputational risks

515
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:00,580
for themselves but also to the country

516
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,879
as a whole and as a result we want to

517
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:07,270
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guidance on how</font>

518
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,490
cybersecurity firms can incorporate

519
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">human rights considerations when they</font>

520
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:15,490
export their products and services so

521
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:18,610
again there are some basic steps that

522
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:21,790
this guide recommends understand what

523
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:25,030
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> product or services could do how it</font>

524
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:28,090
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be abused understand the country</font>

525
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,980
background in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their laws their</font>

526
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,689
frameworks their human rights track

527
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:36,160
records whether they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable</font>

528
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:38,650
groups and to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you could</font>

529
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,320
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> feasibly that end at use the</font>

530
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:44,290
purchaser<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that exported products and</font>

531
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,750
to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with some mitigating</font>

532
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:49,960
mechanisms including having contractual

533
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:53,080
provisions when you actually do export

534
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,360
and and sell your products and so this

535
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">is basically to address these bunch of</font>

536
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,040
risks that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been identified from a</font>

537
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,500
human rights point of view and to reduce

538
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,120
those as much as possible so what are

539
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,420
the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights risks that this</font>

540
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,479
particular guide try to address they are

internationals practice so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

576
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:50,340
there is a concrete case in which these

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights impact assessment is one</font>

00:25:54,010 --> 00:26:00,310
very specific way to understand human

understanding what has happened what our

00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,360
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> five copies of this particular</font>

flipping through so having done the work

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:51,580
with tech UK with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ericsson when we are</font>

598
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:54,940
approached by a financial institution

599
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:57,699
that wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand how to make a</font>

provide guarantees in connection with

602
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:06,879
export of network systems we came up

603
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:12,070
with this risk assessment framework that

604
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:15,330
involves four p's to look at purpose

605
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:17,950
place product and purchasers to

606
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:21,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand different kinds of risks</font>

607
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:24,640
involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those domains and advise the</font>

608
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:28,330
financial institution on how to make

609
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,230
their decisions go or no-go so if some

610
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:33,370
of these peas are triggered perhaps the

611
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,740
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the particular deal</font>

612
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:38,770
should be elevated at the management

613
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:41,200
level and if all the four PS are

614
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,960
triggered and there are no mitigation

615
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,760
measures then perhaps the financial

616
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,429
institutions should consider not going

617
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,820
forward with that particular transaction

618
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:55,480
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a way to illustrate that</font>

619
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:58,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key theme being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network vendors but</font>

620
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,270
how different human rights rights risks

621
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,929
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> incorporated into various</font>

organizations decision-making next

slides please so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to change</font>

624
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:16,360
a little bit and talk about our

625
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:19,360
engagement with<font color="#E5E5E5"> icon which we've been</font>

626
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:24,159
very happy to do in association with

627
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:28,270
article 19 and we have our leader<font color="#E5E5E5"> Neil's</font>

628
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:31,080
are sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

629
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:34,990
way I understand the current engagement

630
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:37,449
engagement with I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

631
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:40,720
there are two streams of inquiry going

632
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:44,440
on in connection with icons relationship

633
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,720
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights um and one is a sort</font>

634
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,080
of the

635
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,110
a legalistic normative top-down approach

636
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,020
another one more impact specific and

637
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:56,750
ground-up approach both triggered in

638
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:02,480
connection with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICANN Zion a transition</font>

639
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:04,730
and the efforts to basically strengthen

640
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,549
icons accountability visibly its

641
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:10,460
stakeholder groups and I just think both

642
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:12,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these are absolutely fascinating so</font>

643
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,380
at the normative level you might be

644
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">aware that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a decision to amend</font>

645
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:21,020
icons by laws including a decision to

646
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:25,480
include a human rights statement and

647
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:27,830
that reads I can will commit to respect

648
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,400
internationally recognized human rights

649
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,840
as required by applicable law sounds

650
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,900
like something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> got drafted by a</font>

651
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,418
bunch of lawyers and it is so now the

652
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:43,130
challenge is to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what does it</font>

653
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:45,350
mean then two icons operations so there

654
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,450
is a process of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

655
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,030
what the how the bylaws should be

656
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:52,250
interpreted so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

657
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,408
with a frame of interpretation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

658
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,840
particular bylaws on a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

659
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:59,450
trying to define<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that means and</font>

660
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll show you the next diagram Graham in</font>

661
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,929
terms of what specific human rights that

662
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,360
are being addressed but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

663
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:08,419
conversations were having there is due

664
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,879
the UN guiding principles actually apply

665
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:15,169
to I can given that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can is a</font>

666
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,809
California nonprofit and so does is that

667
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:20,419
really relevant well yes on the one hand

668
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:23,120
because I can is set up like a business

669
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:25,190
and it does actually have a huge

670
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,860
influence on business particularly cyber

671
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:30,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">commerce on the other hand I can is</font>

672
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,959
technically not a business itself and so

673
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,928
how do we square the circle or having a

674
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,590
lot of conversations around that and now

675
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:42,409
moving to the bottom so again we are

676
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">also trying to understand icons</font>

677
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:47,419
operations and its<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights impacts</font>

678
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,950
from a very impact specific point of

679
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:51,740
view and so the instrument that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

680
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:54,860
using there is a human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights impact</font>

681
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:57,380
assessment process to understand both

682
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,649
icons impacts

683
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:03,710
us our owner of property physical

684
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:06,320
property and employer of people so there

685
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,780
is a specific human rights footprint as

686
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,780
we call it physical human rights that

687
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:15,170
are violations potentially that we might

688
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:18,680
identify but the bulk of the interesting

689
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:21,470
human rights are impacts will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

690
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:24,980
icons up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a per-application honest</font>

691
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:27,110
policies and so those are the various

692
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,240
domains of conversations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

693
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,879
occurring within<font color="#CCCCCC"> on can and the next</font>

694
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,500
slide please so I'm sorry again you're

695
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,650
not going to be able to start to read

696
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:39,010
this but if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the icon website</font>

697
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:42,140
you'll see this particular visible

698
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:45,680
visualization of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rights</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just think</font>

699
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:48,170
it's very elegantly done so on the

700
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,810
left-hand column there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> various</font>

701
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:53,990
rights that have been identified as

702
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:58,419
being relevant I can right to privacy

703
00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:02,300
freedom of association expression also

704
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:04,820
here I can identify economic social and

705
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:07,040
cultural rights as being relevant as

706
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:11,780
well as a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Human Rights</font>

707
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:14,450
principles so these are rule of law this

708
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:17,860
is about participation in consultation

709
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:20,930
inclusiveness and non-discrimination and

710
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:23,149
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle those are the various</font>

711
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:25,940
attributes that that you could associate

712
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:29,660
with with these rights and towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

713
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:32,090
right hand side are the various on I can

714
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:34,400
policies that could trigger these<font color="#CCCCCC"> human</font>

715
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:37,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">rights so this is still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work in progress</font>

716
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even this might change but I thought</font>

717
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">this might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font>

718
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,370
want to refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

719
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:47,530
conversation and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I just have a</font>

720
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:52,520
few remaining slides specifically on

721
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:54,410
your LGBTI conversation so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

722
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,500
you could skip this one and go to the

723
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:00,140
next one so first and foremost um this

724
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,920
is an issue that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies are</font>

725
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:07,220
grappling with because of being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

726
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:10,450
hire talented employees and being able

727
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:13,420
to retain them be<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

728
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:17,020
means being very conscious of how they

729
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:19,420
treat LGBTI employees and as a result

730
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,940
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interest expressed from</font>

731
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,340
the business community and as a result

732
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,980
in collaboration with the UN Human

733
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:30,520
Rights office we are in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of</font>

734
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:33,220
doing a global consultation on a set of

735
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,950
principles<font color="#E5E5E5"> that businesses can use to</font>

736
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:39,310
put in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> a policy and set of</font>

737
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:41,740
procedures addressing LGBTI issues in

738
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:44,379
their operations again I won't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

739
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,780
the details but if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

740
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">bottom there are three contact names the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that please do feel free to to reach out</font>

to him or to me the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide please</font>

746
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:08,350
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted to highlight one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

747
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,060
coming out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a discussion paper that's</font>

748
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:12,819
circulating which I cannot unfortunately

749
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:14,469
um circulate because it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

750
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,810
public domain because of the sensitivity

751
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,909
issues associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it particularly</font>

752
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:23,350
because there are 73 jurisdictions in

753
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:26,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes being LGBT I person</font>

754
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:29,440
illegal in various ways but alyssa has a

755
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,659
discussion paper and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

756
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,350
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in I'm happy to distribute it</font>

757
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:38,139
to you on a personal basis but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

758
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:41,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a frame that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a company could use to</font>

759
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:44,710
understand when it's making its decision

760
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:47,020
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> where to go for their operations how</font>

761
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,820
to think about their operations so there

762
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:52,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">are three models the first one being</font>

763
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:55,450
when in Rome behave like the Romans so

764
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,790
this means you know if you have an

765
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:01,839
office in country X that might be

766
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:05,290
hostile to LGBTI staff people then

767
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:08,950
basically adapt to local conditions but

768
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:10,930
and give your workers a way to opt out

769
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:13,720
from being<font color="#E5E5E5"> posted to that particular</font>

770
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:17,140
country and this is a compromised

771
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,180
situation but this might lead to

772
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:23,020
eventually the next model which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

773
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:26,080
embassy model which means um York

774
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,060
per policy could be enforced in all the

775
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,370
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> jurisdictions in which you</font>

776
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:34,000
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> business regardless of the national</font>

777
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:36,609
law by creating a safe space within your

778
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,920
quote-unquote embassy and this could

779
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:41,110
help promote tolerance within local

780
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,840
staff and may have other spillover

781
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:46,960
effects and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last model being an</font>

782
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:49,900
advocacy model where you just go and

783
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,900
push as much as possible local

784
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,030
regulations so that they change and this

785
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,520
will have benefit not just to your local

786
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:00,070
staff but other stakeholders within the

787
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,560
country as well so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one decision</font>

788
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:06,790
making framework that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

789
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,870
about pushing through the eventual

790
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:14,890
principles and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last slide please and</font>

791
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:17,920
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment finally on your meeting</font>

792
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:21,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">venue decision making process I thought</font>

793
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might be useful to just show you how</font>

794
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:26,770
human rights organizations and others

795
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of organizations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that deal with</font>

796
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:32,770
somatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights how they make their</font>

797
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">decisions in terms of selection of venue</font>

798
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:37,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a human rights perspective and so</font>

799
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:39,400
here are the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some random</font>

800
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,010
considerations that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want to</font>

801
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,340
think about and these organizations have

802
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:49,120
all the same dilemmas that you do yeah

803
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:51,250
so they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about on whether going to</font>

804
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,830
a particular country and having an

805
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,710
annual meeting whether that all of a

806
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,540
sudden legitimatize what that country<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

807
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:03,190
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of human rights or</font>

808
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:06,460
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> that express a solidarity with</font>

809
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:08,980
the stakeholders<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are active in that</font>

810
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular country so it's a balancing</font>

811
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:14,770
act there's no black or white way of

812
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,390
making this decision but first of all to

813
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,920
generally understand the background of

814
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,410
the country its<font color="#CCCCCC"> human rights</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> track</font>

815
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,140
record do this through looking at

816
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:26,529
different kinds of databases<font color="#CCCCCC"> the State</font>

817
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,900
Department freedom house etc etc but

818
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:32,080
maybe more importantly to understand a

819
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:35,380
visible pattern of human rights abuse in

820
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:37,839
that particular country visa<font color="#E5E5E5"> V</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> R</font>

821
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,880
or series of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rights that are most</font>

822
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,578
relevant to the organization's mission

823
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,670
and values right so i read that

824
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:48,279
inclusiveness is a very important value

825
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:50,230
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this organization well if that's so</font>

826
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:52,390
how does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean in terms of your</font>

827
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:54,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision-making process maybe that's</font>

828
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:58,328
something that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

829
00:37:54,279 --> 00:38:02,140
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the views of the local peers and</font>

830
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:05,259
NGOs<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh would going there make it worse</font>

831
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:07,118
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them or actually better for them so</font>

832
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:08,529
understanding what they are saying from

833
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ground up I think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

834
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:15,940
important um another way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

835
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:18,549
it is what kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association would</font>

836
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,410
you have with the government so what the

837
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:23,019
government somehow<font color="#CCCCCC"> subsidize that</font>

838
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:25,538
meeting would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a free use of</font>

839
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:29,169
facilities would it provide some

840
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:30,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hospitality's travel subsidies and so on</font>

841
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth would they come and address</font>

842
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:35,680
ah the beating these are all

843
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,069
considerations that you might want to

844
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,828
think about and finally and but last but

845
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:44,440
not least the specific safety threats or

846
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:48,309
restrictions to some or all members and

847
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:51,099
also the stakeholders this to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

848
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:54,130
very important human rights concept so

849
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:55,839
um with that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish I I</font>

850
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:58,809
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> through a lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

851
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">at you but I hope it was helpful to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

852
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:04,299
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a glimpse of the fact that</font>

853
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:06,099
other organizations of all sorts of

854
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:09,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">different kinds grapple with these</font>

855
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:11,769
issues not always necessarily with

856
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:18,279
straightforward answers thank you so

857
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:21,430
much thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so um we have time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

858
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:24,400
Q&A we have 15 minutes left and and

859
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the rest of the agenda so we have</font>

860
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,009
our two speakers who would be happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

861
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:33,430
field questions or people have comments

862
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:35,549
now is the time so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

863
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,980
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to and here we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

864
00:39:35,549 --> 00:39:42,579
another mic so Randall Gallants I had a

865
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:45,880
question on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most recent</font>

866
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:48,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides and the last ones you do sit on</font>

867
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,270
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of random considerations</font>

868
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:53,330
about whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> going would help her her</font>

869
00:39:50,270 --> 00:40:03,619
um I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of curious how would</font>

870
00:39:53,330 --> 00:40:09,890
one go about trying to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what</font>

871
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:12,950
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 10 um okay you can both come up</font>

872
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:18,680
and then whoever's whoever to whoever

873
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:23,029
their address yeah yeah so I'll be just

874
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:26,029
very straightforward I think consulting

875
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:29,390
your local stakeholders and NGOs who are

876
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:34,040
active might be one very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick way to</font>

877
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:38,210
address that particular question are

878
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:40,070
there so we have some intends on the

879
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,690
place we have looked something you could

880
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:44,119
call local stakeholders but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you say</font>

881
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:46,790
NGOs can you elaborate on what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

882
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">like other organizations of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

883
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:52,310
ilk two hours or organizations that deal

884
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:57,200
with the issue directly it's probably

885
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:59,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">both okay thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ted hoodie and</font>

886
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,348
luckily this the question I had was also

887
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:05,390
on this slide so<font color="#E5E5E5"> handy that one of the</font>

00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that's interesting about the ITF</font>

889
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:10,460
as an organization is that it has no

890
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:14,359
members it has participants and the

891
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:16,400
participants have various levels of

892
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:19,369
participation which may include coming

893
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,250
to physical meetings or may not and one

894
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:25,490
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our questions as we go through this</font>

895
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:28,310
should we go to a venue or not has

896
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:32,000
commonly been around what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it do to</font>

897
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:33,950
enable or restrict participation but

898
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,820
because we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defined</font>

899
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:41,899
membership it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult for</font>

900
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,250
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to assess this question and many of</font>

901
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,349
the people who've discussed this issue

902
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,080
both in this terms and in kind of

903
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:50,060
broader terms of freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of association</font>

904
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:53,390
or freedom of participation more more

905
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:57,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly I've talked about the economic</font>

906
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:59,160
costs of participation in various venues

907
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:01,710
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was wondering if you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

908
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,170
explore with us given that we have no

909
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:12,690
defined membership how we would conduct

910
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:15,059
such an assessment so I first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all um</font>

911
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:19,559
so I stand corrected that you don't have

912
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:23,849
members but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably a way to</font>

913
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:25,230
pull people who frequently come to your

914
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:27,720
meetings and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there are</font>

915
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:32,190
various mechanisms that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to</font>

916
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:35,970
assess what your participants or would

917
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:37,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">be participants are saying as well as so</font>

918
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:40,319
I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm saying is I would</font>

919
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:43,740
promote a very consultative approach to

920
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:50,788
this which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature of your</font>

921
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:52,589
organization in any event hi I'm

922
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:54,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">literally from the lamb I'm a recovering</font>

923
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:56,099
politician but I currently serve on the

924
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:57,930
ICANN board I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font>

925
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:59,760
situations like this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted to</font>

926
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:02,430
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a couple of examples of how I</font>

927
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,809
did that in my previous board role as

928
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:06,029
far as president of the european Liberal

929
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:08,579
Democrats<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the first thing is that we</font>

930
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:10,380
clearly chose to be an advocate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

931
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:12,150
the advocacy approach because your

932
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,160
politicians and I think our job is

933
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:16,289
changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world so what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would do is</font>

934
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,379
if I for example went to Armenia I would

935
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:22,140
contact the local LGBT organizations

936
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:24,869
there were two usually competing ones

937
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:27,450
and ask is it useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we do something</font>

938
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:29,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you and one of them said yes please</font>

939
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:31,140
can you invite us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your session so</font>

940
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:34,230
that we can say something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

941
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:36,058
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to make a statement and</font>

942
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,579
the other one said actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you</font>

943
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:41,099
come visit<font color="#CCCCCC"> our local gay bar because</font>

944
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:43,079
that would make a huge impact because we

945
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:44,760
were recently firebombed and the fact

946
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,410
that politicians actually enter the gay

947
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,400
bar means we won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be firebombed and we</font>

948
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,828
might actually get some police

949
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,099
protection so so there were different

950
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:55,500
approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we honored them both and</font>

951
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:56,789
we had a meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year in Budapest</font>

952
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,250
because we were deeply concerned about

953
00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:01,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rights situation there who</font>

954
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,930
chose explicitly to go there precisely

955
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:06,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there was a problem and we were</font>

956
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,919
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a platform to to opposition</font>

957
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:09,480
people at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we also invite</font>

958
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,890
the government people so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

959
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,019
to expose me

960
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:15,299
never black and white not not everyone

961
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:17,970
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government is evil and not</font>

962
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the opposition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or on a human</font>

963
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:23,009
rights arena is a saint so it's I think

964
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know to try to listen to all sides</font>

965
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:27,720
and to have used to make statements is

966
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:30,180
really important as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and I was</font>

967
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:34,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously I'm it's my</font>

968
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:35,700
first ITF sorry and I know but I was

969
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,890
think one of the simple things that if

970
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,899
you do guys if I TF decides to go to

971
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,578
Singapore<font color="#CCCCCC"> ena have a cool t-shirt with a</font>

972
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,510
rainbow<font color="#CCCCCC"> flag on it to show if you stand</font>

973
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,220
for diversity mean there's there's

974
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,920
really small things you could already do

975
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:49,200
to to show where you stand if you want

976
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,760
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an inclusive kind of kind of</font>

977
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:59,970
meeting so that's just from my

978
00:44:50,760 --> 00:45:01,470
experience thanks Charles I have various

979
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:05,009
kinds of experiences working in

980
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:08,339
interesting places so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

981
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:10,589
like what at how far do you push the

982
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:13,019
advocacy and the question of you who I

983
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:16,799
are you helping by going or hoping by

984
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:19,740
not going it depends very much on what

985
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:22,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do when you are there right so</font>

986
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:25,399
exactly as you just said if if you are

987
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:28,079
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and supporting human rights and</font>

988
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,450
being clear about that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

989
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,230
different from if you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

990
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:36,808
becoming a propaganda tool for whoever

991
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:40,319
it is who is not supporting human rights

992
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:44,190
who's attacking human rights the outcome

993
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:47,339
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually matters the question I</font>

994
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:49,140
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because again IDF is not</font>

995
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:53,038
an organization with a defined

996
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:58,730
membership is what do you do when you

997
00:45:53,039 --> 00:46:01,349
have rights in conflict so there I

998
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:03,660
personally believe that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

999
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:07,920
right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever kind of sexuality and</font>

1000
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:10,379
gender you want and I personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

1001
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,349
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human right to absolute</font>

1002
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,599
freedom of religion which essentially

1003
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:20,009
implies the right to be what I would

1004
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:22,370
call an antediluvian<font color="#CCCCCC"> bigot and there a</font>

1005
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:25,950
racist bigoted

1006
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:30,000
homophobic person has a right to hold

1007
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:34,850
their opinions and where we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

1008
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,670
conflict is where people's opinions

1009
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:41,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">privately-held</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually put under</font>

1010
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:46,140
pressure there's a clear historic

1011
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:50,220
example those who follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> mozilla of this</font>

1012
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:53,400
playing out in practice how should we

1013
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:56,330
handle that kind of conflict where where

1014
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,470
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say this is</font>

1015
00:46:56,330 --> 00:47:01,799
people's<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion which they have the</font>

1016
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:05,759
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold and to express and this is</font>

1017
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,260
hate speech and depression which to one

1018
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:14,310
of the things which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there</font>

1019
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:15,930
is a right that's that's a really good

1020
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:18,630
question also very difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

1021
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:20,790
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> often comes up elite in terms</font>

1022
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:22,980
of having<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiple rights out there and</font>

1023
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,150
how do you balance different rights how

1024
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,720
do you deal with different<font color="#CCCCCC"> vice and make</font>

1025
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:30,450
a flick with each other and I can't give

1026
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,850
a cookie cutter answer to that I can't

1027
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:34,830
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of how human rising</font>

1028
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,600
considers from human rights petitioners

1029
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,460
standpoint but also in terms of how

1030
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:41,490
human rights have been formulated is

1031
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:43,560
that they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be indivisible meaning</font>

1032
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:46,350
there cannot be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation where we say</font>

1033
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,020
we will go at expense of one human right

1034
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:51,569
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> favour another one which means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1035
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:54,810
in practice there will always be a

1036
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:57,390
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> advance a balancing act but a</font>

1037
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:59,940
difficult act too difficult settlements

1038
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:03,000
are difficult implementation to ensure

1039
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:05,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all rights can be respected and in</font>

the technical entertaining technology

00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:12,480
privacy and security comes up you bring

1043
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,549
up the example freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> expression</font>

freedom of expression freedom of

religion and there is an obligation

00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:21,660
unbelievable<font color="#CCCCCC"> States at least and</font>

1047
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:25,140
corporations have responsibility respect

1048
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:31,710
in that sense that all all rights can be

1049
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:33,000
respect in such way and just to

1050
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:38,130
elaborate further

1051
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:41,550
there are rules within the human rights

1052
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:44,340
doctrine that would say certain rights

1053
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:47,780
can be restricted by governments under

1054
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:50,100
certain circumstances and subject to law

1055
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:53,640
right and there are certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

1056
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:56,970
are absolutely sacrosanct<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the right</font>

1057
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,279
to privacy could be moderated by a

1058
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:02,580
government depending on particular

1059
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:05,850
circumstances subject to law versus

1060
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:10,650
right to be free from torture arbitrary

1061
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:13,440
detention etc those are absolute and so

1062
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:15,540
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are these rules but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think in</font>

1063
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,140
terms of the actual day-to-day

1064
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:22,230
decision-making process it's a balancing

1065
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,970
act and it's a judgment call but it's

1066
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that should be socialized with</font>

1067
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:32,700
an organization right so that everybody

1068
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:34,830
can explain why and how Jericho<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a</font>

among few other things and I'm covering

1071
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:47,970
takes a lot of recovery actually um so I

1072
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:50,009
thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presentation I really</font>

1073
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:54,569
like them I did have a question on you

1074
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:58,050
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> different modes of going to a</font>

particular place no compromise or in the

1076
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Investor mode and I want to ask but</font>

1077
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">ambassador mode and the you know safe</font>

1078
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,990

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking more in terms of</font>

00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,569
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know treat everybody equally we in</font>

1083
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:18,120
this company or organization do or are

1084
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:21,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">you thinking more in terms of you know</font>

1085
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:24,089
protecting the population of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1086
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:25,320
organization from outside influence

1087
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:28,830
there might be some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

1088
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:30,450
illegal for instance in a country so if

1089
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:32,490
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> give us some examples that</font>

1090
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:37,919
would help me understand better what

1091
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:42,859
kinds of things we could do sure so for

1092
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:47,040
example providing benefits to LGBTI

1093
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:51,990
couples that are not legally required

1094
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:55,620
for example um convening a space within

1095
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:57,479
a particular office for<font color="#E5E5E5"> LGBTI employees</font>

1096
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,450
to come together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1097
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,940
issues freely these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some very</font>

1098
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:06,299
concrete examples of what companies can

1099
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,650
do within its own four walls so that's

1100
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,350
what it's talking about within the

1101
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:12,030
embassy compound there are certain

1102
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:14,430
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do despite the</font>

1103
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:16,830
local law and that's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1104
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:18,690
thing from just adapting to local law

1105
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:20,549
and say that's all we do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1106
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:27,270
provide anything over and above that's

1107
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:30,270
the difference hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks for coming here</font>

1108
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:31,920
chatting with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh I'm Dave Crocker</font>

1109
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:33,060
I've been on the continent for more than

1110
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,850
a week so I'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I'm not</font>

1111
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:42,000
recovering from anything I suspect this

1112
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:45,900
discussion needs to make a pretty strong

1113
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,140
distinction between how the IETF

1114
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:52,440
conducts its business versus what sorts

1115
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:56,990
of political or social I'll call it

1116
00:51:52,440 --> 00:52:00,560
advocacy or actions it might take

1117
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:04,350
primarily through showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up somewhere</font>

1118
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:06,810
internally we have a pretty simple model

1119
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:09,600
the execution of it isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> so simple but</font>

1120
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:11,700
the model is were opened everybody show

1121
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:15,420
up participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of discussion or</font>

1122
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:18,930
beginning of discussion the practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1123
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:21,690
that has all sorts of difficulties we

1124
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:24,870
have a history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of coming out of a white</font>

1125
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:27,600
male engineering American culture and

1126
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:29,400
reflect that in many ways that's been a

1127
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:33,920
subject of<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion in recent years</font>

1128
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:37,020
but the the formal model we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is</font>

1129
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:40,050
really quite straightforward the

1130
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:43,410
challenge we've run into is one of

1131
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:45,210
choosing where to show up and pretty

1132
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">much everywhere in the world has some</font>

1133
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:50,630
controversy associated with it so we get

1134
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:53,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to choose sometimes unwittingly</font>

1135
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:56,610
particular issues in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular places</font>

1136
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:59,700
my own<font color="#CCCCCC"> view is that as a rule we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1137
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,570
choose not to be advocates on social

1138
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,290
issues as

1139
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:07,680
an organization we should keep to our

1140
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:10,110
knitting stick to our knitting of being

1141
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:15,779
as inclusive as we are physically

1142
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">capable of being and the challenge here</font>

1143
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:21,120
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question of where to show up is</font>

1144
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:25,350
some places are sufficiently egregious

1145
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:27,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we we agree among ourselves that we</font>

1146
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:28,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up there and the</font>

1147
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:31,500
trouble is there's a lot of places<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1148
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:36,180
are pretty egregious<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we still show</font>

1149
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:38,640
up at so what we can say leave um well

1150
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:41,819
pretty much well since everywhere has

1151
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,259
some controversy some of us are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

1152
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,510
each of us certain to live somewhere

1153
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,660
with controversy we show up in places

1154
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:52,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are pretty offensive for some of</font>

1155
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:55,500
the participants um one minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> left just</font>

1156
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:58,140
FYI with one minute left so so we don't

1157
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:03,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any means of figuring out where to</font>

1158
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:05,879
show up other than spontaneous reactions

1159
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:11,520
guidance that helps us figure that out

1160
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:13,470
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be quite helpful tell us</font>

1161
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:17,009
again I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address that last</font>

1162
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:21,720
question of how do you create safe

1163
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:24,260
spaces so I'd appreciate light minute I

1164
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:27,839
work in a company based in Russia and

1165
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:30,420
Russia has a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> law about making</font>

1166
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it illegal to promote homosexuality or</font>

1167
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:38,880
non-traditional families our<font color="#E5E5E5"> company has</font>

00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:41,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">a policy which is to ensure that you do</font>

1169
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">not discriminate against people based on</font>

1170
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:49,230
sexuality or various other questions and

1171
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:51,690
the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite clear in reminding</font>

1172
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:55,560
its employees from time to time that

1173
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:58,320
that's our policy one of the things that

1174
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:00,960
comes into the go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> nogo question is</font>

1175
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:03,360
it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a country where</font>

1176
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:06,840
it is legal to discriminate against

1177
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,220
people because they have blue eyes it's

1178
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:11,990
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different thing to go to a country</font>

1179
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it is illegal not to discriminate</font>

1180
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:17,140
against people

1181
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:23,680
so that there's an important difference

1182
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:26,830
there if what we do in at work is viewed

1183
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:31,210
as promoting non traditional family

1184
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:32,799
values they need to legal and breaking

1185
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:34,300
the law is generally regarded as<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

1186
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that companies shouldn't do</font>

1187
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:40,150
and that makes it a much more difficult

1188
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:44,530
place to go if there is a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

1189
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:48,310
the laws are in theory medieval but the

1190
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:50,050
implementation is actually one that

1191
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,840
doesn't cause problems and one that

1192
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:56,680
allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to behave in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a manner we</font>

1193
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:59,770
believe is acceptable then that's a

1194
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:01,660
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> different level of question</font>

1195
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:06,100
and a different level of controversy

1196
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:08,710
because as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last pc i leave and come</font>

1197
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:11,799
from and visit and work in<font color="#CCCCCC"> places all of</font>

1198
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:14,230
which commit horrendous human rights

1199
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,150
violations and an unfortunate let

1200
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:19,600
applies to most of the planet so it's

1201
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:21,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty hard to avoid thanks so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1202
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,779
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I know I didn't cut the queue</font>

1203
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,140
before you about in it but please make

1204
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:28,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">it brief some people can go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lunch</font>

1205
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:30,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it was a question so it will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1206
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:32,940
open question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess but you know but</font>

1207
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:35,920
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is there are a lot of</font>

1208
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:37,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">human rights treaties and so the</font>

1209
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:42,030
question is how what would be a good

1210
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:45,520
methods to understand which rights are

1211
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:48,310
relevant for this organization and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1212
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,110
methods could you suggest us for that to

1213
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:53,590
understand that better to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

1214
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:55,720
we're not cherry-picking and next<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1215
00:56:53,590 --> 00:57:00,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">is like we can perhaps look at the</font>

1216
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:02,319
participants that are here but we cannot

1217
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:05,350
really question the participants that

1218
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:08,050
are not here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1219
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:10,180
here so that also makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit harder</font>

1220
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:12,550
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then finally it's a question about</font>

1221
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:15,640
attribution so you talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gamma</font>

1222
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:19,660
and cybersecurity but the IETF produced

1223
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:23,589
open voluntary standards so the IETF is

1224
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:25,629
not the protocol police so how how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

1225
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:27,500
that relate and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can they are</font>

1226
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:30,710
responsibilities be taking up there

1227
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:34,600
I would be very interested PSM super

1228
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:34,600
brief responses in will call today i

1229
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:45,200
think most of what you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1230
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:48,140
statements um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just very quickly I</font>

1231
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:51,049
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your meeting venue</font>

1232
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:53,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision-making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a total chaotic</font>

1233
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:56,690
spontaneous process you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

1234
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:59,960
criteria and I think that what you're

1235
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:01,940
doing is to codify those criteria so the

1236
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is what else or what</font>

1237
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,170
differently how differently you would

1238
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:08,270
like to do that in a conscious way as

1239
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:10,220
opposed to subconscious way and I see

1240
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:12,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that happening and so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1241
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:19,490
input into your process there's no a

1242
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:23,060
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer um so um you are not an</font>

1243
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:27,669
LGBTI advocacy organization right you

1244
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:30,400
have an inclusiveness a value as<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1245
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:33,620
part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expression of who you are</font>

1246
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,270
but you're not on LGBTI organization you

1247
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:37,100
could say that okay this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1248
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:40,430
that's nice to have but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not central</font>

1249
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:42,020
to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision-making process but as an</font>

1250
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:44,930
organization we will look at some other

1251
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:47,180
criteria for a meeting decision and I

1252
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:49,490
think that's perfectly fine but you

1253
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,470
still need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address your members your</font>

1254
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:53,629
participants concerns about well how are

1255
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:56,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">we going to deal with that and so I</font>

1256
00:58:53,630 --> 00:59:00,470
think that again there's no necessarily

1257
00:58:56,330 --> 00:59:02,720
a black or white way forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

1258
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:04,370
this is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with socializing at</font>

1259
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,160
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular topic inside your</font>

1260
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:09,049
organization finally news I'm not going

1261
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:11,779
to answer all of your questions but just

1262
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:13,760
to to say how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid cherry-picking</font>

1263
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:17,030
how do we how do you know you have the

1264
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,730
comprehensive set of Rights that that

1265
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:21,560
you need to address you could go<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1266
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:23,390
it that way now you could have a very

1267
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">thorough analysis of the legal</font>

1268
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:28,790
instruments and a very thorough analysis

1269
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:30,230
of your impacts and marry the two and

1270
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:32,600
come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a strategy that's that's</font>

1271
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:34,730
one thing one way of doing this you

1272
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,470
could say we're gonna pick on this

1273
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:38,210
particular right because everybody

1274
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:40,890
agrees that this is something that we

1275
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:43,410
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on say right to privacy</font>

1276
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:45,480
and was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to to really really</font>

1277
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:47,069
really get down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basics and to</font>

1278
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,380
figure out what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to our</font>

1279
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:52,740
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> right this is another way</font>

1280
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:55,560
of figuring out your human rights

1281
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:57,330
strategy so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it's just you</font>

1282
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most thorough academic</font>

1283
00:59:57,330 --> 01:00:05,430
comprehensive approach is necessarily

1284
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:07,620
your answer thanks thanks just to add to

1285
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:10,319
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus points were all</font>

1286
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:11,670
very good and very clear to just answer

1287
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,740
question terms of how to get an

1288
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:15,450
understanding of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights issues</font>

1289
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,740
take a different role different places i

1290
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:18,660
would say there are different

1291
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,250
assessments on going by different

1292
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:23,129
organizations such as human rights white

1293
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:24,990
such as freedom house that look at

1294
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:28,080
different situations different countries

1295
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:31,410
to give the proper situation sketch of

1296
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:32,520
the current concerns on human rights so

1297
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:34,319
that is maybe something to keep in mind

1298
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe very practically as to the</font>

1299
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,530
question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to catch input from</font>

1300
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:41,580
people who are not present in the room

1301
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:43,680
as to what concerns they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i</font>

1302
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,900
would amplify what we talked about

1303
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:48,990
earlier about bowling survey

1304
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,810
participants on line three different

1305
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:53,310
means get just some sort of input about

1306
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:56,549
generally what kind of factors are at

1307
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:59,009
play for you that would enable or hinder

1308
01:00:56,550 --> 01:01:00,780
your participation in in-person meetings

1309
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:02,690
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that those pieces</font>

1310
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:05,190
information can be very valuable and

1311
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:07,440
mapping dissolve easily the concerns of
