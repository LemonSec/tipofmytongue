1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,670
so maybe an oral cancer an ink pen ink

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:18,779
to the amenities and then people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:22,170
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alerts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok yeah and also</font>

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,570
remand you to sign their<font color="#E5E5E5"> policies so</font>

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,930
firstly it's the milestone check company

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:34,110
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are done with the cozy message</font>

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:36,629
specification and we have milestone to

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,820
submit constraint appropriate a gruesome

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:43,770
as a work item so this one is still

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:47,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">pending so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss to Edgar some two</font>

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:51,510
additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm draft this time and</font>

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,660
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cosine message draft we plan to</font>

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,710
submit to ISD for publication I think

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite assume because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently we are we</font>

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,640
will have already finished working

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,940
elastic or so we are quite close to that

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,060
milestone and the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one left is about</font>

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:14,400
the algorithm draft so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussed that</font>

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:22,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this meeting ok so let's move to the</font>

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:26,130
coast a message draft and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim and this</font>

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,500
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> hannahs um on just a question on I</font>

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,710
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering like from a status point</font>

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,329
of view under an<font color="#E5E5E5"> message document uh</font>

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,100
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the working class called I</font>

25
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't do many reviews everyone was</font>

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,679
fairly busy I didn't do my ribollita

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,179
because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also busy but I was</font>

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,240
actually at that time sort of looking

29
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">around for implementations and and</font>

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,759
working with some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys in a stew</font>

31
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:54,990
to look at implementation activities and

32
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:57,210
um specifically for<font color="#E5E5E5"> IUD devices and that</font>

33
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,280
they are things are still and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a very</font>

34
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,899
early stage so I wound up um well it

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,810
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to move push forward and and</font>

36
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,030
finalize it or sort of wait a little bit

37
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,130
to get at least some implementation

38
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,020
feedback I know Jim you have implement

39
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:16,620
an implementation but it's it's written

40
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,100
for high end systems like it like some

41
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,660
of the students I look

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,210
I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like who had looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,040
code is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Rama locations for 64</font>

44
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,210
kilobytes and then this type of it like

45
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,769
this type of thing so um but I don't

46
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,240
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if what's the what's your ambition</font>

47
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:38,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">level are so how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long do you expect to</font>

48
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,540
wait if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait well I'm I'm</font>

49
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:46,720
curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> and unlike how are we doing</font>

50
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:49,090
implementation wise like I know that

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,230
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this I'm the student from look</font>

52
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:58,240
like from your group who had worked on

53
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:00,660
implementation and she had that but but

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:06,340
besides that I'm not shown on any

55
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:10,269
embedded implementation recommend on

56
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:14,080
that I indeed had two students work on

57
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:20,230
based on James C code and they made like

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:22,900
a messy dirty alpha and to get done with

59
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,850
the master<font color="#CCCCCC"> thesis and we have hired one</font>

60
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,560
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to turn this messy</font>

61
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:32,620
dirty alpha into something usable now so

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:37,920
you will start in September<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am hoping</font>

63
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:42,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have something for ITF 97 in November</font>

64
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,700
I'll keep you updated I don't know about

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,710
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else but we definitely need some</font>

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,450
implementations on this because

67
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">otherwise like that was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

68
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">showstopper in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the student</font>

69
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,620
project that I reported about in the age

70
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,390
group because there was obviously no

71
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,550
cosi implementation of a lever that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

72
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:05,829
could use they had to fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do on</font>

73
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:10,410
this under Jose stuff and they use the

74
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,410
chase<font color="#CCCCCC"> on web token for that purpose so</font>

75
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,230
like it's good to have specifications

76
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,000
done but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of cool if we</font>

77
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:23,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have some implementation</font>

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,570
feedback as one so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed that in Jim</font>

79
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,140
slices of Korea talk about the

80
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,260
immigration<font color="#CCCCCC"> status so maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're gonna</font>

81
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,740
just go to gyms

82
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,719
slides and then to see the status for

83
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:58,020
the humiliation of them we decide the

84
00:04:36,720 --> 00:05:01,740
next step oh ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so where do I mean it</font>

85
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,700
right now it's officially complete

86
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,850
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> request all in the process of</font>

87
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:14,090
the Shepherd's right have done their

88
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:16,920
concern old things notice most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it are</font>

89
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,320
minor things that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> none is actually</font>

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,890
effectively before specification the

91
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,890
document some of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Diana works in a bit</font>

92
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:36,840
some of it is I am that quickly some of

93
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:41,850
this an work some of it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a editorial</font>

94
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff I expect to have a version of</font>

95
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,240
the document with all of those updates

96
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:50,700
done by the time i get off play on the

97
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:57,060
way back so there should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a new</font>

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:59,280
version published next week one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

99
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:04,950
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that basically comes out at</font>

100
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,440
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point on personal injury ah it</font>

101
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,469
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful for us to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> requests I am</font>

102
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">your the allocation of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Seaboard</font>

103
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:18,660
punkin text because those values are

104
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:21,110
show up through all the implementations

105
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:26,520
and they show up as well as examples

106
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:29,370
work for the document and the later be

107
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,760
postponed<font color="#E5E5E5"> NASA more likely those numbers</font>

108
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,850
are intentionally leaked into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

109
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,940
and also the more work is going to be to

110
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,470
actually do that operated<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a point so</font>

111
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,670
it's quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible that we can talk</font>

112
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get in early set</font>

113

allocations for that that's the city

114
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:55,970
registry we are defining a substantial

115
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,510
number of registries in this document

116
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,830
and they are also that for expert review

117
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,560
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements of the working</font>

candidates designated experts for doing

121
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,810
that expert review if people have any

130
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,440
worried about buying a new pin it and I

before I'd worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else I</font>

135
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:00,990
mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first problem I have if I say I</font>

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:05,250
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do an IOT implementation with</font>

137
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:09,200
this is I start asking a question and

138
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:13,950
say so did we have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / dreary</font>

139
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,750
the answer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really um there's been</font>

140
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,440
half a dozen of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in becoming</font>

141
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:23,970
different flavors and none of it seemed

142
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,790
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very general purpose useful but if</font>

143
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:31,920
you got one like to use please let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:32,970
know well um this is honey uh so of

145
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,280
course there are different libraries

146
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,920
like there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the singer crypto</font>

147
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,169
library for on the desktop<font color="#E5E5E5"> world or</font>

148
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,299
smartphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> work either so but there are</font>

149
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">at least a few candidates other people</font>

150
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:48,420
can can take a look at um so of course

151
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:51,600
we have a preference for our library um

152
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,449
which is part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mpls code which is</font>

153
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,620
crypto library there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure there</font>

154
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:00,820
others as well but the

155
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:04,480
so when I don't that my gosh is I can't

156
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:07,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember if you see is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

157
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the current</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> color poly stuff is wrong</font>

158
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:15,310
what we need is for a DAT as opposed to

159
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:18,100
go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> class um but that's sort of yeah</font>

160
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:21,099
the bully stuff is fairly new the GTM

161
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,790
support is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iud site we</font>

162
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,980
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use CCM that's what we be yeah</font>

163
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,980
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would be used everywhere</font>

164
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:35,800
like what we recommend to use like in in

165
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:37,540
core in the dice profile etc um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

166
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,540
would have to check the status on on

167
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,040
some of the newer things but they are a

168
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,069
little bit more experimental definitely

169
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,750
yeah but that maybe there are other

170
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,490
ideas what other libraries people want

171
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,980
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use so maybe you can create a shim on</font>

172
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,600
top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to make that to hide some of</font>

173
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,580
the details of the specifics of the

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,290
library but that's at least Luke leak

175
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,870
had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the imperialists our</font>

the current content type of coding which

<font color="#E5E5E5">get to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BBBS a algorithms to work on</font>

my impatient so I can produce examples

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:50,080
of him those and then a process<font color="#CCCCCC"> decking</font>

de BES a document for chrg i also got

d300s use the

00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:27,000
nothing she's working off<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now that</font>

193
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:30,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds better um there are examples um</font>

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,010
any missing examples things i should put

195
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,080
up there that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful once we</font>

196
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,480
get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cwts back i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should</font>

197
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably put some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cwt examples up there</font>

198
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,070
there may be other examples that we

199
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,880
should put up there I don't know whether

200
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:50,670
it makes sense to do some examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

201
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,460
are wrapped in core as part of the

202
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:58,079
processing or not but anything from that

203
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,760
is useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> planning to try to do</font>

204
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,340
some focusing for at least the next

205
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:07,620
three meetings in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code super in is</font>

206
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:10,740
in the hackathon for both cozy and Jose

207
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,280
work so anybody who has<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

208
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,270
implementations anyone who has

209
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,750
applications that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what I want</font>

210
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:21,390
to use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone who has specific</font>

211
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:25,400
environments they want to implement for

212
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:28,050
on anything I can do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help on that and</font>

213
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,860
in to interrupt st and help the

214
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,800
development work do some develop myself

215
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:37,080
let me know what sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

216
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:41,490
think would be useful so we can do some

217
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:43,890
some focused work at the the code sprint

218
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:50,030
ethic at the hackathons out the coach

219
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:50,030
Brent on this on any of this stuff I

220
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:56,450
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it yeah</font>

221
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:12,189
okay Mike Mike Jones it in response to

222
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:14,740
Jim's hackathon comment one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

223
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:18,940
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know Jose implementers</font>

224
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:21,580
have found extraordinarily useful is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

225
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:26,110
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc that Matt Miller did which</font>

226
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:29,230
is 7520 that contains comprehensive

227
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:34,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine readable examples of uses of</font>

228
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:37,300
every algorithm that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined I don't</font>

229
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,790
know if that's something that you're

230
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,410
interested in doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the scope of what</font>

231
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:48,099
you described your somebody else wants

232
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:51,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take that on the question from my</font>

233
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:55,660
point of view is is that more worthwhile

234
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:57,790
having as a paper document or more

235
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,969
worthwhile as having potentially a paper

236
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:03,959
document which describes how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the</font>

237
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:07,530
github repository in that way because

238
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:10,960
the github repository if you look at it

239
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:13,930
basically has each each example has this

240
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,780
exact same set of information as was in

241
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,520
in that paper and in that paper RFC so

242
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,860
it's got this is the input this is the

243
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,180
key this is the cek you're going to

244
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,950
calculate this is the key agreement

245
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,420
you're going to calculate this is what

246
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,240
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the you know</font>

247
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the HK DF statement so everything is is</font>

248
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,430
is in that example so it's and it's

249
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:37,180
that's a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more machine readable than</font>

250
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:41,260
what is the the paper Oh completely

251
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,910
agreed I'm just thinking out loud as

252
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,819
part of my working group last call

253
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:49,120
review I didn't ask the question in my

254
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:52,240
head do the examples in the current

255
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,520
messages doc cover all the algorithms I

256
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,520
know the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no not they do not</font>

257
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:03,190
all right we can continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> this later but</font>

258
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,910
that was my thinking for a hackathon

259
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,910
project

260
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,130
ok so my summary for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the message of</font>

261
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,969
allah<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we need more reviews</font>

262
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:20,529
because hannah said there are some

263
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:22,060
vacation time and people didn't look at

264
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:25,899
that and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough reviews</font>

265
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:30,729
and also we need to go two more examples

266
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:36,459
and more implications so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next step</font>

267
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:38,589
is that Jim<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now get more reviews and</font>

268
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:53,160
then we can add some examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

269
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:56,320
we submit for publication<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay 10 9 I</font>

270
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,880
I'll be honest I mean I can we can spit

271
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,329
out the list to give me more to give

272
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:04,389
more reviews but I mean basically this

273
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:08,199
document has been more<font color="#CCCCCC"> or less fixed</font>

274
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:10,510
since the first of May southern middle

275
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:13,719
my idea was is when last time<font color="#CCCCCC"> was and</font>

276
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:15,459
when we said essentially you know we're

277
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,569
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have two weeks of review and</font>

278
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:20,399
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have two weeks of last</font>

279
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:25,120
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've had four weeks since then</font>

280
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,949
do we really think that that honest is

281
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,360
going to manage to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a review</font>

282
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:33,010
between now and six months from<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so I</font>

283
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick on you particularly</font>

284
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:44,380
hummus no you do um like look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

285
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:47,889
number of people who had posted working

286
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:50,639
class called comments like who it's this

287
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:53,620
should be somewhat really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

288
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,990
so like we worked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> aids we tried to</font>

289
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,250
reach out for things around<font color="#CCCCCC"> cozied sort</font>

290
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,779
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expectation that lots of people</font>

291
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,910
are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it because they were</font>

292
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,250
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm concerned about the size</font>

293
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:07,119
limitation of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chase on payloads</font>

294
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:10,869
and we had lots of interactions earlier

295
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,909
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document um so I spend my time on</font>

296
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,250
unlike fine running out on the on the

297
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,679
implementation side because because

298
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,929
terrasen also a is trying to put sort of

299
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,470
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cozy into internet context</font>

300
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:23,470
what

301
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,240
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's fine like move ahead I</font>

302
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,939
would provide my comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

303
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,700
provide review comments if I have them

304
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:33,700
in in IDF last call I can also do that

305
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,710
but I was also encourage others to look

306
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,390
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because otherwise you may end up</font>

307
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,220
having that something there's some some

308
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,309
things in it that we may or may not like

309
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,650
yeah I mean I'm certainly I've had five

310
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:47,559
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> six people that I've request should</font>

311
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,720
read the document yeah like for example

312
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:51,340
in oh us I'm like we publish things were

313
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,669
there are lots of tons of implementation

314
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,199
before that we don't move move<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead you</font>

315
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:58,330
know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at dls people do a</font>

316
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of hacking and now here somehow we</font>

317
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:06,460
we a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of relaxed i don't know</font>

318
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:09,340
i don't understand why exactly but so

319
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,250
it's from<font color="#CCCCCC"> justin we had a two-week</font>

320
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:15,039
pre-review and had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-week working</font>

321
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:20,470
working group last call we all have had

322
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:23,230
time as a chair kathleen marie already

323
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,480
um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in and honest agreed</font>

324
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,940
with this he can review in IETF last

325
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,120
call a document can always get sent back

326
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:35,049
to a previous stage so if something

327
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes up in IETF last call even in iesg</font>

328
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:38,408
review we can kick it back to the

329
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,750
working group right so if something

330
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:43,000
substantial comes up it gets those

331
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:48,580
substantial comments go back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

332
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,320
group for for comment now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say</font>

333
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,139
you know we shouldn't start it for at

334
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,710
least another week given that a lot of

335
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,539
people take next week off well I guess

336
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:07,480
maybe maybe a these who are exhausted

337
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:10,919
take next week off market day off she's

338
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,919
not a week<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we'll see</font>

339
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:27,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we will give more time for the</font>

340
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:31,730
people to review under them moving

341
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:47,340
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and next one it's</font>

342
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:50,280
additional algorithms<font color="#CCCCCC"> um okay too okay</font>

343
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,280
um there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some algorithms which are</font>

344
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:57,149
not in the base document and some people

345
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,450
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> said we want to add these</font>

346
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:04,140
algorithms because they're popular in

347
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:06,920
some respect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest to that come up</font>

348
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:15,660
are the biggest three that come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

349
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:18,510
RSA PSS RSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> oap and RSA v 1.5 arm others</font>

350
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:23,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would never be in favor of putting in</font>

351
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:26,970
1.5 for all sorts of security<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

352
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:30,720
actually have a draft out there that

353
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:34,230
draft was basically produced by taking

354
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,510
the the the full draft cutting down

355
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,460
sections that that obviously didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

356
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:42,990
nothing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with adding algorithms arm</font>

357
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,510
and it was never really designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

358
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:49,020
draft for people to read it was more a

359
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:52,890
draft of this is is where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am on things</font>

360
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:56,040
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I pulled don't want to lose so it's</font>

361
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:58,860
got a whole slew of crawfish in it it's

362
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,320
got believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still got the EDD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SI</font>

363
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,870
stuff in it which obviously has been

364
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,179
full pull forward in the main document

365
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:09,060
it doesn't have any new things<font color="#CCCCCC"> for doing</font>

366
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:14,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">ki rafts for doing ki agreements any of</font>

367
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:16,440
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff um but there is some</font>

368
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:20,670
interest in potentially from people to

369
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,400
include that and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward on the other</font>

370
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:26,820
one that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have expression</font>

371
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,720
interested in is there's a couple places

372
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,418
where people

373
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,940
have asked us to potentially include

374
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:34,950
hash algorithms as independent objects

375
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,780
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm table so they can do</font>

376
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,590
some negotiations dealing with hash

377
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:43,610
algorithms or where they can do some

378
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:47,730
specific interesting types of payloads

379
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:49,889
so that they can do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

380
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this file and this is a hash of the</font>

381
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">file this so in order to do say this is</font>

382
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> house the file you need to identify</font>

383
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:59,340
the hash for that purpose it might be

384
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:01,679
useful to actually include hashes in the

385
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,600
end the standard algorithm table because

386
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,880
then you could do either a hash or an H

387
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:11,280
Mac or whatever depending on what it is

388
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:15,900
you're playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with next slide um if we</font>

389
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,760
do decide to include more algorithms I'd

390
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,610
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually try to figure out how</font>

391
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:25,140
to apply some criteria for selection of

392
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,178
what we use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we don't use um my</font>

393
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,210
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cozy is still primarily</font>

394
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:32,970
focused at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT world if there are</font>

395
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:36,960
people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in to use cozy in</font>

396
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:39,590
a non IOT world space that may make some

397
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,770
difference in how we do some selections

398
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:47,340
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now as you know my primary</font>

399
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:54,059
idea is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is IOT not is you know</font>

400
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:56,520
internet so one of the questions is do

401
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:59,490
we expect the IT world to adopt these

402
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,980
algorithms I kind of have a hard time

403
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,929
believing the IOT world is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

404
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,799
all of that interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in doing RSA in</font>

405
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:09,990
general I mean they're taught you know

406
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:17,150
you're basically a saying if I go from

407
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:20,909
the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIST p25 to 256 curve to an</font>

408
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:24,510
RSA key of about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same security</font>

409
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:26,990
levels you're adding almost 200 bytes to

410
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:31,740
your message<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that additional</font>

411
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:33,270
bytes of signature that's kind of the IT

412
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,820
people were coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and screaming</font>

413
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,789
can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get rid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this one bite here can</font>

414
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,809
we get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes here I</font>

415
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:41,520
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're going to be all of</font>

416
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:43,950
that interested in saying oh

417
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:49,379
oh yeah we can take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 192</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes no</font>

418
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:50,850
problem so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear that the</font>

419
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">summit from that point of view some of</font>

420
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,860
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are interesting in terms of the v</font>

421
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,200
1.5 question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean what sort of</font>

422
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,179
security analysis what sort of proves

423
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,550
what sort of implementations do we want

424
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,410
on these things before we adopt them I

425
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:07,860
think we may actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

426
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more rigorous about what we</font>

427
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:14,850
let into the to the world then then we

428
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:21,149
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some cases where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is you know a</font>

429
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:24,060
bit more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a free-for-all so yeah so at</font>

430
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:27,420
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is like I did you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font>

431
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:30,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">next question is slide right at one more</font>

432
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:33,030
time yeah you hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so at this</font>

433
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,070
point it's like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a couple of</font>

434
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:37,290
different questions in my mind in terms

435
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:40,530
of an additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm the document</font>

436
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:43,470
the first is do we want to wait a bit

437
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:46,020
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we publish an additional</font>

438
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,970
algorithm document just to see give

439
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,700
people some implementation experience

440
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:54,090
some real-world experiments so we can

441
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,530
say oh well we didn't miss just this one

442
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,840
thing we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have missed me missed</font>

443
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,090
these three four five things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

444
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">really should have talked about because</font>

445
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the source of things we're</font>

446
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:11,730
really looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at I mean there is is is</font>

447
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:16,159
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed hoc thing which was discussed in</font>

448
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:21,480
ace earlier and it may be that that

449
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:23,940
might actually be better cast as a four

450
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,360
key diffie-hellman thing when you do the

451
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,740
final key derivation step um I don't

452
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">know whether that whether it would or</font>

453
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,930
wouldn't but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case that would you</font>

454
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,450
know that's that's a larger algorithm

455
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:39,000
change then you know something quite

456
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,230
this simple as saying oh we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need our</font>

457
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,570
essay but that's the sort of thing we

458
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,340
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know until we get farther into</font>

459
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,530
looking at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these algorithm at</font>

460
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,820
these applications that people are going

461
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:52,500
to use um there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

462
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,780
different approaches we could use with

463
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,380
this doc document in terms of publishing

464
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,180
it

465
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,970
we could actually keep the cozy working

466
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,790
group open let it go to sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> for now</font>

467
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,980
six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months a year oh and and have a</font>

468
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:08,730
meeting and say yes we have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

469
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:11,340
want to do now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could dump this work</font>

470
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:14,520
for additional algorithms<font color="#CCCCCC"> into curdle we</font>

471
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,379
could basically say you either need to

472
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,840
reach harder you need to justify an

473
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,210
independent submission or an individual

474
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,649
submission to add these algorithms at a

475
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:30,750
later date when we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

476
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:32,850
we're doing yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> green so here um I have</font>

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,280
additional use casing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> coast is</font>

fields I need known says go back and

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:47,610
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> and some other stuff so in my</font>

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,690
but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like this I</font>

485
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,260
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how the later you can extend</font>

486
00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:05,670
I don't know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should look at and</font>

487
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:10,710
send the comments i use kasi to

00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:13,800
transport key establishment to do a key

the AKA in<font color="#CCCCCC"> cosy object that is very</font>

495
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:40,710
useful for my purpose but not exactly

496
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:42,870
but is it similar to that yeah if any

497
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,640
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like to sit down and talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

498
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,810
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be interested</font>

499
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,090
simply just in terms of avenues cases

500
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:53,310
adding stuff like that adding you know

501
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,830
things which go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to the header</font>

502
00:27:53,310 --> 00:28:00,060
parameters adding new algorithms is a

503
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:02,100
relatively easy process in terms of you

504
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:05,700
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a specification you need</font>

505
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:09,059
to get it registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> diana and you need</font>

506
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,850
to have an expert<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in part of the</font>

507
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:13,710
diana is there will be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> designated</font>

508
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,908
expert<font color="#E5E5E5"> who will look at it and say this</font>

509
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,990
makes sense this doesn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense so</font>

510
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:21,799
adding these sorts of things at a later

511
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:26,940
date is not really all that difficult

512
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:29,429
with you know yeah from seeing Donald

513
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,129
just an open Christian to participant

514
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:34,590
Jim mention that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work creates a</font>

515
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:37,699
large number of registries or summaries

516
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:42,418
race does anyone view that as a problem

517
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:44,490
namely requires too much management yes

518
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:48,029
it means<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol has smaller</font>

519
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:50,730
encodings but at least at the fat end on

520
00:28:48,029 --> 00:29:00,990
incrementation needs big table to other

521
00:28:50,730 --> 00:29:03,990
identify as bi team can't answer for

522
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,389
other people personally I'd say no<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

523
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:16,019
management is going to end up on this is

524
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:18,508
very small so for the closest on this

525
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:21,960
slide so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the end</font>

526
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:23,789
and because we have another presentation

527
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,929
from Mac so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a feedback</font>

528
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:34,169
about this slide so basically we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

529
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:36,509
several questions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> any feedback no I</font>

530
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:39,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I think the questions for</font>

531
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:44,009
discussion right yeah the question for

532
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">discontinued</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if if if anyone has</font>

533
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:49,139
comments relative to any of the

534
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:51,210
questions I've got here speak up now

535
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:53,459
it'd be really nice for us to have a not

536
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:58,080
to give information into where we're

537
00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:02,820
headed but this is Ludwick comment on

538
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:05,759
the question from Sean actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

539
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:10,320
every implementation will need all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

540
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:12,720
the entries in the registry so for the

541
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,029
individual ndv implementation they won't

542
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,019
be a problem they will have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> table with</font>

543
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:22,800
the few registry entries they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

544
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:25,850
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that managing the registries going</font>

545
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:34,470
to be a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more tricky but then again</font>

546
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:38,850
do we have a good alternative custom

547
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:42,260
woman cosi has been designed for the

548
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:46,230
Internet of Things now the question that

549
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:48,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes up is does that mean that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

550
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:51,390
exchanges that will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> supported by cosi</font>

551
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:55,260
where we become between constraint nodes

552
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:58,260
and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the current or</font>

553
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Space Ace architecture we have less</font>

554
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,420
constrained clients and authorization

555
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:07,560
servers they talk to each other and they

556
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:10,200
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> using RSA they probably will be</font>

557
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:14,970
using certificates that contain RSA in

558
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:18,000
them so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's important that</font>

559
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:20,340
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a suite of evidence we</font>

560
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,160
can use between constraint systems but

561
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,169
we may not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to switch to may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

562
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,600
want to have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch to a different</font>

563
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,640
representation just because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives</font>

564
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:38,310
us and a few additional evidence that we

00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:42,810
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it at a cosy level Mike Jones</font>

566
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">microsoft and one thing that we put into</font>

567
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:50,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">jose as you may remember which i think</font>

00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:53,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">was at Shawn Turner suggestion was in</font>

569
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,950
the registry for algorithms we included

570
00:31:53,400 --> 00:32:00,210
a field called algorithm analysis

571
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:02,970
documents which was a set of references

572
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:05,370

579
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:35,390
we could easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> add that for</font>

580
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:37,970
cozy as well as part of the criteria the

581
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:40,100
the designated experts would use yeah I

582
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:42,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean adding that as part of the template</font>

583
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,899
is it's i mean that's actually not a

584
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,159
column in is it's in the registration

587
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:03,790
put on no feedback then we move to Mike

588
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,790
slides under then we come back

589
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:33,240
i'm mike jones from microsoft and i'm

590
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:37,470
here to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a moment about an</font>

591
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:43,830
individual submission draft on using the

00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:51,510
RSA algorithms with cozy so the spec<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

593
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:54,120
wrote in the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of april defines</font>

594
00:33:51,510 --> 00:34:00,120

00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:07,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">oap and like the draft that Jim just</font>

597
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:12,389
described this pulse text directly out

598
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:15,210
of the cozy messages draft 05 which is

599
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:18,780
the last one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> still contained these</font>

600
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:35,909
algorithms<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I'm about to answer</font>

601
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:39,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">your question next so that the question</font>

602
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:41,700
is why do both of these exist and the

603
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:45,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">history from at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least my point of view</font>

604
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:47,299
was a quirk of timing in issue 21 I

605
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:51,779
volunteered<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write the draft in</font>

606
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:55,200
December<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know time passed I went on</font>

607
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:58,290
vacation in March gym rat a draft in

608
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,480
March I was good and stayed offline

609
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,640
during vacation and didn't notice and

610
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,500
said one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first things I did when</font>

611
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,009
I got back<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vacation was I wrote a</font>

612
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:11,609
draft which unsurprisingly in fact I did

613
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:15,840
a a diff of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a real line by line</font>

614
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:17,609
diff and the stuff about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the RSA</font>

615
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,700
algorithms is essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

616
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:27,630
because it came<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the same source</font>

617
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:31,799
material next so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is different mine</font>

618
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:33,540
has RSA Jim also has ed DSA otherwise

619
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,100
you just pointed out that's actually in

620
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,290
the core messages

621
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:40,950
draft again so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be deleted</font>

622
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:46,110
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jim's anyway so that only leaves</font>

623
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:48,180
one salient difference right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

624
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,880
is that mine kept the numeric

625
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:53,460
assignments for the different

626
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:58,440
identifiers and gems just<font color="#E5E5E5"> says TBD right</font>

627
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:00,480
now Kathleen Kathleen Moriarty um I'm

628
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,740
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> why you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going through it in</font>

629
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,170
this way because Jim's draft has adopted

630
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:14,220
yours is not so if you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

631
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:16,740
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that really no okay all right</font>

632
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:21,839
sorry i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> confused on that then i was</font>

633
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:23,490
writing a draft to fill a need because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

634
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,730
thought Jim wasn't going to do it but

635
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:29,129
Jim did it so wait I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've got</font>

636
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,800
several good choices I'll only be a

637
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:33,060
couple more minutes okay and it's

638
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,820
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just how you're framing the</font>

639
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,560
questions mine this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as opposed to</font>

640
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:41,100
this dress does this this that dress is

641
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:44,279
that yep those<font color="#CCCCCC"> four short hands to make</font>

642
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:52,380
the lines short rather than draft shod

643
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:55,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft Jones etc next actually given</font>

644
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:58,110
that EDD<font color="#CCCCCC"> essay is in the main document</font>

645
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,340
now which I didn't realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I wrote</font>

646
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:07,860
these slides we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just skip this</font>

647
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:11,010
next so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my last slide we should</font>

648
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:14,070
clearly resolve the duplication I think

649
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:18,090
we've got two good paths that we could

650
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:23,370
choose from one is we could adopt Jim's

651
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:26,910
draft and make decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about whether</font>

652
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:30,810
to include additional algorithms or just

653
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:35,370
to leave Jim's at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RSA algorithms and</font>

654
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:37,350
publish it soon or you could adopt the

655
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:39,180
equivalent of my draft and I don't care

656
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot whether I'm an editor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jims and</font>

657
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:46,580
editor or gemini<font color="#CCCCCC"> or co-editors and get</font>

658
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,620
the RSA stuff out now

659
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:53,279
my preference for a moment wearing my

660
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:56,819
Microsoft hat is that we do plan to use

661
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">RSA algorithms with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cozy in some use</font>

662
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:03,630
cases including some distributed ledger

663
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:08,430
related stuff is a possibility so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

664
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:11,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">OT stuff we would like the RSA algorithm</font>

665
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:15,419
identifiers assigned hopefully at the

666
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:19,610
same time as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core cozy messages</font>

667
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:21,720
draft is adopted and so in that sense

668
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:25,620
ignoring<font color="#CCCCCC"> his the editor which I don't</font>

669
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a big stake in I would like an RSA</font>

670
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:33,720
only algorithms draft done and adopted

671
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,410
soon I would be open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other algorithms</font>

672
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,390
being also<font color="#CCCCCC"> put into that draft that are</font>

673
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:42,569
mature<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're not going to block on</font>

674
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:45,690
the approval of another RFC in order to

675
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:48,090
get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing approved I'm fine</font>

676
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:51,260
obviously with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

677
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:54,600
deciding later to adopt other algorithms

678
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,610
possibly in Jim's draft so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

679
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,069
it's you know chairs and Kathleen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

680
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:01,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">working group to figure out what we want</font>

681
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:05,790
to do but I just want the RSA stuff done

682
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:07,500
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kathleen Moriarty it's up to the</font>

683
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group right does this happen in</font>

684
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,400
the working group so the trails will

685
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,590
leave that it's not up to me I just want

686
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">to know strongly that the work group is</font>

687
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:20,430
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this before we even</font>

688
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:25,560
worry about whose draft gets adopted um

689
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:27,240
and take it from there ah so I don't

690
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,080
know capping do you have any questions

691
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:35,520
formulated to start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure this out</font>

692
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:44,640
yeah so yeah I plan to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

693
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:49,500
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so um let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask how many</font>

694
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have read either one or both of</font>

695
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,890
the job

696
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:24,260
fine and how many people plan to

697
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:28,100
implement that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay sorry Justin</font>

698
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:31,790
said that I see a number of Christians

699
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:35,330
first Louisiana need for this work yes

700
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:47,779
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> no second if he s should it be in</font>

701
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:50,630
this working group yes so so the first

702
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:56,750
course is and policy the lead for this

703
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:59,330
work so i'm not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have enough</font>

704
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:06,370
information do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 the onion</font>

705
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:06,370
discussing what we will just the harm ah

706
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,310
the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> raised their hand and</font>

707
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,860
said they were going to implement are

708
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,660
you guys all implementing the same

709
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:31,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem or are you implementing</font>

710
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:34,670
different problems I don't entirely

711
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:36,920
understand what are you implementing the

712
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:42,320
same exact same protocol that Microsoft

713
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:44,930
is should you have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so</font>

714
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,640
okay so you're going to implement it but

715
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,960
you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you're saying you're</font>

716
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,279
going to implement it but you don't have

717
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:57,980
an immediate need for it whether or not

718
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:59,890
are you there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me but it might</font>

719
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,319
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

720
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:06,670
so high the other people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise their</font>

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:10,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the remote people John Bradley</font>

722
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:12,549
said that ping is not discussed with

723
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,190
Microsoft whether their need for the

724
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:28,750
algorithms is the same as Microsoft's

725
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:30,880
need for the algorithms<font color="#E5E5E5"> three okay Tony</font>

726
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:32,799
nedelin microsoft also but<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different</font>

727
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,440
we have different use cases within

728
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:37,829
Microsoft so Mike mentioned one

729
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:43,769
particular use case we also have an

730
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:46,510
implementation for w3c which is the

731
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:49,359
which will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web web authentication</font>

732
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:54,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">api's that will use this particular</font>

733
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:57,549
pattern<font color="#CCCCCC"> also so that's true web often is</font>

734
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:59,559
using because he signed messages and RSA

735
00:42:57,549 --> 00:43:07,029
is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm sets so there's</font>

736
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:10,299
a w3c dependency on this yes for some of

737
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:13,329
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-level message formats when</font>

738
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:18,220
talking to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> phyto calls</font>

739
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:20,200
authenticators that's correct so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

740
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,029
also like to know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people are</font>

741
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,460
interested but don't have enough

742
00:43:22,029 --> 00:43:27,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">information yet and plan to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> read the</font>

743
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:35,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">drafts right so can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we even take these</font>

744
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:38,289
polls now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's a few more</font>

745
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:42,819
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are interested so maybe</font>

746
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:45,400
there were four more and i'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

747
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:51,308
a few because we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be exact</font>

748
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:53,019
on numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this probably</font>

749
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:56,650
has to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the list we probably can't</font>

750
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:59,200
decide it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

751
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:01,809
there's enough information and only five

752
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,669
people are ready to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> an opinion and</font>

753
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:07,059
for more want to have an informed

754
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:10,720
opinion so maybe can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a timeline</font>

755
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:13,289
on this from the chairs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then put it</font>

756
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,288
out to the list

757
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:23,828
okay I mean giving you know give it like

758
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:26,470
a several week poll and for me you can

759
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:28,299
formulate the questions now you could

760
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:30,399
try to ask it now but then open it up to

761
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:32,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list so that yeah yeah there's a lot</font>

762
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:37,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that aren't ready your answer</font>

763
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:40,329
maybe there's some more I hope yeah just

764
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:42,569
since it that the chairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a</font>

765
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:45,190
Christian to the list in a week a

766
00:44:42,569 --> 00:44:48,490
Christian sorry the chairs will takes a

767
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:52,930
question to the list in a week it's a

768
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:55,598
poll run for two weeks from Justin okay

769
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:59,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but now I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut some rough</font>

770
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:06,549
idea and from the room so do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see the</font>

771
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:19,059
need for this work so if you are in

772
00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:21,759
favor of this work please<font color="#CCCCCC"> hum na okay if</font>

773
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see the need for this work</font>

774
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:40,809
please come now if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

775
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:44,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">information please come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now so Alice</font>

776
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:46,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">understood your harm for or don't have</font>

777
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:52,299
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and don't see the</font>

778
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:53,319
need I didn't come for the so I'm for

779
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:55,210
that I don't have enough information

780
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:57,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I I don't know what the other</font>

781
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:01,180
use cases are that people come forward I

782
00:45:57,069 --> 00:46:04,660
haven't so I I our use case for cozies

783
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:06,339
is focused on the IOT case so the RSA I

784
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,960
Persians played don't play<font color="#E5E5E5"> the road</font>

785
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:13,000
there but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask i'm inside</font>

786
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,740
the company to see whether there's some

787
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,049
other use cases that people envisioning

788
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,578
in and so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the</font>

789
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:21,400
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> way as some of the other guys who</font>

790
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:25,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">raise their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hands previously so I was</font>

791
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone else hum for the no need for the</font>

792
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:30,109
work

793
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:34,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok let's go question the use case we</font>

794
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:37,730
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is the elegant for you so I</font>

795
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:43,100
in there um that that got me to think

796
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:48,290
but I believe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case where if</font>

797
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:50,089
easy if we create the object at the

798
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:52,670
server site that authorization server

799
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:56,270
and then pass it on they can be verified

800
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:59,140
at the resource server site which would

801
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:01,220
be then an IOT device most likely or

802
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:04,700
ultimately at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the again at the</font>

803
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:06,529
authorization server and they are if you

804
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:09,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">have one algorithm love why would you</font>

805
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:11,060
want to pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> large objects around even</font>

806
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">if they are not potentially not very</font>

807
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:19,009
less constrained even if it's also

808
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:21,200
explaining your scenario again<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

809
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:25,190
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that in other ization servers</font>

810
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:28,520
able to actually issue a ticket<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

811
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:31,580
needs to be some form of exchange that

812
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,750
exchange is often based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> things from</font>

813
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:38,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the big web environment so it has RSA</font>

814
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,860
certificates in it and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font>

815
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,990
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of RSA going back and forth</font>

816
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,750
of course you could stipulate that

817
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:48,109
everything that users are as a awesome

818
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:50,540
must use<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1 or whatever but that</font>

819
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:52,730
complicates implementations so it would

820
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:57,050
be nice to also be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use cozy for</font>

821
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:59,930
those exchanges yeah but for those for

822
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:02,420
those exchanges like India and with what

823
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:04,310
we are defining the client which would

824
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:07,610
in NP for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mobile phone or</font>

825
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:11,270
tablet<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it wouldn't actually read</font>

826
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:13,280
those are payloads to begin with<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it</font>

827
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:18,200
wouldn't it wouldn't have to deal with

828
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,820
them well it will have to negotiate with

829
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:23,390
your authorization server to actually

830
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:24,830
issue anything if it cannot convince the

831
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:26,600
authorization server that something

832
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:28,790
should be issued then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metal web and</font>

833
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,470
that that would happen in terms of

834
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:33,890
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably comes from the</font>

835
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:36,230
big way yes but it has nothing to do

836
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:39,078
with this specific piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work so if</font>

837
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:41,150
you use RSA keys in TLS

838
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:43,640
I don't see how that relates to this

839
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:52,299
work so nothing bubbles up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this level</font>

840
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:52,299
at cosi at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cozy level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm maybe I'm</font>

841
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:59,660
so for example in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your score</font>

842
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:01,219
profile for a speaking about what what

843
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,660
kind of communication security do you

844
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:05,209
have between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client and resource</font>

845
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,618
server and what kind of security do you

846
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:09,140
have between client and authorization

847
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:12,489
server assuming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we been using</font>

848
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:15,348
application layer security in both cases

849
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:16,719
the client needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate with</font>

850
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:18,709
your throat station server and

851
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,299
potentially RSA is a better algorithm

852
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:22,729
it's a client is not constrained and

853
00:49:20,299 --> 00:49:26,209
then we are using cozy for this so that

854
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:28,218
would be an application so if I if I

855
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:30,019
indeed implement that type of

856
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:33,739
functionality which would be somewhat

857
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:37,519
different than ours is today then I

858
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:39,619
could as well like implement the the the

859
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,930
constraint version right away I wouldn't

860
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:43,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of then suddenly on the</font>

861
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:46,808
device in prevent two different

862
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:50,119
mechanisms so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be different</font>

863
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:52,849
from what ours is in any other respect

864
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we are looking at the communication</font>

865
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:55,910
we are changing this communication

866
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:58,519
security protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ice yeah so</font>

867
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,690
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still owe us well yeah</font>

868
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:01,939
well but that's that's that's

869
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:04,789
differently nice anyway yeah but not

870
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:06,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily and so if I uh so what I</font>

871
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:08,209
what I would most likely envision if you

872
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:10,008
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tablet or mobile phone you lose</font>

873
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:12,348
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing libraries I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font>

874
00:50:10,009 --> 00:50:16,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">the authorization server and it may use</font>

875
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:18,799
HTTP and and all these fancy stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

876
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:21,440
then it gets and it gets an access token

877
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:26,150
and that access token instead of it

878
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:27,979
being chased on encoded it would now bc

879
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:30,619
bo encoded but it would just be smaller

880
00:50:27,979 --> 00:50:32,239
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be passed along to the for</font>

881
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:36,259
example to the IOT device and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

882
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,880
be that it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be processed by the</font>

883
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:39,589
resources / locally or what would be

884
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,859
then bounced off using token

885
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:45,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">introspection back to the back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

886
00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:47,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">backend that sort of mine I think we</font>

887
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:50,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">should take this offline but but just</font>

888
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,709
just final point for my side<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

889
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking about the format of the access</font>

890
00:50:51,709 --> 00:50:56,839
token

891
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:59,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">I I'm pointing at an application</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

892
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,610
cozy is used where where you could

893
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,900
really could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for RSA and</font>

894
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:04,880
that's when you have the communication

895
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,590
security application layer security

896
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,850
between clients now an authorization

897
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,980
server so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

898
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:12,529
case that's fine that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example we're</font>

899
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:17,210
introduced that's just co-op profile

900
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:20,390
phrase let me so it's okay if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

901
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:24,920
that use case but at least I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

902
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:27,770
it for us at the moment I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

903
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,560
there's use cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I OT is important</font>

904
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:32,540
and it's important to Microsoft and

905
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,270
we'll probably use elliptic curve

906
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:38,390
algorithms in those cases there's also

907
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:40,610
some cases where cozy is going to be

908
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:43,660
used in unconstrained environments

909
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:46,640
whether processor rich or bandwidth rich

910
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:51,020
but because you may be only want to have

911
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:54,589
one cryptographic format you may choose

912
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:56,870
the Seaboard format to use everywhere

913
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:59,780
and appropriate algorithms to use in

914
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:04,580
different parts of it and these places

915
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:10,990
have a RSA and may have RSA keys and may

916
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:20,840
use them right and I did this draft

917
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:24,169
because we do have those use cases so

918
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:30,290
from the harm it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a kunia so we</font>

919
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:32,450
have snidely more support to to see so

920
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:35,360
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked her to see the need for</font>

921
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:38,419
visual<font color="#E5E5E5"> record and Mohan for further need</font>

922
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:41,710
to this work but I'll also some people

923
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">say they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the need and also</font>

924
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:46,880
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information so i</font>

925
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:51,740
think we need more discussion on this

926
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:55,700
topic and we're not ready for adoption

927
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:58,939
yet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's my understanding so we</font>

928
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:01,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">will make poor in the mini needs to</font>

929
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,920
continue the discussion and then find

930
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:06,740
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use case and to decide if they</font>

931
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:13,020
either to take this over work or a lot

932
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:22,339
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you so waste of you</font>

933
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:22,340
some okay thank you

934
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,210
you
