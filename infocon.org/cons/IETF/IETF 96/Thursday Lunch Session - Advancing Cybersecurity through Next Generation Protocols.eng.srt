I I'll do my best I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

14
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,270
lecterns because it makes me<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel too</font>

15
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:24,440
formal and this is an absolutely

16
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:25,699
informal conversation so first of all I

17
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,270
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for allowing me to</font>

18
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:33,020
spend some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and share some</font>

19
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:36,500
some thoughts some experiences and I

20
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:42,170
have some requests and suggestions in

21
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:47,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope I I'm an interloper</font>

23
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:55,189
I've questioned rfcs not implement RFC's

24
00:10:51,790 --> 00:11:00,560
but that's the limit of my IETF exposure

25
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:03,980
I what I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> share with you is what</font>

26
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,900
I call a you know view from the field or

27
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,900
report from the field I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

cyber security but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before that then</font>

31
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:23,000
there wasn't before that I was deeply

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:26,630
involved with several engineering

38
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:50,170
let me tell you a little bit about

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:52,670
myself I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started to read mark twain</font>

47
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:19,290
that ship is more than just tracking

48
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,050
has all of her health records it has her

49
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:26,130
vaccination schedule it has her likes

50
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,959
and dislikes for food and if i'm lucky i

51
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,890
could not actually track her too that's

52
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:36,000
a byproduct but it's it's it sets the

years 30 years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completed</font>

57
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,589
my first major sitter of series of

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,270
projects let me give a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

59
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">background my first job out of</font>

60
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:01,199
university was at Argonne National

61
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,610
Laboratories now I didn't know anything

62
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
about nuclear physics I didn't know

63
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,760
anything about national battery testing

64
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,320
labs I didn't know anything about much

65
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,770
of anything except i could write good

66
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,870
real time code and by real-time it meant

67
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was done it was not done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in real time</font>

68
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,440
but those persistence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran in real</font>

69
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:21,330
time and basically today we call these

70
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:27,330
embedded systems so I'm from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cleveland</font>

71
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:31,290
Ohio Midwest boy drive chicago and i go

72
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:34,589
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the labs and big burly men with guns</font>

73
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:37,709
greet me and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking what am i</font>

74
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:42,540
doing what am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I getting into here and as</font>

75
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:48,829
a escort me to my first building there

76
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:51,240
are these very short very albino deer

77
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:54,630
and I'm thinking women I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they have</font>

78
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,610
nuclear stuff here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

79
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,060
thinking dear and seeing deer and

80
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,500
something's not correlating and I'm

81
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,579
thinking what am I getting myself into

82
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,890
and then I meet the lab director who was

83
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,980
very gracious and welcome the newcomer

84
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:14,910
and said I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

85
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the deer aren't you and it's not</font>

86
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,050
honestly yes sir it did cross my mind

87
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:21,420
goes don't worry they were bred this way

88
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:23,310
there from Switzerland and it was part

89
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,099
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deal for the</font>

90
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:31,140
and grant for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our national labs and I'm</font>

91
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:35,520
sticking to it so my first job was

92
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">writing code for one of the reactors</font>

93
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,400
that our kind of had a time is called

94
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,959
the tree tree acts as a thermal test

95
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:46,290
reactor and I wrote code for folks who

96
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">are far far smarter than I am in fact</font>

97
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,900
several<font color="#E5E5E5"> were up for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> novell for the Nobel</font>

98
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,050
years later but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like a Disneyland</font>

99
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,459
for nerds you know you could do anything

100
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,459
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want it was there there</font>

101
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,550
was no<font color="#E5E5E5"> time was kind of an option but</font>

102
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,830
delivery and accuracy was critical so I

103
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,900
wrote code for the treat reactor to

104
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:09,300
manage to collect the kilometer which

105
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,620
moved back and forth and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> physicist</font>

106
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,900
can do their physics stuff or whatever

107
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,940
and they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that the</font>

108
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,890
data game was correct and it was all

109
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,650
that kind of nonsense so I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

110
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:22,620
were happy my boss was happy and nothing

111
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:26,040
glowed so that was success and good

112
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,870
times right so back in the day you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

113
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,870
people play around in the middle of the

114
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,280
nuker reactor how quaint you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

115
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,480
guess then they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the signs</font>

116
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:40,920
up so I cut my teeth on<font color="#CCCCCC"> real time</font>

117
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,330
systems and part of that was making not

118
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,310
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> the analog digital digital</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analog</font>

119
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,900
conversion so I said which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy but</font>

120
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,310
making systems that weren't meant to

121
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,470
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other talk to each other</font>

122
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,390
that was my introduction to networking

123
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,030
although we didn't call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it networking</font>

124
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:56,160
then we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gon control plane not to</font>

125
00:15:54,030 --> 00:16:01,230
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it not to convert not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be confused</font>

126
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,780
with today's control playing so about 25

127
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,480
years after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I left this program i ran</font>

128
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,130
across one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the departmental directors</font>

129
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,290
have been retired i was invited to his

130
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,030
retirement he goes you know Kevin

131
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,360
they're still running this the reactor

132
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:19,589
with your code 25 years later now this

133
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,260
is in western Idaho so if you ever go to

134
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:24,360
western Idaho don't I would fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

135
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,279
around it to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you know</font>

136
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,310
Kevin's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old code is still</font>

137
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:31,650
running there somewhere on a reactor but

138
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,920
what I what I did realize was that i

139
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:36,429
liked the communications narrative<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

140
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">liked that it was</font>

141
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:44,149
in at university I had instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font>

142
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:47,509
a spoken language I took Fortran<font color="#E5E5E5"> and APL</font>

143
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:51,429
and it qualifies for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for foreign</font>

144
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:55,160
language which was hilarious but I

145
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:57,679
really enjoy making things work that

146
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,459
weren't meant to work together so after

147
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:04,158
argon<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ended up at a company who was</font>

148
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:06,559

that defense data network in a mill net

150

me at a very young as a very young

156
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:32,720
engineer so in 1986 the year I ATF was

157
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:37,010
found it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was an interesting year for a</font>

being a billionaire we had the mat s ii

162
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,418
remember that but that was the first

165
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:06,679
big thing for some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us who were Apple</font>

166
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,850
devotees back in the day and we had the

167
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:13,100
internet looking something like this and

168
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:17,199
as i said i was working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> DD had just</font>

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:20,209
come off working on d DN yep done and

170
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:25,130
then I had moved to this little

heard of it berkeley yeah well if he

174
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,950
noticed all the universities to the

right are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> east coast and then they</font>

176
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:41,110
threw in a little carrot to berkeley but

177
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:45,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was working on bsd and other things</font>

178
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:47,990
the sum of the bsd stack came my way my

transitions from proprietary networks to

of course tcp/ip base but it was a

186
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,870
learning experience but what I took from

187
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,480
that from my<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience is prior</font>

188
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:13,929
especially under working on a DD n was

189
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:20,530
that we practitioners need to think

190
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:22,870
about a future state where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't know</font>

everyone who is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with</font>

194
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were so prescient that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Porton</font>

195
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,890
that we foresaw the collapse of 32-bit

196
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,930
address space not even close but we were

197
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">already going from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 networks to</font>

00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:43,300
30,000 networks in a very short period

199
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:46,540
and all they always weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

200
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:49,290
we knew they always weren't associations

201
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,460
that we knew we needed a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different model</font>

202
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,950
so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a group of us who kind of</font>

203
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,830
banded together of course if you've been

204

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berkeley but the one of the great the</font>

some of the best food in the world we

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,600
call it gourmet ghetto I think there's a

208
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,270
bit at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 companies started on</font>

211
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:14,110
just collaborate and say look what can

212
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,570
we do that's different what can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

213
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:19,030
with the tools available or oh by the

214
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:23,260
way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to write code so we can</font>

215
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:26,230
write new tools what could we do and we

216
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:29,290
got shot it down we got a shadow downs

217
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,690
quite simply by the moat<font color="#E5E5E5"> sand castle</font>

218
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:34,620
folks who simply said put up big

219
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,480
barriers and move on we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time</font>

220
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:40,389
so I sure that with you because I look

221
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:44,410
back now as a practitioner wish a wish

222
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:47,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had the the temperament the</font>

then to have stood up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say no we need</font>

225
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,149
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this the right way now now fast</font>

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,570
forward I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to close out a little</font>

frankly to which is it's a benefit to

weren't so pleasant happened to noble by

discussion these were extremely

250
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:17,349
catastrophic events that were caused by

251
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:23,299
oversight under site just human error

252
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:26,869
both could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been avoided we done</font>

253
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:30,619
with that in retrospect but they could

<font color="#E5E5E5">have been avoided locally that's what</font>

255
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:37,188
I'm gonna pause for that for now so

256
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:39,439
after 18 years of running security teams

00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:06,199
then sorry Freudian slip that's a

266
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:09,408
companies who have to take financial

267
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:12,799
instruments with a username and a

268
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:14,449

269
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,389
care how strong your password is it

270
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:16,889
doesn't matter

271
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:17,968
when the key when the keystroke logger

272
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:23,299
has been on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your computer for the last</font>

273
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:28,979
two years i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> get data dumps from</font>

274
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:31,339
the dark web purveyors and it would

275
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:35,839
start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thousand credentials a week</font>

276
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:40,589
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 until hit a crescendo of</font>

250,000 unique credentials in a week of

278
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:46,019
my customers and oh by the way they have

279
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:47,159
some great passwords in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there extremely</font>

280
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:50,009
good in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use one of them now that</font>

281
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:53,849
so good but they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised so it</font>

282
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:56,369
doesn't matter so how do you actually

283
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">conduct</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> commerce when your customers</font>

284
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:00,119
coming to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to determine</font>

285
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,369
whether whether she's real or not well

286
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:04,589
clearly you have to use other analytic

287
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:05,999
tools to determine the buying behavior

288
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:08,489
patterns all kind of good stuff and oh

289
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:12,299
by the way geolocation is not one of

290
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:14,669
them it's irrelevant but whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

291
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:18,209
you go directly to the electronics

292
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:20,279
section by five iPads as a hint whether

293
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:23,729
or not you change your shipping address

294
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:25,979
is another hint whether you do the

295
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:29,249
myriad of activities<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

296
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:31,919
traditional themes will do are the hints

297
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:33,719
not your user password and not your

298
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,859
geolocation so I'm just throwing out

299
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:36,299
there it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of a pet</font>

300
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:37,228
peeve<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine where people think don't</font>

301
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,969
stronger pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're throwing our</font>

302
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:41,959
passwords and i can give you all the

303
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:46,919
strong password you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's irrelevant</font>

304
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:53,009
so after practicing this wonderful fun

305
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:55,739
and you know low taxing occupation for

306
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:57,709
18 years we figure what can we do to

307
00:24:55,739 --> 00:25:00,450
change the internet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did what anyone</font>

308
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:05,609
with a modicum of intelligence would do

309
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:07,349
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> SI ask Siri so as Siri how to improve</font>

310
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:10,408
the interest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet for</font>

311
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:11,579
security you know you can see some of

312
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:14,429
our answers there wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really that</font>

313
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:15,989
helpful so if you know Siri you know

314
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,339
that is some it's like Google search you

315
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:22,349
have to ask the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Crescent question the</font>

316
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:24,539
right way so I try it again and that

317
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:25,769
much help so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

318
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:30,170
better place to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask these</font>

319
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:34,500
questions then<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF so here I am</font>

320
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:36,450
so a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of quick quick run out</font>

321
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,460
of history many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in a room have</font>

322
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:42,870

327
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,270
question why but I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all know the</font>

328
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,040
polluted area it was kind of their we're

worm it was more like him or slug but

335
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,740
but our machines were slow so worm was

336
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:22,800
fast enough but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that did was that</font>

337
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,170
raise the consciousness of oh my god we

338
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:30,120
really have to do something because I'm

339
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:32,280
not in control of my assets<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had I was</font>

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> due til before we said dude chill I</font>

349
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:55,080
said we don't know what's going on that

350
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,600
was wake up moment for me and my team

351
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,550
especially the folks who were riding a

352
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,459
lot of the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people were relying</font>

353

on we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what was going on we</font>

354
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,350
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wherewithal and the</font>

355
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,450
tools at the time to determine it so if

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,560
you read the Cuckoo's Nest noclip stolen

357
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,250
all that kind of stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know me</font>

00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody who had spent as much time as</font>

360
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,960
records probably needs a life but we

361
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,790
were trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what was going</font>

362
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,680
on in real time and I'm gonna tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

363
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,909
this was an eye-opening experience and

364
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:28,680
one I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want I don't want to repeat</font>

365
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:31,470
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we no one knew and i underscore</font>

366
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,810
that the NSF folks didn't know we had

367
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,850
context of IBM they didn't know nobody

368
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,480
really knew on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first day when it was</font>

369
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:40,409
started but I bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up because</font>

370
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,900
since then of course the attacks have

371
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:50,970
gotten far more sophisticated

372
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:54,670
far more targeted and far more effective

373
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:58,270
so 2016 don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even worry about counting</font>

374
00:27:54,670 --> 00:28:00,190
it's just insane you can spend their

375
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:03,250
companies built on trying to calculate

376
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,840
how much of the impact there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

377
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,900
internet from at AXA silly it's a

378
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">specious a specious serif of descriptors</font>

379
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,820
for my perspective because it doesn't

380
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:15,670
matter the real number that matters is

381
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:20,050
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many are breaches of significance</font>

382
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:22,330
and the best estimates are around about

383
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,919
one a week of a significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach not</font>

384
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,980
and I say this with authority I used to

385
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,110
also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sea so at symantec in Iran</font>

386
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:32,320
one of the first research groups we had

387
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:34,899
on on breach detections so the consensus

388
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,450
around those who do this daily is as

389
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:47,290
about one a week this is 50 plus a year

390
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:49,080
of successful breaches so on the malware

391
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:52,540
side things are a little different

392
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,570
because frankly if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to break</font>

393
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,909
in and oh by the way I<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

394
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:01,330
as well we we didn't use the term white

395
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:04,630
hat hacking at hated that term but we

396
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:08,889
were favorable hackers and I almost

397
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:11,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">always got in layer 7 in fact we'd never</font>

398
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,940
not got in there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few times we got</font>

399
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,860
in through the plumbing by<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virtue</font>

400
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,980
of looking at change control for example

401
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,110
and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could through our</font>

402
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,720
reconnaissance we can tell most

403
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:25,419
companies we actually had a log now the

404
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,970
bad guys in the dark net<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellet of when</font>

405
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,710
companies have their change control

406
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,260
JPMorgan Chase for example the<font color="#CCCCCC"> story</font>

407
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:35,200
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there it's not necessary them</font>

408
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:38,590
tuesday at 7pm we knew it so tuesday

409
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:43,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 10pm is when we try our pens</font>

410
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:46,050
because guess what typically through a

411
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:48,700
change control window mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> are made</font>

412
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:53,590
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was that was just the right time</font>

413
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:55,430
for fishing right so we did that and so

414
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,280
layer 7 now<font color="#CCCCCC"> having said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

415
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,440
when people make mistakes on changes and

416
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:03,590
change controls is usually was it was

417
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,140
either a deprecated or an older release

418
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,370
for example good one who's always first

419
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,080
thing we do every one<font color="#CCCCCC"> does right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go for</font>

420
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,600
SNMP and DNS you just go right for that

421
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,970
is easy it's like the you know the slope

422
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,520
gazelle and when they when they made a

423
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,200
mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> BAM wear em they won't know it</font>

424
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,050
we're sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it was just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">very common fast forward today it's a</font>

426
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:26,450
lot harder because so much is also being

427
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:28,400
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

428
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,680
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the cloud actually</font>

429
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,630
is a really great buffer from a security

430
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:36,770
perspective a very great buffer makes it

431
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:40,420
a lot harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> not impossible so in 1986</font>

432
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:44,810
there were six confirmed well known

433
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:46,520
viruses because what happened was the

meant taking over with some exception

especially around the activist on

477
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:07,668
political activism but now we're talking

about changing records changing records

which we all hear about we hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,929
this all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time about taking your</font>

credit cards by the way the credit card

497
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,700
interesting it's important but those who

498
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,340
want to cause harm by leveraging the

499
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:17,658
internet itself can cause death and

500
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:19,470
destruction remember the Challenger and

501
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:24,030
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chernobyl</font>

502
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:25,678
well the nuclear sites of course are<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm</font>

503
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,429
air-gapped I don't know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not involved</font>

504
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore but what I hear is that there</font>

505
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:33,450
there's a pause and they said yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

506
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:36,540
air-gapped but still they still use of

507
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,618
course up tcp/ip throughout so somebody

508
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,219
who can jump the fence or under or

509
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:42,899
interject who knows is scary to me as a

510
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:44,250
practitioner as someone who's been

511
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:49,949
involved in that space it's a little

512
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:52,800
scary to me on the on the side with like

513
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:56,790
like the sorry aviation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that necessary</font>

514
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,710
the Challenger I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very scared we hear</font>

515
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,910
these stories about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people taking over</font>

516
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,230
there that's nonsense by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

517
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically did the maintenance mode</font>

518
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:07,440
that's on the ground a candle in here

519
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:10,220
yet the Tesla had their first incident

520
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,119
with with their autonomous driving

521
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,750
software is going to have problems

522
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,460
unfortunately someone did die now that

523
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,869
person probably shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have should</font>

524
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paying more attention</font>

525
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:22,680
to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand without</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clearing in</font>

526
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,629
on the details but the fact of having

527
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,250
cars being taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we have has been</font>

528
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:30,119
demonstrated<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and time and time</font>

529
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:32,240
again a targeted attack by on the

530
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:37,800
vehicle<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to happen unfortunately</font>

531
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:39,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to happen and that scares me as</font>

532
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,460
a practitioner because what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

533
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,619
that's better so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can't happen or</font>

534
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's extraordinarily rare to for the</font>

535
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:51,510
type of attack 2010 was a pivotal year a

536
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:54,750
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the malware and</font>

had not heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that was a very</font>

539
00:35:56,369 --> 00:36:03,180
widespread very likely nation-state

540
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,270
attack but it it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter who did</font>

541
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,669
it it happened code was expunged I mean

542
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:11,520
was I'm sorry was removed from a lot of

543
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:14,010
companies but a reason when I bring up a

544
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,670
roar in particular is because five years

545
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:21,450
prior that exact same attack happened to

546
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:24,030
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a couple of other companies but</font>

547
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:27,149
we didn't share we could have prevented

548
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,970
it had there been mechanism to make some

549
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:32,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these changes it didn't happen so</font>

550
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:38,330
we're came back five years later fall

551
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:43,069
are more effective we also had a couple

552
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:46,250
of we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stuxnet right well Stuxnet</font>

553
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,810
forever change the game we also had a

554
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,980
choux Mon if you don't remember to

555
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,630
remember that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chamoun I'm sorry if you</font>

556
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:53,000
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well both illusion</font>

557
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,970
around 2010 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why they were so</font>

558
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,550
impactful because now they're showing

559
00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:00,549
that i can do destruction on equipment

560
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:07,970
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet ok ok the genies out</font>

561
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,530
of the bottle now it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back no</font>

562
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,450
she moon was kind of cool because it

563
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,640
just destroyed 30,000 pcs which was

564
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:18,189
interesting I mean it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rumor that</font>

565
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dell did it but it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rumor but it</font>

566
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:25,250
forever changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the face of these</font>

567
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,470
attackers because some are politically

568
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:30,680
motivated some are financially motivated

569
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:33,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">and some are just motivated but the fact</font>

570
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">is they can actually cause harm shut</font>

571
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:41,890
down refineries<font color="#CCCCCC"> shut down hospitals</font>

572
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:43,819
things are changing on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network side</font>

573
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:47,029
everybody take deep breaths not a lot

574
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:49,060
going on there why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we all know</font>

575
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:51,380
the answer we're fairly resilient right

00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:09,140
talked to my peers and say how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

597
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,930
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why I brought this point up</font>

598
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,419
was because actually again happened to

already being just snarfed like crazy so

00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:13,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does still occur if the efficacy from</font>

the from the attackers perspective is

605
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,640
not there if I'm an attacker I want your

606
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,380
content who cares i'm going to take your

611
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,009
over for over 30 years here are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

612
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,530
my observations number one from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cyber</font>

613
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:41,160
security perspective is that hygiene is

614
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:43,080
still appalling this is nothing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,020
can necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> address from IETF</font>

616
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,069
perspective the masterís<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

617
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:53,000
there are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll talk about some</font>

618
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:56,930
suggestions that I have but the need for

619
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,060
companies to do a better job is acute

620
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:02,118
and there are reasons why we don't for

621
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:04,970
example the ask a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIO how many</font>

622
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:08,910
application she has in her portfolio

623
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:13,049
well over a thousand some 20 22 years

624
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:15,089
old and you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to</font>

625
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:17,820
refresh that so they're a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their</font>

626
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:18,960
their mitigating rationale for some of

627
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,040
the hygiene proper the hygiene problem

628
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,300
is the biggest one because again it's an

629
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:28,440
attacker that's how I<font color="#CCCCCC"> get in poor</font>

630
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:34,820
designs poor procedures and horrific

631
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,820
coding again that's how I get in

632
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:42,240
automation is something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a lot</font>

633
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:45,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">about on the operation site and do very</font>

635
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,819
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we don't do a lot of more</font>

636
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:52,980
automation is because it's hard it's

637
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">extremely hard and we're doing</font>

638
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,720
automation on systems that weren't

639
00:40:54,270 --> 00:41:02,090
designed to be automated so

640
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:05,310
you see lots and lots of Python writers

641
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:09,180
lots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of Python scripts try to</font>

00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:11,220
do things that are adding very

00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:16,589
inadequate band-aids to a very

we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address but I don't hear</font>

648
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:39,630
answers of how to address it if you look

at a typical organization 4535<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 70,000</font>

firewalls our sins everything that we

662
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:24,890
use from a security perspective is dying

663
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:27,230
under its own weight the average fortune

different products count them 40

666
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:36,470
different products and so what I asked

667
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">my last two teams to do was tell me</font>

totally insane but yet that's what so

675
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,089
many organizations are doing it's a

I pick an arbitrary number i said okay

i'll tell you why we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go from</font>

privacy it's not perfect privacy so I

687
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,410
had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of overlapping products in a</font>

688
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,140
portfolio and all that we collapse it

689
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:28,609
down and sure enough it really helped<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

690
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,989
I got time back in our pockets to

691
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:33,859
actually do the hard work that we should

692
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:37,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">be doing but this is not sustainable and</font>

693
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:39,558
oh by the way I argue that that even

694
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:43,660
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten data came down to didn't make</font>

695
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:47,839
me tremendously safer secure should say

696
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:53,930
we have a problem and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

697
00:43:47,839 --> 00:44:01,009
to manage through this without being so

698
00:43:53,930 --> 00:44:02,269
tied to our own solutions we had we lack

699
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:04,579
insights into the networking as a

700
00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:08,089
consumer as a practitioner we lack the

701
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:09,739
insights into the network and of course

702
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:11,150
we all know the talent sure if you let

703
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:13,430
me I problems everyone has that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

704
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">universal but is it made more acute when</font>

705
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,950
I'm spending forty two percent of my

time management my management system oh

707
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:21,910
yeah complexity

708
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:32,079
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a world where the consumers</font>

709
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:38,089

they won't use ot ot peas or anything

00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:53,150
this okay we work around it the

on here and we're stuck with okay I tell

724
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:23,589
understand that we have to understand

725
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:26,869
that someone decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw this up</font>

726
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:28,880
it's a warning to the user that hey you

727
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:31,700
may not want to do this and there's

728
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,280
whatever I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get over there this is</font>

729
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,689
what we are dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

730
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with it at a very very large</font>

731
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:40,849
scale we need to change a paradigm we

732
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:45,559
really fundamental paradigm and this is

733
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:49,670
the beginning my ask of<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF so we've</font>

734
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:53,839
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working in a world for almost 40</font>

735
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:57,020
years now<font color="#CCCCCC"> of assume trust right if you</font>

736
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:59,240
if you give me if you can shake my hand

737
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:03,410
in the proper<font color="#CCCCCC"> way in a nutso secret way</font>

738
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:08,839
we're good come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in well we have to</font>

739
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:11,899
start to change that I think you know

740
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:13,880
DNS SEC is on the right direction why

741
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,280
the adoption isn't higher I have no idea

742
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,990
I just really don't understand that 1i

743
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,760
scratching my head like all the time on

744
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:21,229
this one's like well we know they have a

745
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good solution why we're using go</font>

746
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:28,250
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> please I'm sorry you read the</font>

747
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:30,169
slide exactly and that's exactly the

748
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:32,540
challenge we have we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get past</font>

749
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,140
that we collectively that's me on the

750

user

751
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:37,700
unity and you on the design community we

752
00:46:35,779 --> 00:46:40,010
have to do a better job because this is

753
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,629
not sustainable I do not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

754
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,579
responsible for some from someone

755
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:45,799
targeted attack on it on a autonomous

756
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:47,569
driving vehicle I don't want to be there

757
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:55,700
I don't want to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the responsibility</font>

758
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:59,288
on my shoulders convenience so let's

759
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,288
talk about convenience since we're here

760
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:06,380
who is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is inconvenienced the</font>

designer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the implementer or the or the</font>

or the consumer consumer being in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

763
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:17,960
case I'm sorry no wrong answer all of us

764
00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:19,400
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in Keynesian that we're the</font>

765
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,779
ones who have to deal with it right

766
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're the ones would have to implement</font>

767
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:28,240
and oh by the way add more stuff to to

768
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:32,538
circumvent the weaknesses back to my 42

769
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:34,430
different security services that is not

770
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:36,319
sustainable we have to inconvenience

771
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:37,250
everyone a little bit we're all in this

772
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,490
together all three all three

773
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:44,119
organizations or three groups so I think

774
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:48,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the things is to consider in any</font>

775
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:51,559
new design reputation I am a tremendous

776
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,549
believer in crowdsourcing it works it's

777
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:55,339
hard to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your thumb on the scale and</font>

778
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:57,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">crowdsourcing people may be wrong in a</font>

779
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:59,990
crowd right we see this all the time in

780
00:47:57,619 --> 00:48:03,440
elections right people can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong in a</font>

781
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:05,979
crowd but that's okay because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

782
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:11,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">now you have a much better indication of</font>

783
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:13,730
the explicit trust not a hundred percent

784
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:19,819
which now you're now you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight</font>

785
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:22,579
to add to your decision one of the

786
00:48:19,819 --> 00:48:24,970
things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do as we all know is</font>

787
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:27,289
that we don't we don't associate

791
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:39,859
to use yes it's hard yes circuit I mean

792
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:44,480
so certificates and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pti it hard and as</font>

793
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:45,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">and clearly it's not a panacea one of</font>

the

795
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:49,160
that was a semantic we were going to

796
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:50,420
know we were in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGI business and you</font>

797
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,160
know we all know if you've been to a

798
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,989
signing ceremony with your hood and

799
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything right it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult it's difficult to manage it's</font>

801
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:59,479
difficult to manage when when

802
00:48:57,529 --> 00:49:01,729
individuals leave your company who are

803
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:05,749
part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signing right this is hard</font>

804
00:49:01,729 --> 00:49:07,299
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard but we have to stand</font>

805
00:49:05,749 --> 00:49:11,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">up and take that challenge I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

806
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:14,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">again DNS SEC is in a good example of a</font>

807
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:16,969
framework but as we come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with new</font>

808
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:20,509
protocols especially for key important

810
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:28,519
consider affirmatively associating this

811
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,589
is the one that troubles me the most on

812
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:34,339
the implementer side i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

813
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:37,219
implementations of SNMP one that meets

the letter in a spirit of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC one</font>

815
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:42,130
that meets the letter when is the spirit

816
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:44,829
guess which two<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to tack and</font>

817
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:49,249
guess which two i probably will get in

818
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:51,199
we have to reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ambiguity now I</font>

819
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:53,689
say this from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different perspective I</font>

820
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:56,359
came from a nancy world<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

implementation but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end there was</font>

827
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:14,599
a very little room for ambiguity there

828
00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:17,119
was some of course because why humans

829
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:18,890
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still involved but we need to</font>

00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:32,959
but the bad guys can figure it out could

836
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,839

have to automate it but consider it and

855
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:35,010
again it remarkable when folks spent the

that we we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a lot when I</font>

861
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,520
mean Federation my time identity

862
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,470
necessarily but just Federation in a

863
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,940
sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my domain especially I'm a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing right let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us do that and so</font>

867
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:07,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can do that from everything from</font>

868
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:10,470
authentication authorization lookups are

869
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:13,320
cashing could be a control and vetted

870
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:14,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">caching for example let's assume that</font>

871
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,380
that Federation capabilities are it's

872
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:19,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">not there for everybody and won't be but</font>

873
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:22,740
for large organizations it certainly can

874
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:24,210
be and virtualization of course we all

875
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,830
know this is nothing new but assume

876
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:28,170
that's committed to fall if I'm if I'm

877
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:32,460
building anything today it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font>

878
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:34,830
with with virtualization now there and

879
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network itself has to be part of the</font>

880
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:40,109
solution it does so for all the network

881
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,140
practitioners we have to be part of the

882
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:44,940
solution and not and not a innocent

883
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,589
bystander it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like this smart</font>

884
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:51,140
highway and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be part of the</font>

885
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:54,660
solution so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do this right</font>

886
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:57,600
when that intelligent vehicle is a

887
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:59,759
targeted attack and someone dies we will

888
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,680
see far more legislation which gives us

889
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,690
less flexibility to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

890
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,419
we believe are right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

891
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:08,520
as a observer I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very active on</font>

892
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hill I've been brought in many times</font>

893
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,529
to talk to

894
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:17,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Congress's Senate in the US in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the EU in</font>

895
00:53:13,529 --> 00:53:19,979
Brussels about pending legislation and

896
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:22,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact well look this is this is</font>

897
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:24,680
real there are some terrible

898
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:27,450
legislations that are already in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

899
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:30,509
to to date with exception of one they

900
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:32,430
have not been prescriptive that's the

901
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:34,200
next generation they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell us</font>

902
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:36,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to do our work by laws and of course</font>

903
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:39,149
that's something we don't want but if we

904
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:42,419
now then pause there for a quick second

905
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:44,249
because in the US there's an experienced

906
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:48,719
executive order in 2012 the president

907
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:51,479
said Val shell 6 share intelligence with

908
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,849
the private sector didn't happen four

909
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:56,160
years later three years later<font color="#E5E5E5"> a law came</font>

910
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:59,759
out see is a in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. basically said</font>

911
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,140
the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but who to share with was</font>

912
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:03,029
always the problem because if you're a

913
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,519
vertical like a financial industries and

914
00:54:03,029 --> 00:54:07,349
like fine you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it for years</font>

915
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:09,660
but if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> who d shared with</font>

916
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:11,729
right getting so now there's a statute

917
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">that says now you have to share you have</font>

918
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:16,439
to consume it and there's no vehicle to

919
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:17,819
do it so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the artifact of</font>

920
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,469
poor artifact of laws and way to be

921
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:21,630
careful with and if we do our job right

922
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:24,329
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help to circumvent some of this</font>

923
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:25,829
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely a my soapbox sorry</font>

924
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:30,140
about that but it's been years and years

925
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and years on this thang</font>

926
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:46,000
I will take questions bubbly go ahead

927
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:48,430
Carrie Lynn<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh in an earlier century</font>

928
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,470
something like the launch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sputnik</font>

929
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:52,970
really changed you know the education

930
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:55,160
system in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

931
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:58,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">us are sort of the product of that at</font>

932
00:54:55,160 --> 00:55:00,319
least those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us with gray hair it</font>

933
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:04,640
seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me that you know what you're</font>

934
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:07,000
sort of implying is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

935
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,859
things a lot differently we need to

936
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,460
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way we educate computer</font>

937
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:16,070
science students who exactly is going to

938
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:19,130
make that clarion call and who's going

939
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:22,070
to set you know the agenda that is a

940
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:23,630
very very good question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I too even</font>

941
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:26,120
though i don't have gray hair yet if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

942
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:30,050
had a beard it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was a student</font>

943
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:32,509
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60s and there we do need that</font>

944
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:35,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">clearing call I don't I don't know I'm</font>

945
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:37,640
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in stem are my company is</font>

946
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:40,010
very involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> with stem but maybe it's</font>

947
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">as an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where an ietf cannot reach</font>

948
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:44,390
you know I don't know I don't I wish I

949
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:46,130
had the answer that but that's the first

950
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:49,220
step in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12-step program is this even</font>

951
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:52,370
acknowledging we have a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I I</font>

952
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:54,319
intentionally try to scare people and I

953
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:56,420
don't use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't with</font>

954
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity but what I'm starting to</font>

955
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:03,110
see now and starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see things that</font>

956
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:06,080
are people can die I get nervous and we

957
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:08,360
collectively are part of that so I

958
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,340
suggest maybe the outreach<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my a tip</font>

959
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:12,140
I don't again I'm an interloper<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

960
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:14,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen to drop in and and hopefully</font>

961
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:18,379
share some words with you but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

962
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:20,509
do something stem is very is a very in

963
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:23,240
thing right now it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the right</font>

964
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:25,370
vehicle i will tell you coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

965
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,799
academia the teaching of computer

966
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:30,650
science is woefully on it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

967
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,960
just ridiculous still is people are

968
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:35,780
focusing on pin testing and breaking

969
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,850
things not designing things to be

970
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:39,350
resilient from a security attack and we

971
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,970
have to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well but I hear</font>

972
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:43,970
you loud<font color="#E5E5E5"> and clear again the IETF and if</font>

973
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:48,379
I can help I'm more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than happy to help</font>

974
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:50,520
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sir hi I'm Daniel con Gilmore</font>

from the ACLU the American

00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,880
so thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming today and I totally</font>

977
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree with you that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this there's</font>

978
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:01,060
a set of massive problems around secured

979
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:02,350
infrastructure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust and I I had a</font>

980
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,259
question for you specifically in your

981
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:09,310
role as a Juniper security officer about

982
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:12,310
the recent screen OS vulnerabilities you

983
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:16,690
guys had used dual<font color="#CCCCCC"> EC in your in the</font>

984
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:20,830
screen OS devices and with with with a

985
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:23,800
custom cue so that when the dual EC

986
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:26,319
vulnerability was announced and made it

987
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:28,060
made quite clear I believe your response

988
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:31,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">was it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we use we use our own cue</font>

989
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,980
so my question for you was well I guess

990
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,170
it's sort of a two-part thing but why

991
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,430
did you choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use dual EC drbg when</font>

992
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:38,950
it was slower than the other our

993
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:41,350
energies in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first place and to how</font>

994
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:43,899
did you generate your own cue but what

995
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:45,460
mechanism did you use was so so I'm

996
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,460
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer this the following way</font>

art the RNG discussion at that time I

1002
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:12,070
wasn't with juniper but I was

1003
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,569
implementing ECC and we were debating

1004
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:16,210
works ourselves how to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

1005
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:18,100
nobody knew the proper way then when

1006
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:20,530
this was originally done so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

1007
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,960
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and and and kindly</font>

1008
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:24,370
ask that you review the FAQ I believe it

1009
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:29,380
may have been refreshed I'm not so sure

1010
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:31,900
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but but from from your point</font>

1011
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:34,240
about trust and that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

1012
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:35,860
assume that devices are malicious that

1013
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,379
are that we are interacting with over

1014
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:39,700
the network I'm wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean surely</font>

1015
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:43,000
you understand that there's a that

1016
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:44,740
juniper suffered a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brute like trust and</font>

1017
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,470
juniper devices must have gone down as a

1018
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:48,729
result of seeing the the series of

1019
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,839
vulnerabilities that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced</font>

1020
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,160
learning and I'm wondering if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1021
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,600
any proposals for how we can restore

1022
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,230
trust in the Juniper Networks like have

1023
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:58,509
you guys considered for example opening

1024
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:59,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">your source control so that people can</font>

1025
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:03,880
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually happened</font>

1026
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:06,040
or any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I hear you and I</font>

1027
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,560
really I really and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not i'm not</font>

1028
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,480
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to to to kind of shortcut</font>

1029
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,099
the answer but i do appreciate the

1030
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,079
question it's a valid question but i

1031
00:59:12,099 --> 00:59:15,310
believe we've answered with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1032
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,470
exception of the source control access

1033
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:21,849
which we do forget for certain parties

1034
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:23,200
under NDA and licensing I think we've

1035
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:25,270
aunt I think we've answered that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1036
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:28,118
remember this was also screen OS product

1037
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:31,390
which yes people are still using it was

1038
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:35,320
a completely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prada than we do</font>

1039
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:40,930
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jews completely different ok any</font>

1040
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:43,000
questions yes so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Jim Galvin</font>

1041
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:45,040
and I something just<font color="#E5E5E5"> occurred to me and</font>

1042
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,380
listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last question because</font>

1043
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:50,650
he asked you about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how did you</font>

1044
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:52,240
the presumption was that trust in

1045
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:53,710
juniper<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have gone down result of</font>

1046
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,390
the incident and so what are you doing

1047
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,950
to bring it back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I want</font>

1048
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:59,160
to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to challenge the assertion that</font>

1049
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:03,430
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1050
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,960
what would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I mean I get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

1051
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:07,118
lot of which you said and something that

1052
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've always felt about security and</font>

1053
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,349
security incidents is the fundamental

1054
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:14,050
problem is the fact that people really

1055
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:16,420
don't seem to care I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough</font>

1056
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:18,760
people or not the right people care so

1057
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,829
did your trusted<font color="#E5E5E5"> trusted juniper go down</font>

1058
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,720
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know tiny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1059
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:24,910
blip for a moment among people who are

1060
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,740
practitioners but in reality is a

1061
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:28,390
practical<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter who noticed and who</font>

1062
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">really cared and why would it matter and</font>

1063
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:31,660
wouldn't you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's part of the</font>

1064
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,640
problem that we're dealing with here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1065
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,868
in the large it seems that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

1066
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,549
message that you're trying to convey

1067
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:38,589
here you know I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not so much</font>

1068
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,819
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a former complacency I think</font>

1069
01:00:38,589 --> 01:00:43,089
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind what you're addressing it and</font>

1070
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:45,520
I'd say no I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the practitioners we</font>

1071
01:00:43,089 --> 01:00:48,310
had without<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doubt our biggest response</font>

1072
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,140
was you were quick to respond you're

1073
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:52,150
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> and transparent as much as you can</font>

1074
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:55,420
be on this problem anywhere in your

1075
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:57,280
corrected it right so if there was a

1076
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:59,319
blip i think it was restored in fact to

1077
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,300
a customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was there's been their</font>

1078
01:00:59,319 --> 01:01:02,529
response and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're</font>

1079
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,790
being nice they were dishonest because

1080
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:06,010
it does happen it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this is not</font>

1081
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:10,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">unique to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jennifer we all know this this</font>

1082
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:15,610
purchase a issue i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1083
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:18,370
less<font color="#E5E5E5"> about lack of interest then that's</font>

1084
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:20,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of the world how many how many</font>

1085
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:24,430
updates do we get across our portfolio

1086
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:26,680
each week it used to be a lot you know

1087
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,940
patch tuesday was ok I'm going on

1088
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,169
vacation Monday night right there's

1089
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:31,630
nowhere to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on patch tuesday</font>

1090
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:33,460
it's gotten better but we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1091
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:35,980
lot more in our in our in our inventory

1092
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:37,180
so we're always constantly passion it

1093
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:42,010
goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my management playing</font>

1094
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:44,109
discussion so we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now and i'm</font>

1095
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:46,660
saying let's not expect that let's

1096
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:49,210
change the entire paradigm to reduce the

1097
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:57,640
noise is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm suggesting it does</font>

1098
01:01:49,210 --> 01:02:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that make sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy is gone awhile</font>

1099
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:05,259
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm looking at this from like what</font>

1100
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:08,020
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your expectation towards the ietf</font>

1101
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:09,970
question in terms of improving security

1102
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:13,090
and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i noticed i</font>

1103
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:15,939
mean IDF we we cannot wake<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and then</font>

1104
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:18,640
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to do things but our standards</font>

1105
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:21,040
process is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the shortest maybe</font>

1106
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,740
not as bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an see but we take some</font>

1107
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,509
time and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time there's</font>

1108
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,910
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source community which kind of</font>

1109
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:29,950
moves a little bit faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i wondered</font>

1110
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,420
like what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your view like what it</font>

1111
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,910
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be your advice I mean is it like</font>

1112
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:35,200
do you feel like open source is actually

1113
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:37,120
solving your problems and maybe

1114
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,129
standardization is actually not fast

1115
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:41,410
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what you need is there</font>

1116
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:46,030
something you would like to advise<font color="#CCCCCC"> us on</font>

1117
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:48,730
how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work better some ideas from</font>

1118
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:52,540
your side<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Tobias correct I</font>

1119
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:55,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate the question two quick</font>

1120
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:57,670
answers one is my expectation my ask not

1121
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:58,750
expectation for my<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask of ietf and the</font>

1122
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:00,220
by the centralized if i have the same

1123
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:03,040
conversations with the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

1124
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:06,720
communities to is think differently to

1125
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:11,380
to abuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple right think different</font>

1126
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:14,580
when you design assuming harm as a

1127
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:17,470
starting principle can go a long way

1128
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:18,700
we'll find out it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other question</font>

1129
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:20,109
earlier question with regard to what do

1130
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:23,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do with training the next generation</font>

1131
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:25,740
is if they come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of school thing</font>

1132
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,049
this way can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you imagine the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

next<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation of protocols completely</font>

1134
01:03:28,049 --> 01:03:32,430
different right that's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask evaluative</font>

1135
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:34,289
to think a little differently right and

1136
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:37,649
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat prescriptive of what I'm</font>

asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a practitioner but at the</font>

1138
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:44,250
end of the day we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have what we have you</font>

1139
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:48,630
