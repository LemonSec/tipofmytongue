moments and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the session is mostly</font>

41
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:45,490
dedicated to discussing the RTC

42
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:48,580
web-related drafts review we need to get

process the plans we have for for future

45
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,240
work here in the close future and we

46

49
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:13,540
of this so regarding the working group

50
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:18,430
status we have one published RF seasons

51
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:21,430
lost my ATF meeting that's RFC 7850 on

52
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:25,740
registering the values for transporting

RTP over<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp under various OTP profiles</font>

54
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,020
we have three documents in the RFC

56
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:44,950
quite a while the last one has recently

60
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,040
I have to say I'm sorry that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's taken</font>

61
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:58,270
so long time but yeah I hope for

62
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,910
probably not finish happy for Marissa

63
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:03,370
fication but hopefully by it's a

64
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,870
temporary<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some serious</font>

65
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,090
progress on getting them done but I

66
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,930
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably into November</font>

67
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,929
before it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all resolved</font>

68
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:19,340
no I just take weird 891 days so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

69
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:27,170
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand that</font>

70
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:29,479
would be pretty impressive oh he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

71
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:33,530
I'm sure the chairs anyway of figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

72
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,690
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> prize if it you go do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that compaq is</font>

73
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,820
it ephemera am I remembering right that

74
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,650
we took the referent the normative

75
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,210
references the circuit breaker out of

76
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,460
that yes the circuit breaker wasn't done

77
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,400
in time I think the circuit breaker may

78
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:52,400
be about to catch up see you may or may

79
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:54,289
not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it back in its so</font>

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:01,429
calling are you expressing an opinion on

81
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:05,000
that or just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an FYI so I can see believe</font>

82
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:09,650
but hope that the circuit breaker is

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,630
about to go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC ft so you know it</font>

84
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,310
I think the reason the normative

85
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,590
reference was taken out was because the

86
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,920
circuit breaker wasn't ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

87
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's now about to become ready so I</font>

88
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't much care either way but if the</font>

89
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,350
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just because the other theft</font>

90
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,540
wasn't ready you may want to reverse

91
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:31,900
that decision given given that it can

92
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:40,670
probably be done trivially we note that

93
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:45,469
thank you we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mux attributes in</font>

94
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:47,780
ITF last call no drafts in is g review

95
00:07:45,470 --> 00:08:00,560
but we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> publication requested their</font>

a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of drafts that's waiting for</font>

98
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:08,570
right up in pretty good shape we have

99
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:11,660
working group consensus on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bundled</font>

100

101
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,070
also be presented in later slides I'm

102
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,159
not commenting too much on those right

103
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">now in working group last call we have</font>

104
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,980
the RTP stream constraints the red

105
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,550
drafts and the simulcast draft

106
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:30,190
and we have number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drafts also</font>

getting close to working group last call

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:37,960
and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those will be mentioned later</font>

109
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:43,209
as well we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any new work items</font>

110
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:45,100
since last ITF and we have a few drafts

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:56,110
it's mostly related to MSRP do you have

the stp this draft and the sctp stp we

draws drops we have to deal with and

124
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:37,720
they are ordered in terms of readiness

125
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:45,330
from top to bottom so we have the max

126
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:51,070
attributes in ITF last call and that is

127

depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bundle negotiation we</font>

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:15,280
dependencies that went with no direct

152
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,070
just quick comment I believe based on

153
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,020
discussion Chris their homework based on

154
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,980
discussion we have this way guys at

157
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:44,380
change anything but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just let you know</font>

158
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:47,080
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you yeah and also real quick so</font>

159
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,520
we'll have follow-up slides on several

160
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these just to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

161
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,840
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail but I know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that some of the</font>

162
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,070
ice folks they have some time

163
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,270
constraints so I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover</font>

164
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,910
here what we tried to do here with the

165
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,740
color coding was to show the<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents</font>

166
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are essentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outside the control</font>

167
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:06,550
of em<font color="#E5E5E5"> music but we depend on those and</font>

168
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:09,040
we're hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some status updates</font>

169
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,530
and hopefully some target dates in place

170
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,990
that would lift or address those

171
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:17,110
dependencies some house I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

172
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:24,550
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from the ice folks first of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all I'll get on an ice learning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

174
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:31,240
co-chair so we had a good session on I

175
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,069
screw up on the trickle eyes and I space

176
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,260
we serve of dependency for to you guys I

177
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,760
think we are very confident that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

178
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,330
be last calling them soon

179
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,610
august-september<font color="#CCCCCC"> time frame trickle is</font>

180
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,190
basically almost almost ready and I

181
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,920
space we are depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on still</font>

182
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,540
discussion on this issue called mobile

183
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,709
pacing how fast can you do collectively

184
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,300
checks we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk with try</font>

185
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:57,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">sport faults but i think we are making</font>

186
00:12:53,300 --> 00:13:01,069
okay so listen okay Martin can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> let</font>

187
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,870
latest on that disgusting so what it

188
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,760
looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> rye always kept my prime</font>

189
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,000
frame last starting last<font color="#E5E5E5"> call's at ice</font>

190
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,160
group well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay can we get a specific</font>

191
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,770
target date in place that we can shoot

192
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">for well guess i need to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

marking comment on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the latest on the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">transfer before that and just to be</font>

195
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,970
clear the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're pushing for</font>

196
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,710
all of this is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITC web has asked</font>

197
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,200
us to basically get all of this stuff

198
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,490
wrapped up and we're a little

199
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
uncomfortable with some of the draft

200
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,530
that are depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the ice</font>

201
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,880
drafts to just move them forward some of

202
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,990
the drafts are more or less ready on

203
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,420
their own but since they're referencing

204
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,980
things that we never know if it's going

205
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change but in another draft and it's</font>

206
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,280
a normative reference we just want to

207
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,050
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that we're in a position to</font>

208
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,699
move those<font color="#CCCCCC"> for so Martin going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as always</font>

209
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,920
so much Thompson we had a discussion

210
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,500
with the transport folks and got some

211
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,319
really good feedback and input from from

212
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,450
it won't be as simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you said but we</font>

213
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,850
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a very nice clear right up</font>

214
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,380
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jonah that describes exactly did</font>

215
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,070
sort of analytic framework that they

216
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:07,010
plan to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this and how how you</font>

217
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:10,070
would write this up including specifics

218
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">very specific and actionable you were</font>

219
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,310
hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this within sort of a month</font>

220
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,250
I think that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite realistic</font>

221
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:20,479
based on on this the right up was very

222
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:22,370
crisp so we have an answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

223
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,920
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more text than I imagined it would</font>

224
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:29,810
be but that's it is not much more I I

225
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,110
will do what I can to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that to the</font>

226
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,219
list<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to dig it out yeah the other</font>

227
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,720
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get up here to</font>

228
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,180
say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an impressive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of work</font>

229
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:44,330
and it's really good to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

230
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:47,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">dis mature I'm I'm impressed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so thanks</font>

231
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who did that another the</font>

232
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,490
RCC web chairs like to ride you pretty

233
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,110
hard on on this one it's Ted I mean

234
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,170
let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not beat around the bush on</font>

235
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,370
this one ted<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been asking for this</font>

236
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,569
for a very long time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is</font>

237
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,540
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting what he what he's asked</font>

238
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">for yeah this is actually pretty good so</font>

239
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,860
we but let's not make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> too negative</font>

240
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:08,480
think this is a good check I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

241
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:14,990
the dependency on<font color="#CCCCCC"> jcf but I guess that's</font>

242
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:17,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of unavoidable okay and one more</font>

243
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,269
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Carolyn again here on before I</font>

00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:24,410
less calling those documents and we will

246
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,089
be needing for reviews so everyone who

247

you can also ask in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your group able to</font>

particularly I space but the other I

262
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:11,779
stress that if you if you go through

263
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,670
this this flow for these brats it looks

264
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the critical dependencies so many</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these drafts depend on the ice for us</font>

266
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,699
particularly I suppose they do and

267
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,929
that's why we're pushing on it right and

268
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,219
we just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

269
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:23,899
officially<font color="#E5E5E5"> mature that we feel</font>

270
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,449
comfortable progressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other drafts</font>

271
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,589
it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be published but if</font>

272
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:30,019
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure that there's going to be</font>

273
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:31,459
changes then yeah that's a bit of an

274
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,899
issue that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to make sure to</font>

275
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:36,319
get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working class call sooner</font>

276
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:38,029
than later<font color="#CCCCCC"> woolley you on some and i</font>

277
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:41,360
just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remind everyone that the</font>

278
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:43,279
ice stuff depends on Stan which is in

279
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,120
the tram working group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs review</font>

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:52,189
there as well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stun base draft I'm</font>

281
00:16:47,120 --> 00:17:00,740
sure I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the ice chairs have that</font>

282
00:16:52,189 --> 00:17:03,139
under control right all right yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

283
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,189
say we're confident that the reviews on

284
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:06,859
ice are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take longer that</font>

285
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:09,110
reviews on<font color="#CCCCCC"> stun bees I'm sorry at</font>

286
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:12,529
reviewing ice piece is gonna take longer

287
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:13,789
time reviewing Stumpy's so could<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

288
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,940
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not gonna be holding us</font>

289
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:20,260
back

290
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:22,540
alright so do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have anybody in this</font>

291
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,849
room actually that will sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> up as</font>

292
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,829
reviewers for ice piss while we're on

293
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,899
that topic given that if we don't get

294
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:41,080
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really going to go anywhere</font>

295
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">here Tex you volunteered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Collin do you</font>

296
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,460
volunteer is wrong are you here for

297
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:53,200
stunned is ok we got three other

298
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:56,470
volunteers in RTC web meeting the other

299
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,190
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> that agreed to review this thought</font>

300
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,750
the ice fish<font color="#CCCCCC"> squeals right what's up I</font>

301
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,820
don't know they're in the minutes we got

302
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,130
it was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Agnes ecker I guess is</font>

303
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,480
really far Ian Peter right so if you

304
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,100
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them know that would be good</font>

305
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,750
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it that is an issue that</font>

306
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,389
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> into here as well and</font>

307
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,010
their music I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're little short</font>

308
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,150
on reviewers at this point so that's I

309
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,710
said what we're going to be focusing on

310
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,630
in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> several slides here getting</font>

311
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,510
people signed up because otherwise again

312
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,980
we can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward any other</font>

313
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:27,660
comments on the overview here before we

314
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,660
move into the detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> on each of these</font>

315
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we I guess an important question</font>

316
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,020
for the RTC web folks do we have

317
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything covered here is anything</font>

318
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,230
missing

319
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:53,040
I common things like I guess my only

320
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,340
question is how far if you trace the

321
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,310
chains of dependences<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you some</font>

322
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,080
of these go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back several drafts depend</font>

323
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,740
on drafts dependent dress we have

324
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,139
checked everything that belongs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to M</font>

325
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,940
music and if it goes outside of em music

326
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we have checked with the working</font>

327
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,500
group chairs and authors of those drafts

328
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and ask them to say when is your draft</font>

329
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,670
ready we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not followed their</font>

330
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:20,550
dependencies we have perhaps incorrectly

331
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:23,130
but we have assumed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they understand</font>

332
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:25,350
their own dependencies and that seems

333
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,750
reasonable i mean i've just seen these

334
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,580
horrible graphs seven previous meetings

335
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">i just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> double check that you but</font>

336
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:43,620
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should make</font>

337
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:49,890
sure to double check on that I'm sorry

338
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:50,699
sayin microphone please Jonathan texted

339
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,470
me it seems there aren't very many

340
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,640
documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that music that are not on</font>

341
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,250
this slide and most of them are

342
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,360
obviously not artsy web dependencies so

343
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,580
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could sort of do it by process of</font>

344
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:10,290
elimination I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next slide</font>

345
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:13,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe um well there we are related to</font>

346
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:15,629
yeah but so yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

347
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,300
three are and then the previous slide

348
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:22,290
here I mean previous I to another

349
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:24,300
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> group items</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so and these</font>

350
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">are all affect them in the bottom second</font>

351
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,720
major bullet is all mouth stuff that's

352
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,240
are just about dependency that just

353
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,090
taking advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it I guess the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

354
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,010
two are as you said I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably if</font>

355
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,300
they're not in the citation chain that's

356
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,750
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> means a citation is busted</font>

357
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:42,330
somewhere that should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed um so you</font>

358
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:46,890
believe the DS<font color="#CCCCCC"> xud are dependencies as</font>

359
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:48,889
well these two turn offs for that

360
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,830
physics business to keep this right

361
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:55,020
which one which one is that your 4566

362
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:57,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">pursues st peters and probably data for</font>

363
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">deciding that I say again probably</font>

364
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,799
Jessup should be

365
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:04,049
that is probably rather than 40 dr. C 6

366
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:09,690
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is currently citing I suspect so</font>

367
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:10,980
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's important okay we'll</font>

368
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,630
figure out how much difference it makes

369
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,669
to cycle one versus the other data

370
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:18,179
channel sdp nag i suspect you recited

371
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:19,679
from sorry thank you data channel sdp

372
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:21,179
neg<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it should be</font>

373
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,580
cited for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our collab but presumably it</font>

374
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,409
should be somewhere question is whether

375
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,178
it's a critical dependency for the set

376
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:30,720
of deliverables that RT C Webb has right

377
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:33,539
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

378
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,559
is the floss track of which one is which

379
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:38,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">but that one's the one where that's</font>

380
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,210
doing the in-band st in band protocol to

381
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,940
see ya that's not an artist who after

382
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:44,250
fantasy all right and ok you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

383
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the question is whether gay Seth</font>

384
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,940
wants to site for the 66 bus or not is

385
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:52,740
the question then I guess it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

386
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:55,350
what change and if it's important yeah i

387
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,140
just checked the folded like the full

388
00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,000
cumulative normative stuff of WebRTC

389
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cite either of those</font>

390
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,750
currently and I guess we i mean i'd ask

391
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,750
what is it in 4566 that we need would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

392
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,809
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question yeah and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean we're</font>

393
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:15,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to put this stuff up right</font>

394
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,710
that's important and give that priority

395
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,750
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like there's any issue with</font>

396
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,630
4566 bits but there's only so many

397
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,610
cycles from everybody so if it's not

398
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,169
needed then it hasn't gotten a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

399
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,699
attention and that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

400
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:28,049
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not on the list it can get put on</font>

401
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list and then we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put some</font>

402
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:33,240
priority on it as well if that's

403
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:36,658
necessary rania than the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel is</font>

404
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,210
DP negotiation there's a the clue data

405
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:43,980
channel is the has no motive reference

406
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:50,630
for that one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's in I TF +</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Co is</font>

407
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:53,940
that an ITC web dependency though okay

408
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:57,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Colin Perkins 456 see this as I</font>

409
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,789
understand it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty small Delta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4</font>

410
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">5 6 6 yes and no I mean there's no</font>

411
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:04,500
grammar and everything right I mean it's

412
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,440
it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be completely compatible</font>

413
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,510
for what we're doing here and it's also

414
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,280
nearly done so i would suggest if it's

415
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:17,740
done in time we drop it in and if not

416
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:21,399
don't worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it right Ben Campbell</font>

417
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,600
when you you mentioned just<font color="#CCCCCC"> psycho</font>

418
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">starvation getting all this stuff</font>

419
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:28,179
through review and everything keep in

420
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,879
mind that depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on where the pins</font>

421
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,980
get pulled and things dislodge this can

422
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a big hairball going through the ietf</font>

428
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:54,670
example suggests that we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

429
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,840
drafts to publication<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests as soon</font>

430
00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:00,130
as possible to kind of spread it out

431
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really depends on the individual</font>

432
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:05,200

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,240
are mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> done that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably fine if</font>

434
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,500
there's dependencies where the reviewer

435
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,150
really needs to understand what's going

436
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:26,920
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's still in flux</font>

437
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:31,980
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not fine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

438
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:35,350
individual drafts and having some more

439
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,510
discussion on them we have the bundle

440
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,370
negotiation which is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spider in</font>

441
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,550
the web for many of these drafts that

442
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:46,780
has as was said the external

443
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:49,300
dependencies on on ice and on max

444
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,270
attributes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Max exclusive although</font>

445
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,520
the last two ones are in good shape

446
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:57,910
shouldn't be a problem we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

447
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:00,460
issues in the document itself it has

448
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:03,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">been recently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discussed on the lists</font>

449
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:07,300
that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially have a single</font>

RTP stream carrying multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> em IDs and</font>

451

that was disgusting on<font color="#CCCCCC"> apt core no no no</font>

452
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,700
no no this is the single note he said it

453
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:21,220
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so Charles Linux that was the</font>

454
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,840
issue I raised I did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> intend this to</font>

455
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,880
be a blocker for bundle I intended this

456
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,320
to be a potential future extension to

457
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,509
bundle

458
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,389
I do not think this I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

459
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:34,350
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is as you say the</font>

00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:35,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">linchpin for most of most of our to see</font>

461

462
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:40,259
would be fairly would be require some

463
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,360
fairly new work I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

464
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:45,779
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that would be</font>

465
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,699
bucking bundle itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay second point</font>

466
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,250
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just it which is also what</font>

467
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,409
I raised that one is you know purely

468
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,419
mechanical changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> other that our</font>

469
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:56,100
registrations and references work that

470
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,799
should be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> second bullet legit the</font>

471
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:04,350
referencing ABT xed SS header X that's

472
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:06,750
mechanical and easy yeah Colin plugins

473
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:09,209
the the multiple myths thing changes

474
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:11,129
rtcp in a way which you need I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

475
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,320
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of discussion so I I would</font>

476
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:15,629
have most just avoiding that at this

477
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,299
point if we can if it's possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

478
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:20,299
leave it to a future extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

479
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:27,529
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> except for those two points</font>

480
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:32,580
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's only some minor nits</font>

481
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:36,000
identified by Fleming so next steps then

482
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,820
would be to update the document

483
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,259
accordingly assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't take</font>

484
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:47,100
in this multiple mid issue at all fix

485
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:52,980
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> nits and we will have the working</font>

486
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:56,158
group loop lost call finalized choose

487
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,899
one question for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Krista so is it clear</font>

488
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,029
to you Krista what needs to be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

489
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:02,100
the second bullet because there were

490
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:04,379
some emails floating around suggesting

491
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,969
that somebody else would come up with

492
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:13,289
tech suggestions for what you get

493
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:15,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">dropped in there Krista it was initially</font>

494
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:17,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little unclear exactly what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it</font>

495
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it's an editorial task it was a</font>

496
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,909
little difficult for me to figure out

497
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:25,289
how exactly to do it but then then I I

498
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:27,539
had some other things which I had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

499
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:28,860
for for this meeting so I also informed

500
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:30,990
you that I will not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

501
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,000
for Berlin so i will go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

502
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:35,879
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at it as well i was on</font>

503
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,830
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to me yeah i think it's but</font>

504
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:39,059
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i keep hearing is just an</font>

505
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,860
administrative thing but

506
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,899
there are those obvious to me when I

507
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,149
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it so i will keep in touch</font>

508
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:46,949
with the people so we get it done<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

509
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:49,018
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an issue I mean</font>

510
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:56,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so Jonathan you can help out with</font>

511
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:59,549
that from Agnes well I accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

512
00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:01,620
modification a little covering up hope

513
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:09,240
you get this I mean if you want to just

514
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:10,678
beat up quickly after<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does gonna</font>

515
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,179
get people<font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can just just meet</font>

516
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,119
up quickly after this people are

517
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:18,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">available and just talk it over that</font>

518
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:23,459
would be great<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian madness or</font>

519
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:30,990
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but not least who</font>

520
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:33,389
volunteers to do one final review Krista

521
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,220
I think it's important here to remember

522
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:37,918
this was not the first working<font color="#CCCCCC"> applause</font>

523
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,499
go we've had we've had this was at lea

524
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,869
second i believe working group last call

525
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:45,330
we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hope that is way more</font>

526
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:48,990
interested in this draft have reviewed

527
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:52,049
it every time someone has reviewed it

528
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:54,389
it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's and a lot of the</font>

529
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:57,899
reviews have been regarding it editorial

530
00:28:54,389 --> 00:29:02,369
issues and most of the times i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

531
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:04,199
rewrite la many things in the document

532
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:07,350
it's just not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it changed this</font>

533
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,149
sentence and the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when</font>

534
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,100
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives the comment or have a game</font>

535
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:12,959
in a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> i understand people who are</font>

536
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,330
busy but I'm just saying what's you know

537
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,639
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem here other people who</font>

538
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,139
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested they don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

539
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:21,449
about those comments that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> given by</font>

540
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:23,399
someone else so then I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay are we</font>

541
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,769
okay with these changes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I you</font>

542
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:27,508
know no one says anything I submit the

543
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:29,340
new version and the next person<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes</font>

544
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:31,049
along and reduce it and say you know I

545
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,959
don't like this editorial change and

546
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:35,369
sometimes he or she asked to change back

547
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,809
to what it was previously so it would

548
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:38,850
really be good at anyone who's

549
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,619
interested when someone gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one</font>

550
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,199
else gives comments take a look at those

551
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:44,850
and participate in the discussions

552
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,460
because otherwise is going forth and

553
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,719
back and forth and back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and eights and</font>

554
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,119
eventually even though I try to cover

555
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,310
everything every time you do that kind

556
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,919
of rewrite

557
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,780
there's a big chance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> messing up</font>

558
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,000
forgetting something and and mess up

559
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,620
things so so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I I agree</font>

560
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,640
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> Krista and I don't mean that</font>

561
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,169
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be working group last</font>

562
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,610
calling the entire document again and

563
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:07,640
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to review and change</font>

564
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything the challenge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

565
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,210
as a chair we have sometimes is when we

566
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,919
do the publication recurs write-ups

567
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,840
right you know we ask people who have

568
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,340
reviewed this document and even if you

569
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,780
didn't find anything just say that

570
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,449
you've you didn't you're okay with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we</font>

571
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,490
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in response right so it's hard</font>

572
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">to indicate you know Solly consensus on</font>

573
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,670
those documents it's just a challenge

574
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,889
from an affinity to point of view yes

575
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:30,290
and Krista and I also want don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

576
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,680
get I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really want people to review</font>

577
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:36,950
this right but I would hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at this</font>

578
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,080
point we we are ok with the editorial

579
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:43,070
structure of a document and we focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

580
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,449
bugs and errors that would mean if

581
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone comes to say no I don't like</font>

582
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,120
this word we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should use this word</font>

583
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,400
throughout the documents you know I'm

584
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,080
gonna say no yeah and we've had so many

585
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,360
working group last call's that I mean

586
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,710
we're not gonna agree to that either for

587
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,000
sure just let's just push back on

588
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:05,030
editorial changes like if it's not

589
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:06,740
broken and we are too late<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the stage</font>

590
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,840
to write it to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comprehensible of</font>

591
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,210
his in conference it is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is at</font>

592
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,510
this point it's comprehensible it is

593
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:16,820
comprehensible it is not the most easily

594
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:18,740
understood document but i agree with

595
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">colin we have passed that point i mean</font>

596
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:35,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you want to see any of this stuff</font>

597
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:41,180
move forward or past that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">older leading said alyssa cooper other</font>

599
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,300
people who are not in this working group

600
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,440
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have to read this document</font>

601
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,909
like 14 other area directors so like I

602
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,100
understand that you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to change</font>

603
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,990
all of it but like it has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

604
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,730
some bar so that somebody who is

605
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,740
completely unfamiliar with this can read

606
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,080
it otherwise it's just me stuck in IHC

607
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:03,560
evaluation waiting for that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get fixed</font>

608
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,800
it is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not arguing for any larger</font>

609
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,850
small changes but

610
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,830
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you can just be like oh</font>

611
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,629
if if if we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this work done</font>

612
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,310
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go because there's like</font>

613
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,350
another step that the end it at some

614
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:15,149
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean quite frankly you know the</font>

editor primary author has been bending

over backwards to address comments and

617
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,310
gone through<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I'm working</font>

618
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,419
group last call's at some point you got

619
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,010
to say there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough of an</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity for everybody's a comment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

621
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:33,510
it and get their editorials in and I

622
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have passed that point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Perkins I mean it's that this draft is</font>

624
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,180
complicated enough that whatever we do

625
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,610
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find some bugs with it</font>

626
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:44,130
later so it may be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case of it's good</font>

627
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,020
enough ship it open the best draft and

628
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:48,390
just let a trundle trundle trundle and

629
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,800
gradually accumulate fixes because you

630
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,510
something this big is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to be</font>

perfect however much we try at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

not producer reading it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's one</font>

641
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,800
one of those who gave comments early and

642
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,420
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I try to incorporate your your</font>

comment including the purity of

644
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:43,170
editorial once you had so I'm sorry for

645
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:48,420
that but no no that was not my intention

646
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I appreciate the comments yet so no then</font>

campbell let's not get too wrapped

648
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:54,870
around hypotheticals but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say you</font>

649
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,640
know if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have trouble</font>

650
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,709
reading these comments take the comments

651
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,960
then figure out what to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the</font>

652
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:03,240
answer may be that it doesn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font>

653
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:08,010
to do that the answer may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be oh yes you</font>

654
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">found something important just because</font>

655
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,040
you have comments doesn't mean you have

656
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:14,630
to agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a mark don't have to you</font>

know follow every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of them</font>

658
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:41,009
okay next I saw Magnus<font color="#E5E5E5"> and column</font>

659
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:51,089
raising their hands reviewing the bundle

draft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Iker thank you and we will</font>

661
00:34:51,089 --> 00:35:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">also go to the next draft then a music</font>

yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> referenced in the draft but it will</font>

be max attributes and tsv working group

667
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:35,160
previously had an issue with detail ssdp

00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:37,440
needing to be stable<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order to</font>

669
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:42,118
progress this but this seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

670
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,890
pretty much achieved so according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

671
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,329
chairs understanding there should be no

672
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:52,410
further technical issues with the

673
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:57,440
document so it needs reviews basically

674
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:57,440
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're saying on this slide</font>

676
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,700
is people don't spend time now and

677
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:10,020
review the current version because there

678
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:12,930
will be changes due to this dtl assisted

679
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,430
be so I you know if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want</font>

680
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,680
to review<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I'm sure they found</font>

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet you know read bundle but</font>

682
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:25,319
anyway no I think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

683
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:27,540
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this and Roman also have</font>

694
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:07,760
was just one little strange comment

695
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:09,890
saying we should cover everything but or

696
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,369
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how</font>

things up because i don't remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

699

from my head exactly where the issues

00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:22,640
are but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something we should</font>

you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about or if something thing in</font>

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,359
someone is doing in detail s over s ATP

703

continually split it up but no one

indicated they are aware of anyone doing

709
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,439
that so but I may be wrong just just you

710
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:46,609
know doing some brainstorming on how we

711
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:48,200
can you know speed up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> drug we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

712
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:50,480
put the question in the room is there

713
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,078
anyone in here that is interested in

714
00:37:50,480 --> 00:38:02,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">ttls over sctp to get some guidance to</font>

715
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:07,039
Christine does not seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so in case</font>

716
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:09,470
you find issues it seems the working

717
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:15,140
group in this room is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with with</font>

718
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:17,149
leaving those aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jonathan x I'm</font>

719
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,609
inai also be concerned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if nobody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

720
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,020
using it or planning to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

721
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how good a review we're going to</font>

722
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:26,000
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it actually meets</font>

723
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:34,649
the hits fit for purpose if you don't

724
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:36,120
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purpose is so</font>

725
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Krista could you just send an email to</font>

726
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,529
the list as well I will do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

727
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:42,840
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment that when when Roman and I</font>

728
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,360
discussed it is actually quite funny

729
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:48,060
because Roman find I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> bugs in the</font>

730
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:51,780
actual transport working group documents

731
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:54,120
and I think he discussed those with

732
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,210
those people but it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah let's</font>

733
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">even not really bad by things that not</font>

734
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:01,710
really need to be that as they are so we

735
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,780
are not I mean they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

736
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">update the documents we will align to</font>

737
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,620
that maybe we will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> note this</font>

738
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">is why we do this because you know it's</font>

739
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,279
to be aligned<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those transport</font>

740
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,410
documents I don't remember the details

741
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:29,190
they have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport level</font>

742
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:32,609
specific so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will ask to the list then</font>

743
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:34,320
about reviewers and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> christer said it</font>

744
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:36,120
does not seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the very first</font>

745
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,510
priority we have other documents that

746
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:43,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">more important push this one a bit lower</font>

747
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:48,420
down on the list so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next document we</font>

748
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:49,950
have here is the ice zip sdp where we

749
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:56,070
have normally depend on motive

750
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:59,810
dependency on ice base and we have an 09

751
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:06,270
version that should address all

752
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:08,040
identified open items meaning that we

753
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:12,020
could take this to working group last

754
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:16,440
call as soon as ice base is ready for

755
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:19,200
working group last call and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

756
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,220
here have a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that has</font>

757
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,230
volunteered<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read review actually I</font>

758
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:29,580
think they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been volunteered to</font>

759
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:31,200
review so i don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if some how many</font>

760
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:34,560
do you have in a room so Krista is

761
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,830
obviously here<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam is here roman is</font>

762
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,930
roman here no Thomas I don't believe

763
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:43,480
Thomas is here you go

764
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:50,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">christer can we sign you up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Adam</font>

765
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:52,420
can we sign you up thank you yes can we

766
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:59,980
get anybody else's to volunteer in the

767
00:40:52,420 --> 00:41:01,600
room<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so Krista and Adam for</font>

768
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:05,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">now and we'll contact roman and matt</font>

769
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">thomas as well and we'll send you know</font>

770
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:23,140
next draft is trickle ice sip where we

771
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:27,339
also have dependencies on<font color="#E5E5E5"> trick lines I</font>

772
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:32,049
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seep stp max exclusive bundle</font>

773
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:36,040
and Max attributes it seems there are no

774
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:38,410
open issues in the document next step

775
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:41,350
would be to include the latest review

776
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:46,210
comments from<font color="#CCCCCC"> christer and post another</font>

777
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:52,299
version so expected completion date of

778
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:56,050
this would be a very very soon ready for

779
00:41:52,300 --> 00:42:00,760
working group last call and candidates

780
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:06,310
for review could be porque svet<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jonathan</font>

781
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:09,220
possibly Simon marching<font color="#CCCCCC"> sue has and Adam</font>

782
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:13,650
and those we have in the room can we

783
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:13,649
have some indication Adam Thank You

784
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:34,810
Jonathan thank you yes you won't tell

785
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:41,680
sue us<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is Paul signing</font>

786
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:46,070
up then I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the base lack of rapid</font>

787
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:49,730
it's nice I'm sorry

788
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:57,040
again little<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower volume I beg off</font>

789
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:57,040
because I lack confidence about ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

790
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,750
so Martin I see you hiding back there

791
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:10,580
yeah I beg off on lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time I think</font>

792
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:14,570
you probably have enough coverage with

793
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:20,049
this descent without my relative lack of

794
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:20,050
knowledge on<font color="#CCCCCC"> sip hurting you there okay</font>

795
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:40,610
so next documents having both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

796
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:43,790
two related drafts in one slide they are

797
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:47,870
in working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call currently and</font>

798
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:51,770
we need reviews the working group last

799
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:56,000
call is in progress and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have I</font>

800
00:43:51,770 --> 00:44:05,780
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> some comments so far review</font>

801
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:09,490
comments from Magnus do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

802
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,490
more volunteers to review these two

803
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,670
Jonathan thank you and Peter thank you

804
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:33,350
and that's on both documents right Peter

805
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:47,750
as well both documents thank you can we

806
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:48,920
get one more person yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

807
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,900
bowl you're going to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same range</font>

808
00:44:48,920 --> 00:45:03,650
yeah all right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

809
00:44:52,900 --> 00:45:06,710
thank you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we do have a separate</font>

810
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:14,750
slide for the rid draft that was sent to

811
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:16,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">us by Adam so a lot of this is just this</font>

812
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,500
is adam<font color="#E5E5E5"> richard a lot of this is just to</font>

813
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,540
put the changes in front of the room

814
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,430
make sure no one has<font color="#E5E5E5"> any objections what</font>

815
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,860
was done if Magnus sent a very detailed

816
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:27,259
preview I appreciate that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

817
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:29,240
a couple of issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were raised I</font>

818
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,590
think we probably want to have some

819
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,149
amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discussion on I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

820
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we could just come to consensus on</font>

821
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,850
them real quick here in the room

822
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:38,630
otherwise you can take him back to the

823
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:41,509
list so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one was that there</font>

824
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:45,100
were a few changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Magnus Adam to</font>

825
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:45,100
want to stand out what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been one I</font>

826
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:53,510
can't read<font color="#CCCCCC"> this live from down here so</font>

827
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,700
the first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Magnus suggested a</font>

828
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:58,370
number of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would need to</font>

829
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:03,259
do to clean up our use for declarative

830
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:05,480
use of rib now we had had it in their

831
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,510
original it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind of a we don't see</font>

832
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">in use cases for this but if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just can</font>

833
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,040
describe with relatively little effort

834
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,090
how this works then it's kind of nice

835
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,170
because it means if someone comes up

836
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,220
with these case in the future they don't

837
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:19,640
have to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work for it they</font>

838
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,089
can just use it it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking like we</font>

839
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,069
might be

840
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:24,820
to put significantly more definition

841
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:27,530
around declarative use with rid and

842
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:29,500
based on that my inclination would be to

843
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:31,990
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font>

844
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,730
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have text in there that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> says</font>

845
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:36,259
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying it's disallowed but</font>

846
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:39,740
we're not defining what it means here

847
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,420
and if some future use case arises that

848
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,700
needs to use rid in a declarative

849
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:46,460
context there can be an additional

850
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,689
document that defines that so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

851
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of throw that out of the room and</font>

852
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:55,970
see if that's that's something that

853
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:58,190
people would be happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> with mine is</font>

854
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,290
Estlin yeah I I don't think at the time

855
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:02,390
to actually proposed text otherwise I

856
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,340
would have if I had the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peruse</font>

857
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:05,990
text I'm probably saying that I would

858
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to keep it keep it there but I</font>

859
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:12,859
think for a moment yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm finally</font>

860
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:14,750
pulling it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so jenny one does</font>

861
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,550
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else have a comment is they don't</font>

862
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,900
object does anyone have any use cases

863
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:23,330
they want to put forth where this would

864
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:25,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">be useful on a declarative context all</font>

865
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:27,319
right texture of the draw documental go

866
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:30,200
ahead and pull that out then modulo

867
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:33,920
discussion on the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> I suppose and the</font>

868
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:36,830
second one was something<font color="#E5E5E5"> Magnus pointed</font>

869
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,680
out is that the items that were putting

870
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:41,390
in RTP and rtcp can be arbitrary utf-8

871
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,149
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of the way that these</font>

872
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:46,040
items tend to be defined and at the same

873
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:48,110
time in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SDP we're defining the</font>

874
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:51,290
syntax<font color="#E5E5E5"> for rid to be fairly narrowly</font>

875
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:55,340
scope right now it says alphanumeric we

876
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:56,900
also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a suggested means of producing</font>

877
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,330
these things is basically just start

878
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,570
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and go up for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> purposes of</font>

879
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:04,750
both being small and being something

880
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:06,320
that doesn't uniquely identify

881
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,580
implementations when they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

882
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,660
be identified basically everyone's

883
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:13,670
generating these the same way then

884
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:15,799
everyone kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looks the same so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> based</font>

885
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:17,810
on that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see the need to be able</font>

886
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,670
to put arbitrary utf-8 in here these

887
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:22,310
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantics associated with</font>

888
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:24,320
them other than this matches that so my

889
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:27,799
inclination there is to just leave it as

890
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:30,770
it is and say the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDP we're constraining</font>

891
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:33,770
in this way and that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there</font>

892
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:35,810
were some other use of the RTP

893
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:39,080
items that were more expansive than this

894
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:41,240
it wouldn't be precluded by the ABT

895
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,690
ex-red draft but there would be no way

896
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:46,879
to express it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> stp and so my</font>

897
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:50,530
inclination again is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave this the</font>

898
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,530
way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is presently in the document</font>

899
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:58,580
column Perkins s the I mean we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdp</font>

900
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,860
attributes that are utf-8 already<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

901
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:06,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't we just steal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their be</font>

902
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:09,680
enough from the the stp spec doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

903
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:11,540
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually so the specific example that</font>

904
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,910
was given included being able to put

905
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like spaces in here and and other</font>

906
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,000
things we're using as limiters but i

907
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:21,590
think is vaguely problem problematic I

908
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:26,570
think I think 4566 biss has a non white

909
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:28,490
space utf-8 a bamf thing defined so if

910
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,750
it's just how to specify it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

911
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">can just copy that definition from</font>

912
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,690
somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously if there's</font>

913
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:37,400
another reason for restricting it then

914
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:39,350
yet sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay gone gone are we going to</font>

915
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,940
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the many complicated</font>

916
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:45,710
ways to compare these and things too if

917
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:47,330
we do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is yeah</font>

918
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,920
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't actually a running freeing</font>

919
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,150
prep on this in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

920
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:58,310
we're pulling out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the package would</font>

921
00:49:50,150 --> 00:50:00,230
be a royal pain yeah look<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we really</font>

922
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:02,060
mean here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this binary string of</font>

923
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,830
bits in between things and like you know

924
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,210
as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> etfs we always get wrapped up with</font>

925
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:06,529
every time one of these we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make</font>

926
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,840
them utf-8 for reasons I don't

927
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:12,710
understand but it's just it's just a

928
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,420
binary identifier right<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cohen Perkins I</font>

929
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,580
mean that the reason to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it utf-8 is</font>

930
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:20,330
because it's also committed nest as item

931
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:22,490
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Estes specs as it is utf-8 well</font>

932
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:26,029
sure it also if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this also bites yeah I</font>

933
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:29,169
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean it's not an arbitrary</font>

934
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:34,700
sequence of bytes because it has to obey

935
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:36,260
utf-8 syntax show oh yeah sure and yep

936
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sorry what were you saying what's a</font>

937
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,910
works also a pesky is a subset of utf-8

938
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,470
so it's okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a ski can't be</font>

939
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,270
an arbitrary byte string because there

940
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:47,180
are some utf-8 sequences that are legal

941
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we do make it a ski then we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

942
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,348
make sure

943
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:52,760
the Dozen<font color="#CCCCCC"> avt draft as well right we</font>

944
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:55,310
need to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has the same</font>

945
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:58,640
restriction in it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just we would</font>

946
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:01,430
restrict<font color="#CCCCCC"> BS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> design</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to say this part</font>

947
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,210
must be utf-8 yes I'm so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I must be nasty</font>

948
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:07,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's get the esky subsets of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

949
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:09,950
it's any case what you think it is an

950
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:12,140
important in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind that we have the</font>

951
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:14,169
restrictions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the S design and be</font>

952
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:17,839
identical<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the trick shins in the SDV</font>

953
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:20,510
yeah i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if currently the estes item</font>

954
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:22,220
says this this can be utf-8 so if you

955
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:24,410
want to restrict it in sdp you also need

956
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">to restrict it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but okay I'm good with</font>

957
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:28,879
that so that just that implies a change

958
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:37,369
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red draft and on that do our</font>

959
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:39,290
problem making an alphanumeric that's

960
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:40,670
good i have this jonathan from the floor

961
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:43,279
was saying that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> technically you have</font>

962
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,869
to have it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vtx to that and send</font>

963
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that email to the list but i don't think</font>

964
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:51,650
anybody would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem with it</font>

965
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:53,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so Peter Thatcher I i was little</font>

966
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:58,040
unclear why can't the header extension

967
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:59,450
be a superset of this that's not clear

968
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,089
to me either but it also doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem</font>

969
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:03,609
like something worth arguing about

970
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:06,529
except<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's more work to go</font>

971
00:52:03,609 --> 00:52:08,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">changing jonalyn I think the argument is</font>

972
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:12,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know if you have if the</font>

973
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:15,140
identifiers are defined I mean in I

974
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,910
guess it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your theory of where</font>

975
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:18,078
the identifiers are coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

976
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parent is coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from st</font>

977
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:24,560
PMD push down towards the RTP stream

978
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,578
then obviously you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be set</font>

979
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,680
to whatever your<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think of them as</font>

980
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:32,569
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> generated by the RTP level and be</font>

981
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,799
pushed up to sdp then if it did your

982
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:36,170
implementation is your implementation

983
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,640
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if you</font>

984
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:38,990
know if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that way maybe</font>

985
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,640
so maybe your gateway from somebody else

986
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:48,919
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> using grid but not using ftp i don't</font>

987
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:50,210
know so in that case if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's real</font>

988
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,329
quick peter is this a practical

989
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:55,220
objection or a theoretical one it feels

990
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:57,109
highly theoretical and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work you're</font>

991
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,520
talking about the extra work its work I

992
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:59,900
have to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm willing to do and</font>

993
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,580
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just copying this Ted</font>

994
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,600
this text

995
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,250
the one document put it in the other

996
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,589
document yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

997
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:07,360
red draft is the a vtx draft is

998
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:08,800
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really done it's gonna</font>

999
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,120
have to be rubbed after the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg gets</font>

1000
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,740
their hands on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm by the way</font>

1001
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:17,230
just so it's clear this match is exactly

1002
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,970
the WebRTC which this has to be a

1003
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:21,220
superset of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Weber to see but they match</font>

exactly sir so what we see is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

ski or is it alphanumeric<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1006
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,690
alphanumeric okay that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1007
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:28,420
I ended up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from in the first</font>

1018
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft so basically in the slim</font>

1019
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,360
working group there have been questions

1020
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:34,090
have come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hang on once again Barry</font>

1021
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:39,090
got slides but we do have slides yes

1022
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:39,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay sure</font>

1023
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:03,920
yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically in the slim working</font>

1024
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:05,570
group we have had<font color="#E5E5E5"> some questions come up</font>

1025
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,480
about the interpretation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lang</font>

1026
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:12,590
attribute in 4566 this and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> gooner has</font>

1027
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,280
provided some slides here that

1028
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:19,700
articulate what the issues are and

1029
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,830
ideally we would have 4566 kind of

1030
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:29,919
clarify this so we understand exactly

1031
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:35,000
what it's supposed to do so basically um

1032
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:37,310
what the current slim draft is saying is

1033
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,560
interpreting it as saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

1034
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:43,100
declared languages must be used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1035
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:46,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">session but looking back at some of the</font>

1036
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:48,710
history it seems more likely that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1037
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:52,850
meant to be a negotiation with a list

1038
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:56,150
with with a selection but so we would

1039
00:55:52,850 --> 00:56:00,560
like clarification on that point there

1040
00:55:56,150 --> 00:56:02,510
is some wording changes in 4566<font color="#E5E5E5"> biss to</font>

1041
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,100
reflect this I think making<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more</font>

1042
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:08,150
clear that it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> selection and not</font>

1043
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:11,480
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Clara tough and you can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1044
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:13,520
differences if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the diff but</font>

1045
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is whether we need a little</font>

1046
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more clarification to really make it</font>

1047
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfectly clear about what's supposed to</font>

1048
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:27,529
happen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1049
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:33,200
proposal from a goon are about the

1050
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:34,730
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he'd like to see and I'm</font>

1051
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">just trying to look here what the change</font>

1052
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:41,390
is yeah so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the changes here is</font>

1053
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he makes it clear that the</font>

1054
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:46,549
intention is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to select one language</font>

1055
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,960
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what would also be helpful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1056
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:50,300
people in this room have implemented

1057
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:53,990
this and can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us what they did that</font>

1058
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:55,340
would also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> helpful because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1059
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we've been able to find a lot of</font>

1060
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:59,980
folks who done it

1061
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:04,220
so that's basically the change that he's

1062
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:06,830
submitting and basically also clarifying

1063
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,299
the assumption here that one of the

1064
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:10,190
declared languages should be selected

1065
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">and used and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't reflect</font>

1066
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:19,790
that speaking multiple languages at once

1067
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:23,000
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so he is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically i believe</font>

1068
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:24,830
posted to the left correct and so if

1069
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,260
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something you've implemented</font>

1070
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:29,060
please respond back to them and give

1071
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:39,380
your opinion as to whether these changes

1072
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:41,630
make sense thank you so with that we

1073
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:47,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have any more items on the agenda</font>

1074
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:50,150
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> still have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like seven</font>

1075
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:52,069
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> less left of the session and I</font>

1076
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:54,500
seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember I'm looking at the RTC</font>

1077
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:58,030
web chair you had a discussion in the

1078
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:06,290
RTC web working group about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> SDP</font>

1079
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:08,690
attributes<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi so just very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly on</font>

1080
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:10,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> language stuff that the text in</font>

1081
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:13,520
there has survived essentially unchanged

1082
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:18,380
was that wording about Hortense since

1083
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:20,390
draft I TFM music<font color="#CCCCCC"> SD p.05 the very first</font>

1084
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:23,120
draft educated and it hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed</font>

1085
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:24,680
ever since then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I suspect it just hasn't</font>

1086
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:28,630
really been booked types like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark</font>

1087
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,629
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and hasn't been implemented</font>

1088
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:44,780
it's been there for 19 years do you want

1089
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:46,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put it on coming sure yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1090
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:49,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">six love the language text has been in</font>

1091
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:51,109
there since the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> n-bomb tools session</font>

1092
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,550
directory session announcement times and

1093
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">it hasn't changed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> since</font>

1094
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:23,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">great so we can just run through these</font>

1095
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,180
quickly since we have time I think we

1096
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:28,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">went through a bunch of these the other</font>

1097
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:30,580
night in last night and<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that</font>

1098
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,900
actually what this working group had

1099
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,549
done looked right and the other

1100
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:36,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">documents need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to match it so these were</font>

1101
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:43,660
issues where jasa our bundle didn't

1102
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:46,480
match and on like you know on this one

1103
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:50,740
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to read the slide</font>

1104
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:53,650
people i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proposed resolution</font>

1105
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:58,779
of this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make j sup match</font>

1106
00:59:53,650 --> 01:00:00,280
what bundle and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice sip sdp say that</font>

1107
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:04,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">seemed like a reasonable conclusion to</font>

1108
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:09,490
people and I've I given<font color="#CCCCCC"> you enough time</font>

1109
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:15,220
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read the slide okay I've gotten a</font>

1110
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:20,850
couple thumbs up we'll update jason sort

1111
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:23,500
of match this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this one I currently</font>

1112
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:25,870
do sit what's a fingerprint and all the

1113
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:28,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">M lines where the other the bundle</font>

1114
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:32,290
suggests that you don't need to do that

1115
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:35,200
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ecker had mentioned briefly that</font>

1116
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:36,610
well somebody had mentioned that the

1117
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">jace up once we're getting very long</font>

1118
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:41,860
anyway so I mean any anyone thinking we

1119
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:43,390
should change bundle here to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it put</font>

1120
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:51,610
it in every line versus just the first

1121
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:55,060
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mountain tell us we put the</font>

1122
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:57,400
transport primas only on those lines

1123
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,799
that made it and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

1124
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,800
transport primitive so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we we</font>

1125
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:06,730
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right advice in bundle and we</font>

1126
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:09,670
just need to tweak Jessup<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay only I</font>

1127
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:11,380
knew a chase a father so I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1128
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,640
memory that there are other places where

1129
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,560
we ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to be replicated</font>

1130
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,290
across some lines I don't throw that's

1131
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,910
true but I've summary of that so

1132
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:20,670
oh I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure we have</font>

1133
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:22,859
consensus that any my anything that is

1134
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything in jsf that says that you</font>

1135
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,980
should replicate stock are some lines

1136
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:28,470
that is identical across my dilemma is

1137
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,940
identical should be removed it's

1138
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:33,980
anything that's the transport category

1139
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:37,560
in the mock draft should be removed uh

1140
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:39,090
okay um sure i'm happy to create that

1141
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,870
might be the same as everything that's

1142
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:44,540
replicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just not sure yeah so</font>

1143
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:46,200
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1144
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:49,830
recommendation here is anything on the

1145
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:55,250
transport thing is replicated across non

1146
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:58,920
bundle only lines isn't it or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1147
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:01,610
insist on whatever bundle says is yeah

1148
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:04,920
you think correct run along yeah yeah

1149
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:06,540
but clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> joseph is is missed</font>

1150
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:09,810
something and it's just it needs to be

1151
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:11,430
corrected not removed right I think we

1152
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:13,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">just have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few tweaks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at JCP artwork</font>

1153
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:14,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">was yeah maybe in sync with a previous</font>

1154
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:20,189
version a bundle or something all right

1155
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,990
i mean just just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment in general we</font>

1156
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,750
need I don't know exactly from where

1157
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:27,930
this is copy debug but we need to

1158
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:29,610
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bundle separates on the</font>

1159
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:31,169
initial offer when you don't yet know

1160
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:32,400
whether bundles going to be there

1161
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:34,980
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to pay backward</font>

1162
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,630
compatible so you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prop so you</font>

1163
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:38,640
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in my search stuff</font>

1164
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:41,160
everywhere except in bundle only but

1165
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:43,859
once you negotiate the bundle group then

1166
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:47,940
you can start also<font color="#CCCCCC"> putting it removing</font>

1167
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:49,170
it from everyone but one and actually

1168
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chris tree would you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be willing to do a</font>

1169
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:53,220
really careful review of Jessup just for

1170
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> button how it did like whether we</font>

1171
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the bundle right that'd be really</font>

1172
01:02:54,990 --> 01:03:00,000
good I will do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but do you want me</font>

1173
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:03,390
to wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our new version no just do</font>

1174
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">it okay yeah justjust and send PRS or</font>

1175
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:08,040
issues like we'll need emails on the

1176
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:12,029
list just bugs right you know how to use

1177
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:13,860
github<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to clarify the direction</font>

1178
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:17,010
direction that we're getting adjacent

1179
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:19,530
others is to is to follow what it says

1180
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:21,000
them in point to here for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

1181
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:22,800
thing in the identical transport

1182
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,060
category and if I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying else's not</font>

1183
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,800
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> night side of the a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yugo</font>

1184
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:28,130
cigarette I fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I don't to come back</font>

1185
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:31,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well yeah yeah okay</font>

1186
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:32,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes um sometimes unless you read bundle</font>

1187
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,680
and decide that you think hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1188
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:41,710
wrong in which case<font color="#CCCCCC"> n fella it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1189
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:41,710
right yeah yes it's been wet polished uh

1190
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:53,690
and this one we're going to I guess

1191
01:03:50,210 --> 01:04:03,860
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move the web RTC stuff to</font>

1192
01:03:53,690 --> 01:04:08,870
reference I space that's it yes so thank

1193
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:11,120
you by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have no further topics on</font>

1194
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:12,740
the agenda unless we have all any other

1195
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:15,380
business and I see Magnus by the

1196
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:20,930
microphone yeah so I have another

1197
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:23,390
business app so one thing relating to

1198
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:25,040
you the site simulcast draft is that

1199
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:27,009
I've gotten quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of questions</font>

1200
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">around which is actually in EVT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> core</font>

1201
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:31,190
it's the intersection between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1202
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:34,580
simulcast stp descriptions and what's

1203
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:36,320
happening on the RTP level<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's so</font>

1204
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:38,870
it I think it's primarily something

1205
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,730
which it's directly related to david

1206
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:45,130
core and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual data plane to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1207
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:47,960
side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packets but it's how</font>

1208
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:50,840
simulcasting<font color="#CCCCCC"> read looks downstream from</font>

1209
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:52,820
an RTP mailbox towards the receiver<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1210
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,800
there seems to be some confusion about

1211
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:59,000
what the options are etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to</font>

1212
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:01,280
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> implemented so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I've I kind of</font>

1213
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,600
volunteered me in both to actually at

1214
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:07,550
least write a overview document on

1215
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:09,710
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here's what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is</font>

1216
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:12,050
happening it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a possible to</font>

1217
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:14,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen and then i will see if people</font>

1218
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:19,220
froze up on that or thinks that means

1219
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:21,620
this is dumb scoped or anything but so

1220
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:23,839
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a question of if you</font>

1221
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an SF you or not to be mixed model</font>

1222
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:28,070
etc will<font color="#E5E5E5"> i see is slightly different</font>

1223
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">behaviors when it comes to our way the</font>

1224
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:34,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">mids shows up in regards to the sources</font>

1225
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:36,410
truck complex and this is also is

1226
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,850
related to the fight we just head and

1227
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:40,310
perk which i think is you missed but

1228
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:41,930
yeah but yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of how</font>

1229
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:44,808
simulcast works in the various

1230
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:48,430
models and since there's a fight about

1231
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:48,430
which models<font color="#E5E5E5"> are applicable in Paris</font>

1232
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:55,578
would this draft be in a music or some

1233
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:58,460
other working group III considering its

1234
01:05:55,579 --> 01:06:00,380
yeah let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to write it first and</font>

1235
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:02,150
travels traffic will decide on one way

1236
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:05,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have the content of it because</font>

1237
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:12,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">it sits on the border between Ava decor</font>

1238
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:15,140
and music I would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> so thank you by</font>

1239
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:17,150
that I think we have unless there are

1240
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:19,098
further comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the microphone we</font>

1241
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:25,300
have concluded<font color="#E5E5E5"> a music session here at</font>

1242
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:25,300
ITF 96 thank you
