1
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:10,290
very good afternoon hope you can hear me

2
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,850
all right I i am i'll do my best I

3
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,520
really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like lecterns because it</font>

4
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:20,009
makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too normal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is an</font>

5
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,149
absolutely informal conversation so

6
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,430
first of all I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you for</font>

7
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">allowing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to spend some time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font>

8
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and share some some thoughts some</font>

9
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:36,440
experiences and I have some requests and

10
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:40,170
suggestions in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> order i hope i am</font>

11
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:45,360
i'm an interloper I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ietf member</font>

12
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:49,350
i have read our<font color="#E5E5E5"> seas of question rfcs</font>

13
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:54,990
and implement rfcs but that's the limit

14
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:59,250
of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF exposure I what I want to</font>

15
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">share with you is what I call a you know</font>

16
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,560
view from the field report from the

17
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:07,380
field I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security practitioner</font>

18
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,470
for quite some time but I say secured I

19
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,849
mean traditional cyber security but

20
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">before that then there wasn't before</font>

21
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:20,700
that I was deeply involved with

22
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,640
several engineering disciplines and as

23
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,579
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us especially those of us over</font>

24
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,049
40 we fell into networking we didn't

25
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,640
design we didn't desire to go into

26
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:34,530
networking so for the con for context

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,209
setting for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation let me</font>

28
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:47,459
tell you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about myself I am</font>

29
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:51,020
I started to read mark twain when I was

30
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">forced to in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jesuit High School so I</font>

32
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,750

33
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,709
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved with the internet truly</font>

34
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,330
the more I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> my dog and my dog does</font>

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,239
way is it chip and that ship is more

37
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,929
than just tracking it has all of her

38
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,390
health records it has her vaccination

39
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,440
schedule it has her likes and dislikes

40
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:24,149
for food and if i'm lucky i could not

41
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,049
actually track her too that's a

42
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:32,220
byproduct but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's it sets the tone</font>

43
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:34,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">for where we are today ietf is 30 years</font>

44
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,060
old and congratulations very few

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:43,350
organizations of any type can last 30

46
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:47,190
years 30 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I had just completed</font>

47
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,690
my first major sitter of series of

48
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,340
projects let me give a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

49
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,650
background my first job out of

50
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,269
university was at Argonne National

51
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,680
Laboratories now I didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

52
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,390
about nuclear physics I didn't know

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,860
anything about national battery testing

54
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,720
labs I don't know anything about much of

55
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,989
anything except<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a right good real</font>

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,940
time code and by real-time it meant it

57
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">was done it was not done in real time</font>

58
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,510
but those persistence that ran in<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

59
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:17,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and basically today we call these</font>

60
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:23,430
embedded systems so I'm from Cleveland

61
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:27,359
Ohio Midwest boy dried<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chicago and I go</font>

62
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the labs and big burly men with guns</font>

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,470
greet me and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking what am i</font>

64
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,270
doing what am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I getting</font>

65
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:42,420
to hear and as a escort me to my first

66
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:46,979
building there are these very short very

67
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:49,550
albino deer and I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> women I</font>

68
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,170
know they have nuclear stuff here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

69
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,130
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm thinking dear and seeing</font>

70
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,270
deer and something's not correlating and

71
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:01,260
I'm thinking what am I getting myself

72
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,599
into and then I meet the lab director

73
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,719
who was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> gracious and welcome the</font>

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,980
newcomer and said I know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the deer are you and it's not</font>

76
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,120
honestly yes sir it did cross my mind

77
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,489
goes don't worry they were bred this way

78
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,340
there from Switzerland and it was part

79
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:25,310
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deal for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the land grant for argon</font>

80
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:31,260
National Labs and I'm sticking to it so

81
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:32,610
my first job<font color="#E5E5E5"> was writing code for one of</font>

82
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,200
the reactors that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to had at</font>

83
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,850
times called the treat reaction thermal

84
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:41,760
test reactor and I wrote code for folks

85
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,400
who were far far smarter than I am in

86
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,280
fact several or up from the bill for the

87
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,979
Nobel years later but it was like a

88
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,690
Disneyland for nerds you know you could

89
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,060
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything everything you want it was</font>

90
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,150
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind of an</font>

91
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,240
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> but delivery and accuracy was</font>

92
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,070
critical so I wrote code for the treat

93
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,110
reactor to manage to collect the

94
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,390
kilometer which moved back and forth and

95
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> physicist can do their physics stuff</font>

96
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,289
or whatever and they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

97
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,720
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data game was correct and it</font>

98
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,880
was all that kind of nonsense so I did

99
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they were happy my boss was happy</font>

100
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,719
and nothing glowed so that was success

101
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:23,850
i'm good times right so back in the day

102
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,970
you know people play around the middle

103
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,810
of nuke reactor how quaint yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

104
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:33,060
guess then they decided for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the signs up</font>

105
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:37,290
so I cut my teeth on<font color="#CCCCCC"> real time systems</font>

106
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,669
and part of that was making not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the</font>

107
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">anode digital digital</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analog conversion</font>

108
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,359
is all my cell which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy but making</font>

109
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,460
systems that weren't meant to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

110
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">each other talk to each other that was</font>

111
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,930
my introduction to

112
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,580
working although we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

113
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,880
networking then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

114
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">plane not to use not to convert not to</font>

115
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,840
be confused with today's control playing

116
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,169
so about 25 years after i left this

117
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,310
program i ran across one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

118
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,799
departmental directors that retired i

119
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,820
was invited to his retirement he goes

120
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,610
you know Kevin they're still running

121
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:13,570
this the reactor with your code 25 years

122
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">later now this is in western Idaho so if</font>

123
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:19,120
you ever go to western Idaho don't I

124
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,330
would fly all around it to make sure

125
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Kevin's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 year old code is still</font>

126
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,698
running there somewhere on the reactor

127
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:31,000
but what I what I did realize was that i

128
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:35,320
liked the communications narrative<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,039
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was fun in a university i</font>

130
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:42,430
had instead of takin a spoken language<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

131
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">took Fortran and APL and it qualifies</font>

132
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:49,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">for fort fort language which was</font>

133
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:52,060
hilarious but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really enjoyed making</font>

134
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,389
things work that weren't meant to work

135
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:59,560
together so after argon<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ended up at a</font>

136
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:01,090
company who was subcontracted to do ddm

137
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,979
if you remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that defense data</font>

138
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:07,510
network then I MILNET separation and

139
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:10,780
then I really got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand and no</font>

140
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:13,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">networking the hard way in a classified</font>

141
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,210
environment with where time was a

142
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:18,609
commitment and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> notion of security</font>

143
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:25,210
was now introduced to me at a very young

144
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:27,820
as a very young engineer so in 1986 the

145
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:31,599
year I ATF was founded was an

146
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,740
interesting year for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things we</font>

147
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:38,529
had Top Gun I was awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool a</font>

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,990
Microsoft one Pablo and so the notorious

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:48,550
willyG became on his way to being a

150
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:50,950
billionaire we had the mat esky remember

<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple that the Macintosh gained</font>

153
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,060
credibility in business so it was a big

154
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,030
thing for some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us who were Apple</font>

155
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,459
devotees back in the day

156
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:07,959
and we had the internet looking

157
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like this and as I said I was</font>

158
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:15,580
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> DD had just come off working</font>

159
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:18,339
on DD n yep done and then I had moved to

160
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,300
this little<font color="#E5E5E5"> University on the East Bay</font>

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:25,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the San Francisco Bay Area some of</font>

162
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,219
you may have heard of it berkeley yeah

163
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,890
well if he knows all the universities to

164
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,600
the right are all<font color="#CCCCCC"> east coast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

165
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,430
they threw in a little carrot to

166
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">berkeley but i was working on bsd and</font>

167
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,800
among other things the sum of the bsd

168
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,290
stack came my way my team's way

169
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:48,069
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> bind and I always thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

170
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a terrible terrible name because it</font>

171
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,480
really put us in a bind everywhere from

172
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,190
where we're in a period who were<font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

173
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,380
the transitions from proprietary

174
00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:01,600
networks to of course tcp/ip base but it

175
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,640
was a learning experience but what I

176
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,650
took from that from my experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

177
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,970
prior especially under working on a DDM

178
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:16,540
was that we practitioners need to think

179
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:18,910
about a future state where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

180
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,099
everyone who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

181
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,319
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicating with us and associating</font>

182
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,510
with us we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't know them wasn't that</font>

183
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,200
we were so prescient that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> Porton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

184
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:31,930
we foresaw the collapse of 32-bit

185
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,970
address space not even close but we were

186
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,949
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 networks to</font>

187
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,460
30,000 networks in a very short period

188
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:42,580
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all they always want people that we</font>

189
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,330
knew they always weren't associations

190
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,500
that we knew we needed a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

191
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,990
so there were a group of us who kind of

192
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,870
banded together of course if you've been

193
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,220
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berkeley but the one of the great the</font>

Great artifacts of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> university of</font>

it gourmet ghetto I think there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

197
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">been at least 20 companies started on</font>

198
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,650
either on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Telegraph side or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

199
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,989
other side of campus but we would go and

200
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:10,150
just collaborate and say look what can

201
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,600
we do that's different what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

202
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,790
with the tools available or

203
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,449
by the way we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to write code so</font>

204
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:21,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can write new tools what could we do</font>

205
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:24,959
and we got shot it down we got a shadow

206
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:27,720
downs quite simply by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moat sand</font>

207
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">castle folks who simply said put a big</font>

208
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,540
barriers and move on we don't have time

209
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:36,449
so I share<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with you because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I look</font>

210
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:40,469
back now as a practitioner in which in

211
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:43,290
wish that I had the the temperament the

212
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,660
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the voice for that team</font>

213
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:49,050
then to have stood up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say no we need</font>

214
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,209
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this the right way now now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast</font>

215
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:54,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward I'm going to close out a little</font>

216
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:57,029

<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity and including multiple see</font>

so roles and a few startups successful

<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't so pleasant happened to noble by</font>

the largest in fact for those who are

go through the this afternoon's

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:13,399
discussion these were extremely

238
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:13,399
catastrophic events that were caused by

239
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:19,319
oversight under site just human error

240
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,010
both could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been avoided we know</font>

241
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:25,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in retrospect but they could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">been avoided</font>

243
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:32,339
that's what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna pause for that for</font>

244
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:34,740
now so after 18 years of running

00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,720
security teams just prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to joining</font>

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:47,490
Britain s as de permanently attacked I

249
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,100
had the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> where customers 200</font>

250
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,510
million customers came to me already

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,100
compromised but want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy things</font>

252
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,709
that's the real world that's amazon

253
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,949
that's us I mean them sorry Freudian

254
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:05,189
slip that's a companies who have to take

255
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:08,550
financial instruments with a username

256
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,290
and a password and then oh by the way I

257
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't care how strong your password is</font>

258
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,319
it doesn't matter when the key when the

259
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,110
keystroke logger has been on your

260
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer for the last two years i would</font>

261
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:25,620
get data dumps from the dark web

262
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:29,130
purveyors and it would start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

263
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:33,180
thousand credentials a week than 2,000

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:37,490
until hit a crescendo of 250,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique</font>

and oh by the way they have some great

267
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:45,119
passwords in there extremely good tech I

268
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:46,319
use one of them now that so good but

269
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,699
they were compromised so it doesn't

270
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:52,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter so how do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually conduct</font>

whether she's real or not well clearly

274
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,079
you have to use other analytic tools to

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,660
determine the buying behavior patterns

276

all the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stuck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,579
geolocation is not one of them it's

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:11,219
irrelevant but<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not you go</font>

just throwing out there it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,800
people think no stronger pass for

289
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,819
throwing their passwords and i can give

290
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,008
you all the strong pass what you want

291
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:42,939
it's irrelevant

292
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:48,850
so after practicing this wonderful fun

293
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:51,759
and um you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know low taxing occupation</font>

294
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,730
for 18 years figure what can we do to

295
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,439
change the internet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did what anyone</font>

296
00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:01,420
with a modicum of intelligence would do

297
00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:03,370
and as I ask Siri so as Siri how to

298
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,430
improve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interview</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet for</font>

299
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,540
security you know you can see some of

300
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,449
our answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

301
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful so if you know Syria you know</font>

302
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:13,569
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like Google search you</font>

303
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:18,870
have to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question in the right</font>

304
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:21,009
way so I try it again and that much help

305
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,410
so I figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what better place</font>

306
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:29,589
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to ask these questions then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF</font>

307
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:32,110
so here I am so a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of quick</font>

308
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,180
quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> right on history many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us in a</font>

309
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,149
room have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been there but some of us have</font>

310
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,500
not or may have intentionally forgotten

311
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:46,079
the in 1986 went the year in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITA founded</font>

312
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:48,790
there were zero known internet attacks 0

313
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,609
it's easy I mean this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trick</font>

314
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,139
question why but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all know it</font>

315
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,850
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really there yet was kind of their</font>

316
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:58,449
we're not quite there and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we all</font>

317
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,680
knew all 2,000 besides but in 88 we had

318
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:03,430
the person of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the Morris</font>

319
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,668
worm I was a cow still at a research

320
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:09,579
team and we got slammed with with the

321
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:12,610
Morris worm it was more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a more slug</font>

322
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:15,428
but but our machines were slow so worm

323
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:18,309
was fast enough but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that did was</font>

324
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that raise the consciousness of oh my</font>

325
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:22,869
god we really have to do something

326
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:27,669
because I'm not in control of my assets

327
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:29,379
I had I was between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bsd team and the</font>

328
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:31,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">acs which is academic commuter student</font>

329
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,179
team so the academic side<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had</font>

330
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,250
professors and in true nobel laureates

331
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,860
screaming at me from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> switzerland</font>

332
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,120
and from all parts of Europe saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

333
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't get to my system I can't get to my</font>

335
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:47,710
it's like dude chill before we said dude

336
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:51,039
chill I said we don't know what's going

337
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,580
on that was wake up moment for me and my

338
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,620
team

339
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,570
especially the folks who were riding a

340
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of the code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people were relying</font>

341
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,980
on we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what was going on we</font>

342
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,370
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wherewithal and the</font>

343
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,140
tools at the time to determine it so if

344
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,340
you read the Cuckoo's Nest know cliff

345
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,820
Stoll and all that kind of stuff you

346
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">know anybody who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would spend as much</font>

347
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,899
time as cliff to hit way through his

348
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,919
phone records probably needs a life but

349
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,600
we were trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what was</font>

350
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on in real time and I'm gonna tell</font>

351
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">you this was an eye-opening experience</font>

352
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,280
and one I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want I don't want to</font>

353
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,379
repeat because we no one knew and i

354
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,110
underscore that the NSF folks didn't

355
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,210
know we had context of IBM they didn't

356
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:34,090
know nobody really knew and on the first

357
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,070
day<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it was started but I bring this</font>

358
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,240
up because since then of course the

359
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:44,550
attacks have gotten far more

360
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:50,230
sophisticated far more a targeted and

361
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:52,350
far more effective so 2016 don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

362
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">worry about counting it's just insane</font>

363
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:58,510
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend their companies built on</font>

364
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,980
trying to calculate how much of the

365
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,420
impact there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on the internet from a</font>

366
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,330
taxes silly it's a specious to

367
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,630
suspicious serif descriptors for my

368
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,129
perspective because it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

369
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:14,410
the real number that<font color="#E5E5E5"> matters of how many</font>

370
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:17,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">our reaches of significance and the best</font>

371
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:19,090
estimates are around about one a week of

372
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,590
a significant personality<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I say this</font>

373
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:24,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">for authority i use to also be to see so</font>

374
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:25,870
at symantec in<font color="#E5E5E5"> iran one of the first</font>

375
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,470
research groups we had on on breach

376
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:31,659
detections so the consensus around those

377
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,230
who do this daily is as about of one a

378
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:43,300
week this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty plus a year of</font>

379
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:45,090
successful breaches so on the malware

380
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,550
side things are a little different

381
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:51,459
because frankly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pay me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to break</font>

382
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:53,950
in and oh by the way I used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

383
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:57,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">as well we we didn't use the term white</font>

384
00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:00,640
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> backing at hated that term but we</font>

385
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:04,510
were favorable hackers and I almost

386
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">always got in a layer seven in fact</font>

387
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:08,590
we never not got in there are few times

388
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,450
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got in through the plumbing by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit by</font>

389
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:13,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtue of looking at change control for</font>

390
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:16,060
example and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could through our</font>

391
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,760
reconnaissance we can tell most

392
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies we actually had a log now the</font>

393
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,010
bad guys in the dark net<font color="#CCCCCC"> Selat of when</font>

394
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,750
companies have their change control

395
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,270
JPMorgan Chase for example destroy a

396
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:31,240
name out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there if not necessary them</font>

397
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:34,600
tuesday at 7pm we knew it so tuesday

398
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:39,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 10pm is when we try our pens</font>

399
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:42,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">because guess what typically through a</font>

400
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,740
change control window mistakes are made

401
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:49,600
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was that was just the right time</font>

402
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:52,120
for fishing right so we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that until</font>

403
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,310
later<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven now having said that when</font>

404
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">people make mistakes on changes and</font>

405
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:59,620
change controls as usual was it was

406
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,600
either a deprecated or an older release

407
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,399
for example good one who's always a

408
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,110
person to everyone goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> right go for</font>

409
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,990
SNMP and DNS you just go right for that

410
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,389
is easy it's like know the slope gazelle

411
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when they when they made a mistake</font>

412
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,470
BAM wherein they don't know it we're

413
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting there it was just very very</font>

414
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">common fast forward today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lot</font>

415
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,900
harder because so much is also being

416
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:25,030
done in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud i'ma talk about that</font>

417
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,920
later but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud actually is a really</font>

418
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,750
great buffer from a security perspective

419
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:33,340
a very great buffer makes it a lot

420
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:37,830
harder now impossible so in 1986 there

421
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:41,409
were six confirmed well known viruses

422
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:43,030
because what happened was the folks who

423
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,860
were actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> collecting the viruses</font>

424
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,320
first of all were doing sneakernet

425
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,449
that's the only way of really doing it

426
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,899
it was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to transfer</font>

427
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:55,380
viruses other than physical media and

428
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:59,020
the virus<font color="#CCCCCC"> riders were basically</font>

429
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,730

there's a pause and they said yes we're

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:32,539
air-gapped but still they still use of

autonomous driving software is going to

511
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,740
have problems unfortunately someone did

512
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:14,480
die now that person probably shouldn't

513
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,070
have a should have been taking pin more

attention for I understand without

a practitioner because what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we do</font>

this better so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't happen or</font>

2010 was a pivotal year a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter who did it it happened</font>

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:06,870
code was expunged I mean was I'm sorry

same attack happened to me and a couple

00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:21,240
of other companies but we didn't share

537
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,310
we could have prevented it had there

been mechanism to make some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:30,950
changes it didn't happen so we're came

540
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:36,900
back five years later far more effective

541
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:40,110
we also had a couple of we had stuff

542

sent right well Stuxnet forever changed

as well both holes in around two

thousand ten the reason why they were so

548
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:56,540
impactful because now they're showing

549
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,540
that i can do destruction on equipment

just destroyed 30,000 pcs which was

motivated some are financially motivated

559
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,600
someone just motivated but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact is</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why I brought this point up</font>

589
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,420
was because actually again happened to

603
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:32,090
here are some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my observations number</font>

604
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:36,590
one from a cyber security perspective is

605
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:38,179
that hygiene is still appalling this is

606
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:41,300
nothing that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can necessarily address</font>

607
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,010
from IETF perspective the masterís<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

608
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,560
believe there are some of the talk about

609
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:50,570
some suggestions that I have but the

610
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:54,110
loop the need for companies to do a

611
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:56,480
better job is acute and there are

612
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:59,389
reasons why we don't for example if you

613
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,890
ask a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIO how many applications she has</font>

614
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:07,550
in her portfolio well over a thousand

615
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:09,860
some 20 22 years old<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it's</font>

616
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:11,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">just not easy to refresh that</font>

617
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,850
so they're a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their their</font>

618
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:15,080
mitigating rationale for some of the

619
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,480
hygiene probably hiding problem is the

620
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:22,159
biggest one because again is an attacker

621
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:27,799
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get in poor designs poor</font>

622
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:32,799
procedures and horrific<font color="#CCCCCC"> coding again</font>

623
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:35,929
that's how I get in automation is

624
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:38,600
something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a lot about on the</font>

625
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:41,630
operation site and do very very little

626
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it but the one of the reasons why</font>

627
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:47,750
we don't do a lot of more automation is

628
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:49,910
because it's hard it's extremely<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

629
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:53,510
and we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> automation on systems</font>

630
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:58,059
that weren't designed to be automated so

631
00:31:53,510 --> 00:32:01,280
you see lots and lots of Python writers

632
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:05,149
lots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of Python scripts trying</font>

633
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,190
to do things that are adding very

634
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:12,559
inadequate band-aids to a very

635

we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address but I don't hear</font>

639
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:35,590

way that a thousand plus applications

that the CIO is struggling with ask

648

<font color="#E5E5E5">from a cyber security perspective this</font>

657
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:32,010
count them 40 different products and so

658
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,570
what I asked my last two teams to do was

659
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,730
tell me where you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending your time</font>

660
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,559
not that I'm micromanage just want to

661
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:39,410
know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we came up with forty two</font>

662
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:42,809
percent of the time in my last order was

663
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:45,299
managing the management plane that's

665
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:51,750
that's insane totally insane but yet

666
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:54,720
that's what so many organizations are

667

716
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,560
understand that we have to understand

717
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:22,990
that someone decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw this up</font>

718
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awarding to the user that a you may</font>

720
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:30,250
whatever I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get over there this is</font>

721
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,690
what we are dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

722
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with it at a very very large</font>

723
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,190
scale we need to change a paradigm we

724
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,860
really fundamentally change the paradigm

725
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:43,060
and this is the beginning my asked of i

726
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:47,140
80 f so we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

727
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:51,250
for almost 40 years now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have assumed</font>

728
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:53,560
trust right if you if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me if you</font>

729
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,020
if you can shake my hand in the proper

730
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:59,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">way in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nestle secret way we're good</font>

731
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:05,560
come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in well we have to start to</font>

732
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:08,530
change that I think you know DNA suckers

733
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,779
on the right direction why the adoption

734
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:12,280
isn't higher I have no idea I just

735
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">really don't understand that one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">scratched my head like all the time on</font>

737
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,720
this one's like well we know they have a

738
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:20,650
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good solution why aren't we using</font>

739
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:24,220
go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> please I'm sorry you read the</font>

740
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:26,140
slide exactly and that's exactly the

741
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,480
challenge we have we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get past</font>

742
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:30,609
that we collectively that's me on the

743
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,830
user community and you on the design

744
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:35,070
community we have to do a better job

745
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:37,020
because this is not sustainable

746
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:39,540
I do not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be responsible for some</font>

747
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sun target attack on it on a autonomous</font>

748
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,529
driving vehicle I don't want to be there

749
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:51,690
I don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the responsibility</font>

750
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:55,280
on my shoulders convenience so let's

751
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,280
talk about convenience since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're here</font>

752
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:02,340
who is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is in convenience the</font>

753
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,529
designer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the implementer or the or the</font>

754
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:09,750
other consumer consumer being in this

755
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:13,800
case I'm sorry no wrong answer all of us

756
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:15,330
should be in convincing bully that we're

757
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,740
the ones who have to deal with it right

758
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're the ones would have to implement</font>

759
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,459
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in oh by the way add more stuff to</font>

760
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:28,290
to circumvent the weaknesses back to my

761
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:30,360
42 different security services that is

762
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,250
not sustainable we have to inconvenience

763
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,180
everyone a little bit we're all in this

764
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,300
together all three all three

765
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:39,419
organizations all three groups so I

766
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:43,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">think one of the things is to consider</font>

767
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:45,660
in any new design reputation I am a

768
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,240
tremendous believer in crowdsourcing it

769
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,609
works it's hard with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> thumb on the</font>

770
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,129
scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> and crowdsourcing people may be</font>

771
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,690
wrong in a crowd right we see this all

772
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,600
the time in elections right people can

773
00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:00,360
be wrong in a crowd but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

774
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:05,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a now you have a much</font>

775
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:08,340
better indication of the explicit trust

776
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,740
not a hundred percent which now you're

777
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:16,620
now you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight to add to your</font>

778
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:19,620
decision one of the things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do</font>

779
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:23,220
as we all know is that we don't we don't

780
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,839
associate firmly with the exception of

781
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,180
sexy and ashes example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean Dean a</font>

782
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:32,130
second so I like it that's a great model

783
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:35,250
to use yes it's hard yes circuit I mean

784
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:40,320
such certificates<font color="#CCCCCC"> in PTI it hard and</font>

785
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's and clearly it's not a panacea one</font>

786
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,090
of the that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a semantic we were going</font>

787
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:46,350
to know we were in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PTI business and</font>

788
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,120
you know we all know if you've been to a

789
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,828
signing ceremony with your hood and

790
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

791
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:52,549
kind of cool it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult it's</font>

792
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:54,440
difficult to manage it's difficult to

793
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:56,329
management when individuals leave your

794
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,319
company who are part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signing</font>

795
00:39:56,329 --> 00:40:02,359
right this is hard this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard but</font>

796
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:05,779
we have to stand up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that</font>

797
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:09,410
challenge I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again DNS SEC is</font>

798
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:11,719
in a good example of a framework but as

799
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,609
we come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with new protocols especially</font>

800
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:17,229
for key important products not for

801
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:22,640
everything we have to consider

802
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:24,499
affirmatively associating this is the

803
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,538
one that troubles me the most on the

804
00:40:24,499 --> 00:40:30,288
implementer side i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

805
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:33,170
implementations of SNMP one that meets

806
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:35,229
the letter in a spirit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RFC one</font>

807
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:38,079
that meets the letter when is the spirit

808
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:40,749
guess which two<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack and</font>

809
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:45,200
guess which two i probably will get in

810
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:47,149
we have to reduce that ambiguity now I

811
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,640
say this from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different perspective I</font>

812
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:52,309
came from a nancy world I boson<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

813
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,618
answer committees and as we all know you

814
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:58,369
can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> your entire career used to</font>

815
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:59,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">anansie because the the the longevity in</font>

816
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:05,119
the long pole I mean estar the long tail

817
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:07,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Celia ratification implementation but</font>

818
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,680
at the end there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room</font>

819
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,349
for ambiguity there was some of course

820
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,089
because why humans are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still involved</font>

821
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:16,759
but we need to address this problem

822
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:18,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">because as a practitioner I see</font>

823
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:21,459
variations all over the place and

weaknesses some are not some Ark strong

826
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:27,380
storm is subtle but that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad</font>

827
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:30,049
guys can figure it out could they've got

00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,049
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and money on their side and oh by</font>

829
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:35,390
the way they have conferences like this

830
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:41,930
they share knowledge they sell in the

831
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:44,449
haulage to assume ill intent that's

832
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:46,249
what's happening this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> new news</font>

I'm sorry it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not news breaking this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

837
00:41:56,779 --> 00:42:00,710
be pretty good this is a change in

paradigm

839
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:08,900
as a practitioner I'm asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

consideration<font color="#E5E5E5"> automation is going to</font>

00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,640
had a rule for what a mighty for a

activity more than twice a week it was

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,599
subject to automation than me have to

846
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:28,849
automate it but consider it and again it

847
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,220
remarkable when folks at the time the

848
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:33,349
inconvenience to write either the

scripts or the tool to help them

850

necessarily which is Federation in a

00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:58,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing right let us do that it's so that</font>

859
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:03,339
we can do that from everything from a

860
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:06,410
pen occation authorization lookups are

861
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:09,259
cashing could be a control and vetted

862
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:10,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">cashing for example let's assume that</font>

00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,470
that Federation capabilities are<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:15,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">not there for everybody won't be but for</font>

865
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:18,740
large organizations it certainly can be

866
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:20,330
and virtualization of course we all know

867
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,189
this is nothing new but assume that's

868
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,680
committed to fall if I'm if I'm building

869
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:29,570
anything today<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's starting with with</font>

870
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:32,450
virtualization now there and the network

871
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:33,890
itself has to be part of the solution it

872
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,080
does so for all the network

873
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:39,080
practitioners we have to be part of the

874
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,880
solution and not and not a innocent

875
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,529
bystander it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like this smart</font>

876
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,080
highway and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be part of the</font>

877
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:50,599
solution so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't do this right</font>

878
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:53,540
when that intelligent vehicle is a

879
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:55,700
targeted attack and someone dies we will

880
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,560
see far more legislation which gives us

881
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,629
less flexibility to do the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

882
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">we believe are right I'm not saying this</font>

883
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:04,790
as a observer I've been very active on

884
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:06,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hill been brought in many times to</font>

talk to both<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress's Senate in the</font>

legislation and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact</font>

888
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:19,340
oh look mrs. this is real there are some

889
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:23,090
terrible legislations that are already

890
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:25,300
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place to to date with exception of</font>

891
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:28,130
one they have not been prescriptive

892
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,810
that's the next generation they're going

893
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell us how to do our work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bylaws and</font>

894
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:34,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">of course that's something we don't want</font>

895
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:37,880
but if we now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mint pause there for a</font>

896
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:39,650
quick second because in the US there's

897
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,360
an experienced executive order in 2012

898
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:45,790
the president said Val shelf 6 share

899
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,990
intelligence with the private sector

900
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:50,630
didn't happen four years later three

901
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:52,669
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later a law came out see is a in</font>

902
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:56,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. basically said the same thing</font>

903
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:57,740
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> who to share with was always the</font>

904
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,089
problem because if you're a vertical

905
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,490
like a financial industries and like

906
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:03,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine you've been doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for years but</font>

907
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,720
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not who d shared with right</font>

908
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:07,760
getting so now there's a statute<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

909
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:10,310
says now you have to share you have to

910
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,620
consume it and there's no vehicle to do

911
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:14,090
it so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the artifact of poor</font>

912
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,250
artifact of laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to be careful</font>

913
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:17,780
with and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we if we do our job right we</font>

914
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,480
can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> to circumvent some of this this</font>

915
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">is definitely a my soapbox sorry about</font>

916
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,080
that but it's been years years and years

917
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,080
on this thang

918
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:41,900
I will take questions public go ahead

919
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:44,359
Carrie Lynn uh in an earlier century

920
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:47,400
something like the launch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sputnik</font>

921
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:48,959
really changed you know the education

922
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,089
system in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

923
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:54,089
us are sort of the product of that at

924
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:56,279
least those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us with gray hair um it</font>

925
00:45:54,089 --> 00:46:00,538
seems to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know what you're</font>

926
00:45:56,279 --> 00:46:02,930
sort of implying is we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

927
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:05,789
things a lot differently we need to

928
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:09,379
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way we educate computer</font>

929
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:11,999
science students who exactly is going to

930
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:15,059
make that clarion call and who's going

931
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:18,089
to set you know the agenda that is a

932
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:19,680
very very good question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I to even though</font>

933
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:22,319
i don't have gray hair yet if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had a</font>

934
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:26,459
beard it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was a student of the</font>

935
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:28,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">60s and there we do need that clearing</font>

936
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:31,739
call I don't I don't know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

937
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:33,749
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in stem are my company is very</font>

938
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:36,269
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's as an</font>

939
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:38,578
example where an ietf cannot reach you

940
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:40,439
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know i don't i wish i had</font>

941
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,759
to answer that but that's the first step

942
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,150
in a 12-step program is this

943
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:48,299
acknowledging we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and I I</font>

944
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:50,249
intentionally try to scare people and I

945
00:46:48,299 --> 00:46:52,349
don't use that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually don't with</font>

946
00:46:50,249 --> 00:46:54,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity but what I'm starting to</font>

947
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:59,039
see now is starting to see things that

948
00:46:54,150 --> 00:47:02,009
people can die I get nervous and we

949
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,289
collectively are part of that so I

950
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:06,239
suggest maybe the outreach<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my a tip</font>

951
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:08,219
I don't again I'm an interloper I just

952
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,829
happened to drop in and hopefully share

953
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:14,309
some words with you but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do</font>

954
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:16,440
something stem is very is a very in

955
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:19,170
thing right now it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the right</font>

956
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,299
vehicle i will tell you coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

957
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:23,729
academia the teaching of computer

958
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:26,579
science is woefully on it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it's</font>

959
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:28,859
just ridiculous still is people are

960
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:31,709
focusing on pen testing and breaking

961
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:33,900
things not designing things to be

962
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:35,339
resilient from a security attack we have

963
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,529
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that as well but I hear you</font>

964
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:39,869
loud<font color="#E5E5E5"> and clear again the IETF and if I</font>

965
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:44,309
can help I'm more than happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

966
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:46,440
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sir hi I'm Daniel con Gilman</font>

967
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:48,760
from the ACLU the Americans

968
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,800
so thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming today and I totally</font>

969
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree with you that we have this there's</font>

970
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,950
a set of massive problems around secured

971
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:58,270
infrastructure and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> trust and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

972
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,180
a question for you specifically in your

973
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:05,230
role as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Juniper security officer about</font>

974
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:08,230
the recent screen LS vulnerabilities you

975
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:12,460
guys have used dual EC in your in the

976
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:16,750
screen OS devices and with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh with</font>

977
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:19,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the custom cue so that when the dual EC</font>

978
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:22,240
vulnerability was announced and make and

979
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,980
made quite clear I believe your response

980
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,890
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we use we use our own cue</font>

981
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:28,270
so my question for you was um well I

982
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:30,730
guess it's sort of a two-part thing but

983
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:32,350
why did you choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use dual EC RPG</font>

984
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:34,870
when it was slower than the other our

985
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:37,270
energies in the first place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to how</font>

986
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:40,029
did you generate your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> cue but what</font>

987
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:41,860
mechanism do you use was so so I'm going

988
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:45,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">to answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this the following way we have</font>

989
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:48,670
formerly responded in our and our FAQ

990
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:55,180
which we're still is distiller vehicle

991
00:48:48,670 --> 00:49:00,700
are a response a pinup response you can

992
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:04,270
debate rewinding the art the RNG

993
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:07,330
discussion at that time I wasn't with

994
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:09,100
juniper but I was implementing ECC and

995
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,380
we were debating looks ourselves how to

996
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,720
do it right nobody knew the proper way

997
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,700
then when this was originally done so

998
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,189
I'm gonna leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and and</font>

999
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,930
kindly ask that you review the FAQ I

1000
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:24,760
believe it may have been refreshed I'm

1001
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:27,370
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so sure but ok but but from from</font>

1002
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,350
your point about trust and that we need

1003
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:31,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of assume that devices are</font>

1004
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,380
malicious that are that we are

1005
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,870
interacting with over the network I'm

1006
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering I mean surely you understand</font>

1007
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:39,970
that there's a that juniper suffered a

1008
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:42,880
like trust and juniper devices must have

1009
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:44,259
gone down as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of seeing the the</font>

1010
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,760
series of vulnerabilities that were

1011
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,080
announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm wondering if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1012
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,520
any proposals for how we can restore

1013
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:52,150
trust in the Juniper Networks like have

1014
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:54,430
you guys considered for example opening

1015
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:58,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">your source control so that people can</font>

1016
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:59,750
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually happened or any other</font>

1017
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,970
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear and</font>

1018
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:04,490
I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am and I'm not I'm not</font>

1019
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:06,410
saying this to to to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shortcut</font>

1020
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:08,000
the answer but I do appreciate the

1021
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:10,460
question it's a valid question but I

1022
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,720
believe we've answered with exception of

1023
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:15,140
the source control access which we do

1024
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">for certain parties under NDA and and</font>

1025
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,819
licensing I think we've and I think

1026
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,860
we've answered that be remember this was

1027
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:24,530
also screen OS product which yes people

1028
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:27,500
are still using<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a completely</font>

1029
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:31,250
different part of a model<font color="#E5E5E5"> than we do for</font>

1030
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:36,860
just completely different ok any

1031
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:38,930
questions yes sir my name is Jim Galvin

1032
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:40,970
and I something just<font color="#E5E5E5"> occurred to me and</font>

1033
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:43,310
listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last question because</font>

1034
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:46,609
he asked you about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how did you</font>

1035
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:48,380
the presumption was that trust of

1036
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">Juniper on gown result of the incident</font>

1037
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,740
and so what are you doing to bring it

1038
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:53,330
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually I want to want to</font>

1039
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:56,330
challenge the assertion that that's what

1040
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:59,810
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think what would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1041
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:01,340
say I mean I get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot of what</font>

1042
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:03,320
you said and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've always</font>

1043
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:06,110
felt about security and security

1044
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,030
incidents is the fundamental problem is

1045
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:10,670
the fact that people really don't seem

1046
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:13,190
to care I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough people or not</font>

1047
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:15,410
the right people care so did your

1048
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,090
trusted<font color="#E5E5E5"> trusted juniper go down maybe</font>

1049
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:18,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know tiny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little blip</font>

1050
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:20,840
for a moment among people who are

1051
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:22,670
practitioners but in reality is a

1052
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,290
practical<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter who noticed and who</font>

1053
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:26,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">really cared and why would it matter and</font>

1054
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,560
wouldn't you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's part of the</font>

1055
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,569
problem that we're dealing with here and

1056
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the large it seems that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

1057
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:32,660
message that you're trying to convey

1058
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,700
here you know I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not so much a</font>

1059
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,710
mess amor complacency I think it's kind

1060
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're addressing it and I say no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1061
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:41,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the practitioners at we had</font>

1062
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:44,720
without a doubt<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest response was</font>

1063
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:46,549
you were quick to respond you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

1064
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,049
and transparent as much as you can be on

1065
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:51,320
this problem anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than you</font>

1066
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:53,240
corrected it right so if there was a

1067
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,250
blip i think was restored in fact to a

1068
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,229
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was there's been their</font>

1069
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,460
response and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're</font>

1070
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,720
being nice they were dishonest because

1071
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,940
it does happen it's not this is not

1072
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">unique to Jennifer we all know this this</font>

1073
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:09,610
particular but the complacency issue i

1074
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:13,080
think is less about lack of interest

1075
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:15,750
then that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of the world</font>

1076
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:19,049
how many how many updates do we get

1077
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:21,630
across our portfolio each week used to

1078
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:23,700
be a lot you know patch tuesday was ok

1079
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,840
I'm going on vacation Monday night right

1080
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,299
there's nowhere to be around and patch

1081
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,100
tuesday it's gotten better but we also

1082
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,140
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot more an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hour and are in our</font>

1083
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,730
inventory so we're always constantly

1084
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:36,930
patching it goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my management</font>

1085
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:39,660
playing discussion so we expect that now

1086
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:42,120
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm saying let's not expect that</font>

1087
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,609
let's change the entire paradigm to

1088
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:53,430
reduce the noise is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm suggesting</font>

1089
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:59,250
it doesn't make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy is gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1090
00:52:53,430 --> 00:53:00,750
huawei i'm looking at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> from like</font>

1091
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:03,720
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your expectation towards the</font>

1092
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">ietf question in terms of improving</font>

1093
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,129
security and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font>

1094
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:11,160
noticed i mean ITF we we can of like

1095
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:13,200
wake<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and then we try to do things but</font>

1096
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,930
our standards process<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font>

1097
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,960
shortest maybe not as bad as an see but

1098
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:20,790
we take some time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

1099
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,860
time there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source community</font>

1100
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:25,560
which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of moves a little faster and</font>

1101
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,150
I wonder like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> view like</font>

1102
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:29,520
what it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be your advice I mean is</font>

1103
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:31,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it like you feel like open source is</font>

1104
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,000
actually solving your problems and maybe

1105
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:35,040
standardization is actually not fast

1106
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,200
enough for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you need is there</font>

1107
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:41,880
something you would like to advise us<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1108
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:44,609
how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work better some ideas from</font>

1109
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:48,450
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> site you know that Tobias correct I</font>

1110
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:51,780
appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two quick</font>

1111
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:53,580
answers 1 is my expectation I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask not</font>

1112
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,660
expectation for my<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked of i hf and the</font>

1113
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,130
by the centralized if i have the same

1114
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:58,920
conversations with the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

1115
00:53:56,130 --> 00:54:02,270
communities to is think differently to

1116
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:07,290
to abuse apple right think different

1117
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:10,460
yeah when you design assuming harm as a

1118
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:13,350
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle can go a long way</font>

1119
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,610
we'll find out it's the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1120
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,990
earlier question with regard to what do

1121
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:19,350
we do with training the next generation

1122
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:21,240
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> age if they come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of school</font>

1123
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:22,940
thinking this way can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you imagine the</font>

1124
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,868
next to the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation of protocols</font>

1125
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,999
completely different

1126
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:29,009
right that's my ask of idea to think a

1127
00:54:26,999 --> 00:54:30,569
little differently right and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1128
00:54:29,009 --> 00:54:33,749
somewhat prescriptive of what I'm asking

1129
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:38,490
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a practitioner but at the end of</font>

1130
00:54:33,749 --> 00:54:40,399
the day we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have what we have you know</font>

1131
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:44,490
what we have is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have for now</font>

1132
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:48,150
what the if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about 30 years is</font>

1133
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:51,269
a long time think about a car in 1986 in

1134
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:56,220
the car in 2016 think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

1135
00:54:51,269 --> 00:54:59,069
in two thousand i'm in 1986 and 2016<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1136
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:00,720
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference is just scale frankly but</font>

1137
00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:02,819
car is a radically different they're

1138
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,049
smarter they're quicker they're safer we
