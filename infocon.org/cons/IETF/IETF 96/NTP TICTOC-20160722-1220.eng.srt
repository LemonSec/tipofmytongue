and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for today is to talk a</font>

46
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,510
little bit about the tick tock working

47
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:17,540
group status talk about the yang data

48
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:19,100
module model and the what we want to do

49
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,839
next with the scalable synchronization

50
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:27,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network work and then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to step</font>

51
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,490
back briefly and talk about the mid so

52
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,570
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I see ya cough is online</font>

53
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,720
the one thing that I had left off the

54
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:40,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">agenda was next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steps for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MPLS draft</font>

55
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:44,240
mpls<font color="#CCCCCC"> over 1588 draft so maybe we'll</font>

56
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:46,460
bring that up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end Jack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over here</font>

57
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,870
if you're actually online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and can hop</font>

58
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:56,300
into the speaker queue at some point

59
00:09:47,870 --> 00:10:01,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be useful so so I'm working</font>

60
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:04,189
group status um so we have a a 1588

61
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,690
version to mid and it has gone all the

62
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:10,570
way through working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group last call and</font>

63
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,570
it's with the iesg and there is a

64
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:29,939
okay so the myth has gone through the

65
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:31,829
iesg and it is there is a in the last

66
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,600
call process there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question raised</font>

67
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:39,390
about copyright questions about how much

68
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">material is from I Tripoli 1588 that's</font>

69
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:46,110
repeated in the mid this was a question

70
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had told you might be resolved by</font>

71
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:52,110
today but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has not been there is a</font>

72
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,170
triple the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf coordination group they</font>

73
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,279
are addressing the issue and I think

74
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,229
we're going to be scheduling a

75
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,610
conference call in the near future but

76
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,640
that one should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really close to done</font>

77
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:06,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only remaining issue beyond some</font>

78
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,670
editorial updates is to resolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

79
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,709
issue of how we proper do properly deal

80
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:14,610
with the copyright I think part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

81
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:16,950
issue is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I triplet 1588 is not i</font>

82
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,200
triple e a tattoo and so we we have

83
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,520
fairly refined processes for dealing

84
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">with i trow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prieta too but not</font>

85
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:29,819
necessarily 1588 so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing is</font>

86
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:32,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the yank data model there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are no updates</font>

87
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:40,200
to the ending data model the question

88
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:42,990
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also around how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we work it's</font>

89
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,920
also currently a little bit in a holding

90
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,080
state as we clarify how we work between

91
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,060
ITF and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> tripoli 1588 with the</font>

92
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:56,160
intention being that the yang model

93
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:58,709
would be developed and it would for 1588

94
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,980
version 2 and then it would transition

95
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:04,550
to 1588 for development of a yang module

96
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,709
for version 3 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> beyond and we also</font>

97
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:12,750
scoped the 1588 version to version of it

98
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:17,459
to be specifically to model<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the</font>

99
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:20,550
data sets in the version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 model in the</font>

100
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:22,709
version to specification of 1588 so I

101
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:29,099
don't know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> any of the authors of that</font>

102
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:31,420
are here at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't see you</font>

103
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,460
so

104
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,020
and we also have no update on that I

105
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,390
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the resolution of those two</font>

106
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,460
issues are a little bit beyond the scope

107
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,740
of this working group so we need to work

108
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,730
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E 1588</font>

109
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,990
leadership to make sure that we have the

110
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,540
processes in place that will enable us

111
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:53,970
to do that transition so there's nothing

112
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:56,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">more to report on that work this week so</font>

113
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,090
the next thing on the agenda was a

114
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:04,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussion of the scalable</font>

115
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:08,230
synchronization networks effort and this

116
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:12,780
was brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the tick-tock working</font>

117
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:16,360
group a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of I 80s ago then we</font>

118
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:22,810
established a mailing list separate IETF

119
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:26,680
mailing list to talk about to further

120
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:36,599
refine the problem statement are the

121
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:36,599
authors of those documents here I

122
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,100
thought one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to be here</font>

123
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:55,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I don't see any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the authors here</font>

124
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,710
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to a certain extent that</font>

125
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">answers part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my question about</font>

126
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tick tock working group</font>

127
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,810
wants to adopt this work or not I think

128
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">at this point we do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have consensus</font>

129
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:07,839
to adopt it it needs to be much more

130
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:11,430
fleshed out are there any is there any

131
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,750
discussion about developing this work

132
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,920
let me ask this question how many people

133
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:21,790
have read the original scalable

134
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:25,060
synchronization network drives one<font color="#E5E5E5"> yay</font>

135
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,260
Brian how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are aware of the</font>

136
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,390
fact that we have a separate mailing

137
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,750
list to discuss scalable synchronization

138
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,750
networks

139
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:41,520
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have subscribed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

140
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:52,170
mailing list now that I mention it

141
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:53,040
you'll subscribe to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well what I</font>

142
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,660
would really

143
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,040
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group consensus not to do</font>

144
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:01,350
this work at this time which I'm go

145
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,529
ahead Brian I will not say anything that

146
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:08,130
discriminates against short people Brian

147
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Haberman so the last thing I remember</font>

148
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:13,500
about the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that scalable</font>

149
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:16,589
synchronization network I I want to say

150
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,180
it was Benoit was kind of looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

151
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:20,459
from an operational point of view and

152
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,050
the question was really is this a

153
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:25,800
protocol issue is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really just a</font>

154
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:27,630
network management issue so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

155
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,449
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you talk to your ad to</font>

156
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:34,310
talk to the ops 80s and figure out if

157
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:37,019
they decided if that was true or not but

158
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,609
I tent I tend to agree based on what

159
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,670
i've read that that this is not a

160
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:54,089
protocol issue but say it's an opposite

161
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:57,120
entrant issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay that simplifies</font>

162
00:15:54,089 --> 00:16:00,389
that so the last thing on the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

163
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,860
this week this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> making me feel I hope</font>

164
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:03,899
none of you stayed specially for this

165
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:09,709
meeting I did warn somebody you could

166
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:12,380
leave early so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next question is the</font>

167
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:15,420
we've talked several times about the

168
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:18,870
merging of ntp and tik-tok into a single

169
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,430
working group we will be doing this we

170
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:25,170
have been strongly encouraged to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

171
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:27,449
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it only makes sense I have</font>

172
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:36,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a couple of just a sense of the</font>

173
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:38,689
room types of questions we is there on

174
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:41,910
any strong feeling about whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

175
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:43,699
leave the ntp working group or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

176
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,560
a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group that merges the two</font>

177
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:51,089
did other any<font color="#CCCCCC"> point do people out there</font>

178
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:58,119
say any confusing the community issues a

179
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:59,800
soundless around that it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

180
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,510
make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the time working group</font>

181
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,370
then all matters related to time

182
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,650
technologies would have a home and you

183
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:10,119
wouldn't have any sort of fights between

184
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,680
the various camps all right for all

185
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:17,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">practical purposes these have been the</font>

186
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:19,809
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a while now so a</font>

187
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:22,149
single time working group that delete

188
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:24,660
that addresses all things related to

189
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:28,890
time synchronization protocols all

190
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,890
network time synchronization protocols

191
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:36,240
hi I'm just relaying<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecclestone here</font>

192
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,010
calling it only ntp would be confusing

193
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's the sense i wanted to</font>

194
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:44,770
get I also from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ntp perspective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

195
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,389
wondered<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it would be confusing to</font>

196
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:51,000
move ntp to a non ntp working group but

197
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:56,230
if it was something as simple as time

198
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,990
then I think that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fine so I</font>

199
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:03,280
have struggled a bit to get a charter

200
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,870
put together on this is there one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

201
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,090
people that would volunteer to help me

202
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:14,939
merge the Charter text shorter concise

203
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:19,889
single milestones<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stuart would help me</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">India to excellence a deterrent Stuart</font>

205
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:33,429
it feels<font color="#CCCCCC"> really ridiculous in front of</font>

206
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:38,170
this huge room with yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's lest there</font>

207
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:41,320
be any misunderstanding I was scratching

208
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,090
my head not volunteering I'm here

209
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">because time is clearly very important</font>

210
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:49,120
in security depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on time but I I'm</font>

211
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,459
sort of here in educational mode

216
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,889
one to come to meeting to be educational

217
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:08,100
because it's the drugs at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the</font>

earlier just briefly but independent of

277
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:19,689
the update process I'm an independent of

the I Triple E 1588<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF issue do you</font>

279
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,500
see any additional technical work

280
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,970
required or is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> document roughly</font>

281
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:31,320
ready to progress yeah for the technical

00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:34,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">aspects I don't see anything that is the</font>

283
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,679
in conversely so I as it's quite a

284
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:42,130

287
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:58,030
it's probably share a publication<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

288
00:23:52,300 --> 00:24:00,190
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk offline about the results</font>

289
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,990
of the I Triple E 15 of the attribute by

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,280
some more stuff and so i'm waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level the leadership to figure</font>

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,540
out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next steps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the general</font>

296
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,400
consensus is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this and it</font>

297
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:22,960
shouldn't be this hard and i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure</font>

298
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:28,600
what the application is but thank you

301
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:40,200
network work right yes yes for the

302
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:45,820
scalable annotation we have a set up a

303
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:49,570
middle-aged discuss this topic as a

304
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">single we have a greater progress you're</font>

305
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:57,490
the lot of a couple of months but we do

306
00:24:53,950 --> 00:25:03,750
like to have more import from the

307
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:05,520
attendees in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITV key and we also are</font>

308
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,870
socializing with

309
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:13,290
more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there industria we don't</font>

310
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:18,750
see a quite a few inches from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 so we</font>

311
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:23,970
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be where we are our discussion for</font>

312
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:28,200
the nest here i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet you okay um I</font>

313
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:30,510
think the conversation we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had was we</font>

314
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,130
don't see that I think we need

315
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,720
potentially we could send another

316
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,760
message to the time related working

317
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,340
groups but brian has also suggested the

318
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:44,100
management area working area management

319
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:45,919
area ops area so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can talk about that</font>

320
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">offline but I don't think that there's</font>

321
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,340
enough consensus to move it forward in

322
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,200
this air in this working group so we

323
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,760
think it might be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different topic area</font>

324
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,120
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk about that further</font>
