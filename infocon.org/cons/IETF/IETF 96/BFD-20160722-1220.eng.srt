observation is they give us room sizes

13
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,530
based on attendance which means if they

14
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:37,640
bias any session towards a Friday I

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,239
actually the cameras on us so I'll to

43
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:51,190
stay here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through our</font>

working group status this is our typical

45
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:57,010
note well at this point do you see this

46
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,980
of times this week I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> also note that</font>

47
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,560
the working group chairs are making a

48
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,180
push to try to get more reviewers for

49
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,240
our various documents get people

50
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,310
involved earlier so if you have some

51
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,560
interest in becoming more involved in

52
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:15,240
the active editing process of ITF please

53
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,240
let us know and we'll help you do that

54
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,190
so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of status we actually hit a</font>

55
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,350
nice milestone the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple weeks the</font>

56
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,900
seamless BFD work did published

generating RFC's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 78-80 through seven</font>

extensions to things like ospf and pals

60
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:39,760

now we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> prodded the working group</font>

multiple times regarding that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> efd</font>

mpls bid the work in there actually is

65
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:53,280
correct but there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no not a strong set</font>

66
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:56,460
of interest to drive the work forward

67
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,920
we've spoken<font color="#CCCCCC"> to over all goes our ad</font>

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> d chartering this work and if the</font>

document ever becomes interesting again

70
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,800
we can obviously move it forward but as

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,450
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our next charter update we will</font>

72
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,120
likely end up removing this from the

it's certainly ready for working group

76

last call and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just mostly need to</font>

lingering<font color="#E5E5E5"> point for our work ethic ation</font>

93
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,279
is that the curtain group prior to their

94
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,310
closure had provided a<font color="#CCCCCC"> serious</font>

95
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,490
recommendations for various protocols to

96

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> close off security issues</font>

97
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,770
within those protocols their

98
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:17,349
recommendations to BFD resulted in two

99
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:20,860
documents the first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a generic</font>

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,760

of keys mid-session this is something

104
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:33,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the FD cannot currently do and</font>

honestly given how fast BF he is done<font color="#CCCCCC"> ki</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">rollover is actually a very difficult</font>

107
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:41,800
thing to do that said we have been given

108
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">the impression from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple</font>

the moment the secondary component that

115
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:02,529
was recommended from them was a profile

118
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:12,100
are seem to be well reviewed pretty

119
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,220
solid but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment just sort of low</font>

is that we may actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

124
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,839
at a later point in time and it should

125
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:32,170
actually seem to have gotten ITF review

126
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,600
so our inclination is to look for

127
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,640
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shepherds work our way through</font>

128

the working group last call process and

129
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,839
publish these documents as experimental

130
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:47,130
rather than suppose standards have any

commentary on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current status</font>

132
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:56,560
okay next life so future work our

134
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,829
actually having at it will need to close

135
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:04,720
that off in terms of clearing stuff out

136
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,830
we also have no some other know things

158

having<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FDA's a review working group</font>

Rashad shall be presenting the progress

196
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:33,070
which has been going on on the BFD young

197
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:36,460
model the authors of the draft are on

198
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:38,380
that first page and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe only Greg</font>

199
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:43,060
is the other person<font color="#CCCCCC"> here or maybe zero</font>

200
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:45,010
I'm not sure anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide so when</font>

201
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,680
we last met in Yokohama there were a few

202
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:50,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">issues which were described about eight</font>

203
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,140
months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues which we which we</font>

204
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussed then had been address or</font>

205
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:59,140
mostly addressed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest revision</font>

206
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,760
of the draft one of the things we kind

207
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,550
of went around in circles<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a while</font>

208
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,680
was because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different</font>

209
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,540
configuration models in the industry

210
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,760
where sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD is configured</font>

211
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,560
centrally sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> dfds configured in</font>

212
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,010
the routing protocols

213
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,640
we after lots of back and forth between

214
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:20,740
us and you know the routing guys we went

215
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,350
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> having all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD configuration</font>

216
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,020
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> bfg as opposed on to under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

217
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,720
routing protocols there were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

218
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,240
reasons for that which were described in

219
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Yokohama and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides from</font>

220
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,720
there spoke about that the second change

221
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,939
was we had one single big model which

222
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,850
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address all the things BFD runs</font>

223
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,400
on and right now it's been split into

224
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,890
multiple models for example we have a

225
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,199
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> for IP single half or multi hub</font>

226
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:53,710
for mpls te for<font color="#E5E5E5"> log and that kind of</font>

227
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:56,130
stuff and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as we have gift as we</font>

228
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,210
have the young model for more

229
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,670
technologies on which we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> D runs</font>

230
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:05,310
then we'd be having those parallel

231
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:08,109
models and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing we had was</font>

232
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:10,389
for BFD over mpls t you know you

233
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:12,520
typically configure BF gilbert eternal

234
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">ekiti on all can have multiple LSPs</font>

235
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:19,599
there was no way for us to represent

236
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:22,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">that purely in VFD except by we by</font>

237
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,030
importing lots of things which were

238
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:28,359
defining the in the t model so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

239
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,690
decided to augment the<font color="#CCCCCC"> T model we have</font>

240
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,909
the config / t tunnel but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD</font>

241
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,700
session is<font color="#CCCCCC"> / LSP so for example you</font>

242
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:39,070
could have an active LSP and a back up

243
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,810
LSP on a te tunnel and you would have

244
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:45,070
config on the tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you would have</font>

245
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:47,530
operational state on each LSP the other

246
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,750
change we did was regarding the

247
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,250
authentication we had our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

248
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,770
authentication scheme and now we're

249
00:17:51,250 --> 00:18:00,010
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> keychain which is in the</font>

250
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:03,000
routing workgroup draft and so one of

251
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:06,160
the other issues we had in terms of

252
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,230
making progress is some of the modules

253
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,179
we depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there's been lots of change</font>

254
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,790
I mean lots of churn if you know you've

255
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,650
been attending you know whether it's net

256
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,000
mod or rotting<font color="#E5E5E5"> workgroup and all that</font>

257
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,520
you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to be routing</font>

258
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,100
instance we decided in dollars to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

259
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">rocked to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grf centric and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

other node 3 4 months ago the routing

261
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,470
instance was gone it's been

262
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,490
replaced by<font color="#CCCCCC"> network instance which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

263

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:36,010
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things was that the yang</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doll</font>

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,120
certain errors like xpath errors and one

270
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,030
of the things which was done in the

271
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,918
hackathon and prior to that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> karl has</font>

272
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:57,220
change his tool and<font color="#CCCCCC"> brought you to use</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">county compiler which detects xpath</font>

275
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:04,030
common things when you do one statements

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,100
or most statements that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know p young</font>

does not attack you know you easily

278
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,439
forget about dot or have an extra one so

279
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:16,660
we had couple things like that which we

280
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:21,610
had to fix next slide please so what is

281
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:24,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently not covered so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BFD / v CC v is</font>

not covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that's a neck thing</font>

283
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:31,330
we have to look into the LTV jian-yang

284
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:34,660
model is now is now or will soon be a

285
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,610
war group document there had been a fair

286
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,830
amount of churn I think the yang<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctors</font>

287
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:42,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">had bunch of comments so now that that</font>

288
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:45,280
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of firming up I think we can look</font>

289
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:47,710
but having bfg<font color="#E5E5E5"> Forbes pseudo wires the</font>

290
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,790
second thing was<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior / mpls-tp when</font>

291
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:54,130
the design team was<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> initially</font>

292
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,620
said that we would not cover mpls-tp and

293
00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:01,299
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seemed to be low priority</font>

294
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:03,340
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the t model but maybe Greg you can I</font>

295
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are working on a model for</font>

296
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:14,189
mpls-tp now yeah well not actively

297
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:18,390
working yet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an idea yes okay</font>

298
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,640
so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to talk about whether we</font>

299
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,380
discussion on the list or you know

300
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,160
whether we address that immediately or

301
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:30,040
whether we wait for the TP draft to be

302
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:33,240
more advanced before we tackle the FDA

303
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">for mpls-tp okay</font>

304
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:40,139
there's no our pcs right now in the

305
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:42,509
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the question to the room is my</font>

306
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:44,488
take is I mean so the usual stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

307
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,519
talk about is clearing of counters I

308
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:49,979
mean statistics and stuff like that but

309
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've heard others say that you know we</font>

310
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:53,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">should not be doing that because then</font>

311
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,070
you screw up your controller and the

312
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,218
controller is doing the Delta for you so

313
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:03,418
that's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open item yeah I think it's</font>

314
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:09,749
not just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BFD decision it's across the</font>

315
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:13,709
routing routing area<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh what's</font>

316
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:17,279
the what's the guidelines for this the

317
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:26,039
only other probably use our PC could be

318
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:31,200
if the echo what do you mean when you

319
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:33,479
want to send BFD echo on demand<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tiger</font>

320
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,259
leave the echo it's simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> because leave</font>

321
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:39,179
the echo effectively it's a thing

322
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:43,320
self-addressed thing so you want just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

323
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,639
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for certain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> duration well I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

324
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,259
that's something which might be

325
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:48,299
implementation-specific some

326
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:51,570
implementations do it all the time some

327
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,889
may do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on demand so we can go on the</font>

328
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,539
list on that if it's something which is

329
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:57,059
common I've got no issue with it being

330
00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:01,320
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> base rather I agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> query in the</font>

331
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:03,299
list and see there and one thing our pcs

332
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,979
might actually use for is depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

333
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:07,549
exactly how the line work actually

334
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:09,749
settles out this may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a way to expose</font>

335
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:16,019
procedures for allow me to make yourself

336
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:17,369
in their<font color="#CCCCCC"> mouths the only thing we were</font>

337
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:19,559
ignoring at the beginning of the design

338
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,208
team is seamless<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD because we said you</font>

339
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:23,339
know we're only talking RFC's well

340
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:27,659
seamless BFD isn't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's a</font>

341
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:29,549
bunch of our seas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff said my you</font>

342
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:31,200
know immediate take on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we</font>

343
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:36,239
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> any change in the model</font>

344
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,279
because there is no change to the data

345
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:40,409
model itself but that's something else

346
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,210
which we can take on the list and is

347
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:48,399
could be for further study

348
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:50,230
next slide please open<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues so after</font>

349
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:52,600
the routing instance you know compiled

350
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,909
failures<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took to augmenting network</font>

351
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,529
instance but this week I've had some

352
00:22:54,909 --> 00:23:03,640
discussions with the net mud guys and

353
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:05,649
the what the routing config model and I

354
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,279
think what the net mod my team is

355
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:10,959
pushing is that so one discussions we

356
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,990
had at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning was you know some</font>

357
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,659
implementations of some implementations

358
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,399
of VFD rgr fo where you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

359
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:20,529
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's routers and about DRS</font>

360
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:22,379
you configure be obtained<font color="#CCCCCC"> brf others</font>

361
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:26,260
might be simpler nodes which are maybe

362
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,299
transport nodes and there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> vrs so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

363
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,250
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> question has arise for other</font>

364
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:32,679
protocols and what those<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network guys</font>

365
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,539
are pushing for right now is you define

366
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">VFD you don't talk mountain your routing</font>

367
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:38,950
instance or networking instance but you

368
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,870
have it schema mounted based on your

369
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:49,600
implementation whether it's at the top

370
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:51,340
level or in the in the vrf that the last

371
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,779
week<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the network guys but I</font>

372
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:58,149
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is something which is going</font>

373
00:23:52,779 --> 00:24:00,279
to be up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for further discussion we've</font>

374
00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:01,959
had ongoing discussions there was

375
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:04,750
discussions yesterday in the line work

376
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">group as there's the line connectionist</font>

377
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:10,960
model which was presented again

378
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:15,158
yesterday I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some maybe</font>

379
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:19,270
mismatch in the views as to how the OEM

380
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:23,380
protocols use lime I think the line view

381
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:26,740
is that protocols like<font color="#CCCCCC"> dfv should be</font>

382
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,360
augmenting the line model I think those

383
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,279
OEM protocols might have the reverse

384
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,580
view we had some discussions yesterday

385
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:35,169
Greg okay Michael I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you</font>

386
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,539
guys had further discussions up but

387
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:39,429
Michael is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be present so we can</font>

388
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:41,890
have that discussion when Michael

389
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:43,240
presents alarm connectionless model and

390
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,809
I think it's something we'll have to

391
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:50,520
discuss further oh come the list

392
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:54,220
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> since you brother the</font>

393
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,860
interrelationship mpls-tp OM one om<font color="#CCCCCC"> BFD</font>

394
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:01,840
because the foundation force is

395
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:05,020
crdi are the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists through mpls-tp</font>

396

<font color="#CCCCCC">onto connection-oriented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yag well I'm</font>

397
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:12,540
model and there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of issues</font>

398
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,220
which the account decompiler is

399
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,649
complaining about which I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

400
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,450
good grasp on what's the error and I've

401
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,700
contacted them to see what should be

402
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,730
done so if you go to Benoit's page right

403
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:29,290
now you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that p yang is happy but</font>

404
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:33,880
count decompiler is not and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

405
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:35,799
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it any other questions thank you</font>

406
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and the issues that we're running</font>

407
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:40,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> standard that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">odd models the scheme amount that sort</font>

409
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,059
of thing is issues that every single ITF

410
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,139
group is facing at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font>

411
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:49,090
not anything that's blocking our

412
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,830
specific work this is us just dealing

413
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:56,860
with what the current state of the

414
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:59,830
matter is if there are no further

415
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,799
comments will move on to optimizing BFD

416
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:05,280
authentication which i'll be presenting

417
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">44 mesh</font>

418
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:25,710
good hmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the the purpose of the</font>

419
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,299
BFD optimizing authentication feature is

420
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:30,419
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take care of at least one of</font>

421
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:31,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">the obstacles for PFD authentication</font>

422
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,360
being deployed and that's namely if

423
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,380
you're using any sort of meticulous

424
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,049
authentication the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C fuel is</font>

425
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,940
burned by the authentication operation

426
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:43,830
tends to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more than what</font>

427
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,510
you can do in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your line cards</font>

428
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,850
and since we're operating a

429
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,889
resource-constrained environment looking

430
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,260
for more clever ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make use of the</font>

431
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:53,908

432
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,600
for authentication is something that's

00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:59,820
under evaluation compassion company had

434
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,830
done a nice draft where the fundamental

435
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,918
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that when we reached the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">signing and we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't bother</font>

438
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:12,899
design a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things the dockyard</font>

439
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,490
right now really<font color="#E5E5E5"> has had no substantive</font>

changes since the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time was</font>

441
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:19,380
presented the security implications

442
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:21,149
about leaving it in this form where

443
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,539
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always working through</font>

444
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:26,428
assigned packets was the main

445
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:30,149
consideration we had to work through the

446
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:31,950
request<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the security directors was</font>

447
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:34,260
that we should actually go talk to the

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:39,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">sa AG people to see if they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

449
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:41,908
considerations looks like so we had

450
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,399
breakfast with some of them on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday</font>

451

<font color="#E5E5E5">morning and the commentary that we had</font>

458
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,519
not necessarily be a state change and

459
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,260
it's mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:14,639

464
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:17,639
part they seem to be generally okay with

465
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:19,979
the idea especially for the problem

possibly so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the piece</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

procedure that does need to be spelled

483
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,770
out is that in the window where you're

484
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,600
expecting an FN decade attacker they

485
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,250
show up there needs to be potentially an

486
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,040
extended window longer than the

487
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,660

00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,139
actually supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be up or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down yes</font>

489
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly that's where I'm driving so that</font>

490
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:32,200
specification of how failure to

491
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:35,170
authenticate impact the state machine

00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:40,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">its needs to be spelled out I would</font>

493
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:42,280
agree and<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we see here they were</font>

494
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,790
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with this idea of leaving</font>

495
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,860
things know partially unauthenticated

496
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:50,560
Ellen did add an additional suggestion

497
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,000
that we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something other than</font>

498
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,899
monotonically increasing sequence

499
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
numbers this allows us to avoid some of

500
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,150
the predictive attacks that we have so

501
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,500
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> having some sort of key</font>

502
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:04,870
algorithm would be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the sequence</font>

503
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,840
number is predictable by each side that

504
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,659
has the key without<font color="#CCCCCC"> allowing the item in</font>

505
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,480
the middle just<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply spoof it out so</font>

506
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:15,550
in cases where a signing operation is

507
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,380
that not actually being<font color="#E5E5E5"> done you know</font>

508
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,540
there's some level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protection still</font>

509
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:23,020
being given by having an idea of what

510
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:25,300
the actual sequence number would need to

511
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,730
be so the sequence number to some extent

512
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,190
becomes really a no secret sequence over

513
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:33,370
and this helps mitigate some of the

514
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,110
attack space<font color="#CCCCCC"> helen was going to actually</font>

515
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,000
suggest us a couple algorithms that

516
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,689
should be able to be done in a fairly

517
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,690
constant time

518
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:46,960
so in terms of the next steps the draft

519
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:50,260
has been stable for a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this is</font>

520
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,710
a useful feature this does help us with

521
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:57,760
our scenarios where we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play</font>

522
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:59,650
stronger no cryptographic mechanisms one

523
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,870
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually approach this is adopted</font>

524
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:04,060
then along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the other authentication</font>

525
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,659
work tried to do it as a batch<font color="#E5E5E5"> no this</font>

526
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,649
is again from the working group status

527
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,300
not something that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> traditionally</font>

528
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,940
gotten a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest in the work</font>

529
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:15,100
working group and interest among

530
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,810
operators is you know modestly low but

531
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,600
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security problem security</font>

532
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:21,730
stuff is the interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it always</font>

533
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,469
happens long after the fact if you don't

534
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,950
have the feature and a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

535
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:30,010
becomes known having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution in RFC</font>

536
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:32,560
somewhere is actually a useful thing so

537
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:34,720
the authors are looking to have the

538
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,700
working group adopt the document and

539
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:42,610
potentially last call it relatively soon

540
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:45,700
thereafter<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I do agree that this is</font>

541
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:49,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">an interesting work and the document is</font>

542
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:51,340
reasonable for adoption but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the</font>

543
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:57,030
last call definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to sort out</font>

544
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:57,030
this impact on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state machine I</font>

545
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:06,760
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the last light here so</font>

546
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:09,669
any further comment on this proposal we

547
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:13,360
will be taking adoption to the email

548
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:14,770
list just as a attempt to get daggett

549
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,110
know some generally working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

550
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:19,600
just show of hands no don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a home</font>

551
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,520
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know who here thinks this</font>

552
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:27,179
is actually work that the working group

553
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:29,830
should take up yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we show a couple</font>

554
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:31,630
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other question who here</font>

555
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:36,730
thinks this is work that the working

556
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:38,360
group should simply not take up no show

557
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:42,920
of hands thank you

558
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:44,389
and the building the stability why were

559
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,380
you presenting that all right thank

560
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:50,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">ducks yeah I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it activate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never do</font>

561
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:52,400
ok so again i'm playing virtue<font color="#CCCCCC"> mahesh no</font>

562
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:58,550
just as a brief update on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DFT</font>

563
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:02,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">stability show of the authors so again</font>

564
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:04,550
this was a attempt to make use of<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD to</font>

565
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,680
measure the stability of a link this is

566
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,629
not being used to actually take a

567
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,420
session down<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is simply where you</font>

568
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,940
actually want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> an existing stream</font>

569
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,240
session that's going across the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

570
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:19,400
try to detect periodic disruptions and

571
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,500
you know the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> purpose is to see or</font>

572
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">what if there's some form of loss this</font>

573
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,160
is obviously not<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant to replace</font>

574
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,110
mechanisms such as CFM the suspect be a

575
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:32,510
supplementary mechanism in terms of the

576
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,860
mechanism you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was again take</font>

577
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,660
advantage of the fact that we have

578
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,060
sequence numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> going across the</font>

579
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,130
authentication and watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> for drops in</font>

580
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:42,500
the sequence number packets just to see

581
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,730
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are there and that way if you</font>

582
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,500
happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a loss of a certain number</font>

583
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,640
of packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> no this gives you some level</font>

584
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">0 statistics the general idea is that we</font>

585
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,630
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use sequence numbers we could</font>

586
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,490
use cryptographic mechanisms but

587
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,800
honestly you know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font>

588
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,710
slow things down so part of the proposal

589
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:04,389
does include it in the bottom point here

590
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:07,100
a no auth tlv this is simply there to

591
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:12,350
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> use of the existing cryptographic</font>

592
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:14,139
general header looks like so they've

593
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:17,080
mostly just done some text publishing

594
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:19,819
they have done some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleanup in terms of</font>

595
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:23,120
reusing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> no off and try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ensured among</font>

596
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:26,990
the optimizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication field and</font>

597
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,759
the packet delays nope then put as a

598
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:30,979
implementation details specifically how

599
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,450
it's actually done beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is out</font>

600
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:38,060
the scope of the document draft is

601
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:40,879
stable and they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for working</font>

602
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,230
group adoption<font color="#E5E5E5"> now give this well this</font>

603
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually fits in the authentication</font>

604
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,610
bucket of work since it actually touches

605
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:48,770
that feature this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a standalone</font>

606
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:51,260
featured for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know trying to actually</font>

607
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:52,280
detect pack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss across the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FD</font>

608
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,349
session

609
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,030
so we'll take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for adoption</font>

610
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:59,339
to the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again you know</font>

611
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,900
could we see show of hands in the room

612
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:06,720
who thinks this is actually worth

613
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:08,910
adopting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay show a few people and some</font>

614
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:15,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">really question who here thinks that we</font>

615
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:20,490
should not take up this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> microphone</font>

616
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:25,260
please first<font color="#CCCCCC"> question was who thinks we</font>

617
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:30,689
should take up this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one more</font>

618
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:35,550
hand okay it was a brief presentation I

619
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:52,050
think we're ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Greg what are you</font>

620
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:58,160
presenting first um I'm Selig<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay an</font>

621
00:35:52,050 --> 00:36:01,400
excellent so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 71 30 addressed a</font>

622
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:07,140
important operational issue of

623
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:11,250
monitoring positioned links of a lag

624
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:17,390
link aggregation group yes there there

625
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:17,390
is a way to do it in CFM but

626
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,210
implementations that I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their</font>

627
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:34,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">non-standard so with interaction well</font>

628
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:38,849
with cooperation from I Tripoli ITF

629
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:41,190
managed to resolve that how to run on

630
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:43,800
the sub second intervals on the

631
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:46,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">individual concision thinks so</font>

632
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,500
effectively creating a set of identical

633
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">sessions with different discriminators</font>

634
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:58,010
and usually you run it with the same

635
00:36:51,630 --> 00:37:01,170
time interval but we realized that the

636
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,790
solution proposed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 72 month 30 does</font>

637
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:06,400
not address

638
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:09,540
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are MC leg scenario so when you</font>

639
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,730
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the head end and you have</font>

640
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:16,810
redundancy group so you want your leg

641
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:22,690
from their head<font color="#CCCCCC"> end to work seamlessly</font>

642
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:26,250
as with a normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> leg so basically to see</font>

643
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:31,720
the redundancy group as a single note ah

644
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:34,500
next slide please so in this there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

645
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:38,169
two proposals that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small and</font>

646
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:41,260
one of them addresses when we do our IP

647
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:49,570
encapsulation so in IP encapsulations

648
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:55,000
we're proposing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use either multicast</font>

649
00:37:49,570 --> 00:38:00,970
address or use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> local broadcast our</font>

650
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:04,359
next what<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are in IP MPLS</font>

651
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:07,868
Network then encapsulation of VFD

652
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:12,880
control packet could be either with ap

653
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:18,369
header or with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an or ACH encapsulation</font>

654
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:22,119
so if its IP header then associate the

655
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:27,000
channel will be used to indicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

656
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:30,609
ipv4 ipv6 and IP address will be

657
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:37,000
destination so to prevent the routing

658
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:40,710
out so it's 1 27 / 8<font color="#E5E5E5"> address-family with</font>

659
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:46,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">ACH encapsulation we identified as BFD</font>

660
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:53,020
that's why so that shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how it</font>

661
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:59,460
looks with UDP IP encapsulation and if

662
00:38:53,020 --> 00:39:03,430
it's a CH encapsulation the reverse path

663
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:07,270
could be either directed will be should

664
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:09,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">be directed / m select links because for</font>

665
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:14,800
internet services you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monitor it</font>

666
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:15,880
in bed and the same encapsulation could

667
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,960
be used there

668
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,970
as well that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Prashad</font>

669
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,430
question so when you see in the reverse

670
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,049
direction you mean from your PE to your

671
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:30,129
multi-homeruns you from area from

672
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:32,170
redundancy group to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the head end okay is</font>

673
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,660
there me ask you you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

674
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:38,049
it's a single hot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor</font>

675
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:40,930
the service are in band in both

676
00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:43,690
directions but does the choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

677
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:46,930
source and I mean you can can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose</font>

678
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:50,559
the local address on B and C or are you

679
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:51,970
saying you have to use I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

680
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,529
understood your last part where you said

681
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:56,259
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the same individual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay no</font>

682
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:59,230
the thing is that again it's just a hint

683
00:39:56,259 --> 00:40:01,750
to implementation that when you can

684
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:05,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure on redundancy group you need to</font>

685
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:08,950
associate it with its specific leg group

686
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:11,650
so that you will use this leg group okay

687
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:14,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">but the packets from B to a and c QA</font>

688
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,660
would be using what source address a

689
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:20,259
local source address if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're using if</font>

690
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:22,868
yes if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you if you are using IP</font>

691
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:28,630
and cups of I PDP encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

692
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:30,069
use your local source address<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

693
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,200
it's my impression that you're looking

694
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:35,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this work to actually adapted by pft</font>

695
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,649
um well we have the discussion around

696
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:41,950
there were no Cyrus and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were pointed</font>

697
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:44,710
out that it fits yeah even though it's

698
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:47,740
kind of somewhere in<font color="#CCCCCC"> between but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it fits</font>

699
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:50,589
better in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a VFD working group so here we</font>

700
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:53,410
are okay and this question goes out to

701
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:58,029
know one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our mpls chairs in the room</font>

702
00:40:53,410 --> 00:41:00,250
though would you be okay for this work

703
00:40:58,029 --> 00:41:03,250
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted within</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DFT but since it</font>

704
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:05,859
has a component that obviously is a mpls

705
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:08,069
one to have mpls act as a reviewer for

706
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:08,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">CH</font>

707
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:25,209

708
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:30,190
mic otherwise a chair shout at me

709
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:33,550
without my kids so yes I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

710
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:41,980
comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> it look my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted here I</font>

711
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:46,540
want us to be copied on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working</font>

712
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:49,930
group adoption<font color="#E5E5E5"> male and also when you go</font>

713
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:55,660
to work group last call<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's very</font>

714
00:41:49,930 --> 00:42:00,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasonable John messenger and is this</font>

715
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:04,029
compatible with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> drn I modifications</font>

716
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:07,529
to link aggregation which have been

717
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:10,150
standardized 80 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> on intense sensitive</font>

718
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:12,520
it's not the time sensitive network long

719
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:15,610
no content sensitive basically when you

720
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:19,930
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> pain on a particular constituent</font>

721
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:24,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">if low so that's a technical aspect yeah</font>

722
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:27,370
but in the link aggregation standard has

723
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,030
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated recently if you incorporate</font>

724
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:32,560
these this multi chassis while it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

725
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:34,930
called multi shot it's called dual

726
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,900
redundant it's called distributed

727
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:40,960
resilient network interface not your

728
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:44,500
redundant anything and and this

729
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:48,100
effectively standardizes a the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual home</font>

730
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:53,220
case and it also standardizes two nodes

731
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:57,430
on each side anymore that's interesting

732
00:42:53,220 --> 00:43:00,689
well frankly I haven't looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

733
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:06,879
latest version and how they supply cable

734
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:09,100
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD perspective this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

735
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">implementation detail and for my</font>

736
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:18,220
implementation experience I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that we</font>

737
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:22,410
are injecting a package<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a roar j6e so</font>

738
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,410
we're bypassing there

739
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:32,710
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would suggest that because of the</font>

740
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:37,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">work having been done in eight oh two</font>

741
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:39,700
dot one to handle this multihomed case

742
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:41,860
those considerations will have been

743
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,439
analyzed and may have been changed

744
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:47,860
fundamentally in the link aggregation

745
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,420
and so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary to</font>

746
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,210
coordinate this with<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight oh two dot</font>

747
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:55,030
one and not to work independently here

748
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:57,910
so i would request that you and send an

749
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:00,760
email to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Triple E ITF coordination</font>

750
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:04,569
group and to bring their attention to

751
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,760
this draft and request that the data to

752
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:09,910
one takes a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

753
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,920
thanks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> John I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't suppose we can</font>

754
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:16,270
convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to sign up as a reviewer to</font>

755
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal I could review it not be</font>

756
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:20,950
real good at finding the spelling errors

757
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:23,740
whether I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any constructive</font>

758
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,720
comment on the details of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> drn I</font>

759
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,910
aspects I'm not entirely convinced but I

760
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,009
can certainly point the right people at

761
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:33,520
it though there will be great that's

762
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:36,790
great or where eyeballs are good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um</font>

763
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,170
so since we're looking for a potential

764
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:40,330
adoption this working group again we'll

765
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,710
take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the mailing list but could we</font>

766
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:48,190
have a show of hands of people who think

767
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is work that is worth adopting yeah</font>

768
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:52,630
you have a few and are there any<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

769
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,310
buddy is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody in the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

770
00:44:52,630 --> 00:45:03,810
thinks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is work we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should not</font>

771
00:44:54,310 --> 00:45:07,840
take up no<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cheyenne's thank you okay</font>

772
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:15,130
moving along to metro station yes John

773
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:19,930
so third this week and<font color="#CCCCCC"> last at last the</font>

774
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:27,220
work on the application of VFD to EVP

775
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:30,250
and networks are then it will start<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

776
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:35,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">time ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then expired and recently</font>

777
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:38,220
offers God interest to review the

778
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,220
proposed solution and

779
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,920
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document we started from fresh</font>

780
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:47,470
so it's not continuation of expired

781
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,660
document but it does compare the

782
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:52,959
proposed solution to the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

783
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:56,230
was proposed originally so thus are we

784
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:00,250
refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the new solution as alternative</font>

785
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:03,370
solution but we think that alternative

786
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:07,480
solution has some advantages next slide

787
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:13,390
please so in VPN are you have a

788
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:16,650
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> architectural elements</font>

789
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:18,430
construct so you need to monitor a

790
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-point to pour into</font>

791
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:25,029
point-to-multipoint and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably even</font>

792
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:30,640
multi point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-point LSPs so thus</font>

793
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:33,790
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> combination of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BFD and the</font>

794
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,490
protocols to be used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example in the</font>

795
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:40,120
multiple into point it's a point to

796
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:42,100
point B of d & n point-to-multipoint it

797
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:46,779
obviously the BFD for a multi-point

798
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:49,839
network but in addition to that the

799
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,800
question is so how you identify the

800
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:56,320
scope of your BF d session and

801
00:46:52,800 --> 00:47:00,700
originally the proposal<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that to use</font>

802
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:05,970
the same encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course with a</font>

803
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:10,120
gal label as being used by the

804
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:12,189
corresponding traffic type that creates

805
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:16,350
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of complexity and probably</font>

806
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:19,510
unnecessary arm overhead so thus we

807
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:22,560
propose to use another alternative it

808
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:29,920
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next slide place so which</font>

809
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:34,390
uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACH encapsulation and provides the</font>

810
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,970
context in a POV when she follows<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

811
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:40,080
view control packet and that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

812
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,080
either for

813
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:47,320
unicast traffic so with the am I except

814
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:51,910
to me or if we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> two more slides</font>

815
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:55,380
further or inclusive multicast govt for

816
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:58,330
the bomb traffic so that that's

817
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:01,210
effectively the proposal yes it's a 0-0

818
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:05,610
version a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need to</font>

819
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:08,260
do and one of the big items that we are

820
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:13,390
planning to work next is the

821
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:16,390
bootstrapping of VFD sessions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font>

822
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:20,440
do have jabber comments from episod when

823
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:22,569
it first ask for some commentary on both

824
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,570
alternatives which you proceed to go

825
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:27,460
into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his second bit of</font>

826
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,930
commentary was that he personally thinks

827
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,840
that they're nerds for the first form of

828
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:36,640
encapsulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i used the l to header</font>

829
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:39,000
inside the gal gash<font color="#E5E5E5"> payload anything for</font>

830
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,000
the percent

831
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,940
one more request he was looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

832
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:03,709
comparing the consistency of BF de VPN

833
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:10,369
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> BFD for VX land yes that's that's if</font>

834
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:16,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">we go further</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide yes so in Dave</font>

835
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:21,529
DV excellent proposal it was proposed to

836
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:29,029
use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> VN I 0 as identify of the target</font>

837
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:33,819
and we are discussed instead of offers

838
00:49:29,029 --> 00:49:37,059
of two documents and just before their

839
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:41,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">berlin meeting we entertain the idea of</font>

840
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:51,229
considering this ACH encapsulation to be

841
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:53,299
used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> BF d over DX lab so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

842
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:55,009
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some questions can come and some of</font>

843
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:56,900
them i put on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list already and we</font>

844
00:49:55,009 --> 00:49:59,269
spoke about in the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> k meeting so i</font>

845
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:02,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the draft doesn't explain very</font>

846
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:04,339
well in the alternative proposal that

847
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:06,950
there is no IP header or maybe it does

848
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:08,808
but not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> every place that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

849
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:11,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think also to clarify that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LS</font>

850
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:13,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">beeping is needed only when in the</font>

851
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:16,369
second proposal and not looking the

852
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:18,829
first right yes thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

853
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:20,569
comments I appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we plan to</font>

854
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:26,019
address them after the meeting and

855
00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:28,880
respond yes the proposal currently

856
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:31,729
assumes that we're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACH</font>

857
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:37,700
encapsulation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thus there is no IP</font>

858
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:41,569
source address in VFD and part of the

859
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:44,089
bootstrapping whether it's with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ls15 or</font>

860
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:46,308
some other means because for example was

861
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:49,519
interesting discussion at the best they

862
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:52,839
have a proposal to use vgp for the

863
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:52,839
bootstrapping to distribute

864
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:59,450
discriminator through vgp yeah it came

865
00:50:55,999 --> 00:51:01,779
little bit as a new idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but it's</font>

866
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:05,080
interesting and we asked them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

867
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:09,010
share this with a BFD group for review

868
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:16,000
because there might be some conflict if

869
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:18,220
you starting LSP<font color="#E5E5E5"> BFD with your LSP thing</font>

870
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,800
and then you send with the BFD with a

871
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:23,379
different discriminator then you might

872
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,210
end up with very bad situation so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

873
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:28,450
has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> considered and very carefully</font>

874
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">so not to create race condition and</font>

875
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:35,980
mutual exclusion in a control plane but

876
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:38,919
yes so basically for EVP and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there some</font>

877
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">bgp can play some a bootstrapping role</font>

878
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,420
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the comment they made was</font>

879
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:45,670
since bgp is used any way to hold the

880
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">nlr eyes for a VPN it seems to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be mean</font>

881
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:49,360
it has to be discussed on the list but

882
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:53,080
it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place to write</font>

883
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:55,840
that that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be correlated with the</font>

884
00:51:53,080 --> 00:52:00,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">current practice of bootstrapping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VFD</font>

885
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:03,370
session<font color="#CCCCCC"> / LSP is but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

886
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:09,070
a bit more similar to similar ski BFD

887
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:11,580
right and against kim 0 yes right so

888
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:15,040
basically yes they are you advertising

889
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:19,270
your discriminator the only difference

890
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:21,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is that you are advertising root</font>

891
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:24,580
advertisers for example in case of the

892
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:26,740
bomb but the same needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be looked at</font>

893
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:32,980
as in case when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

894
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:36,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">point-to-point so obviously this one has</font>

895
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:38,860
some interesting question about where

896
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,620
this document lives right we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked the</font>

897
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:45,600
question we didn't ask the question to

898
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:49,720
mpls group but as the question to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

899
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:53,430
my personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> view that it's somewhere in</font>

900
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:55,450
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPOs and VOD more than this</font>

901
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:59,680
would be where is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion that</font>

902
00:52:55,450 --> 00:53:01,779
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> come to for my reading is that the</font>

903
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:05,440
encapsulation issues no push<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a little</font>

904
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:08,710
bit more for<font color="#CCCCCC"> best in terms of how this</font>

905
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:12,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">is meant to be utilized whereas the has</font>

906
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:14,020
a review requirement from mpls there's

907
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,310
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> much in the way of actual changes to</font>

908
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:19,120
BFD it's enough

909
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:21,850
that's correct so this may be one of

910
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:24,100
those cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> were best may be the primary</font>

00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,330
first home for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document making it</font>

review for the other two working groups

913
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:31,029
now we have them to come I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that</font>

914
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so this sounds like a conversation</font>

915
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:40,140
should get kick off with the chairs of

916
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:43,840

therefore in this list of illustration

1008
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:30,229
locations laser can you know and struck

1009
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:32,090
together get together and show the

1010
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:36,380
relationship with a bit each other

1011
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:39,230
therefore the user can use this land

1012
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:42,700
module quickly from so what is the fact

1013
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:46,820
the location and switch different

together<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1016
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:54,529
it's a something which we discussed

1017
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:57,650
yesterday and I think which greg alluded

1018
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:59,839
to also in the line meeting yesterday so

1019
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:01,640
now there's certain constructs like<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea</font>

1020
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,460
tunnels where you know the model is

1021
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:06,078
fairly complex and on the config whys

1022
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,789
and the operational wise we really do

1023
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,349
not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to duplicate that tree now</font>

1024
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:12,829
maybe we've scheme a lot we can do that

1025
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:14,480
come not sure but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you say</font>

1026
01:01:12,829 --> 01:01:16,460
do you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we spoke about</font>

1027
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,200
leaf ref or something along those lines

1028
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:23,809
so that's how you think okay should be

1029
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:28,129
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if because there's a tag</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tea</font>

1033
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:41,150
can either relativity's location and the

that eased party is a llamar do so it it

1036
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:52,819
kinda Hera takes a team adios attribute
