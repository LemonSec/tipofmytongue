00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:27,080
call for workshops that's out for ndss

144
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,050
and what might be the right context for

145
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,430
that so without further ado I'd like to

146
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,530
introduce tivo llego from ruin

147
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">University to talk about he was selected</font>

148
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,640
as our are very fancy name best

149
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">contribution to the IETF at that</font>

150
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,580
workshop Award winner and part of that

151
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,080
was we invited<font color="#E5E5E5"> him here to the ITF to</font>

152
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:53,690
meet all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all and see how the IETF</font>

153
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:55,250
works there isn't it that you want yeah

154
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,370
so first of all thanks for the

155
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,300
introduction thanks also for rewarding

156
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,570
us so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> fall</font>

157
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,120
very encouraging for my co-authors

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:08,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">EULA's omo offski York shrank from</font>

159
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,040
University and myself and yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,370
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the security of TLS</font>

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,609
research result that we have presented

164
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:21,739

conferences in the academic world<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

167
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:31,310
next step is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what we should keep in</font>

168
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,529
mind throughout this talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> two facts that</font>

169
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,890
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of point out or remind</font>

170
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:39,470
you of the first one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the current</font>

171
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">version of TLS is version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1.2 so as you</font>

172
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,730
all might know version 1.2 is currently

173
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,529
under development but this does not<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

174
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody is using this most recent</font>

175
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:51,320
version the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> widely used version is</font>

176
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,420
still is 1.0 which is from 1999 so it's

177
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,490
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> as old as windows 98 second</font>

178
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,709
edition and I guess nobody would

179
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,630
seriously consider using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows 98 in a</font>

181
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,070
all using TLS 1.0 today every day on

182
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:11,589
nearly one hundred percent of the server

183
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:15,110
survey by ssl apps yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> next like this</font>

184
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:17,930
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go too much into the</font>

186

187
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,529

188
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,079
again because relatively complex just

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:28,820
briefly<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pkc as one encryption is</font>

190
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most right use mechanism to</font>

191
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,490
transport a key from a client or server

192
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:38,000
when a TLS connection is initially set

193
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:42,380
up and it was used in all TLS versions

194
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,990
up to 1.2 in TLS it is red deprecated so

195
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,760
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not used anymore and I guess many</font>

196
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,010
cryptographers will agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

197
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,839
finally the right decision and many

198
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,899
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting for this for a</font>

199
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:56,209
long time and one reason why it's a good

200
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:59,149
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deprecate here because he is</font>

201
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:01,099
one in TLS 1.3 is that it doesn't

202
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:03,019
provide forward secrecy but the second

203
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,510
important reason is that this encryption

204
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,579
scheme is vulnerable to attacks like

205
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,319
most importantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> blyton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bahasa text and</font>

206
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:11,959
it's extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to implement</font>

207
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,990
security against all these attacks

208
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,240
the natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that we looked at</font>

209
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,070
in this work is now is it sufficient to

210
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,860
remove because he has one encryption

211
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:24,680
from TLS 1.3 in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect against</font>

212
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,840
its weaknesses there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an seemingly</font>

213
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,910
obvious answer and the answer is yes of

214
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,590
course it must be secure because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

215
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't use this encryption scheme but</font>

216
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:37,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">it turns out the disbelievers fault</font>

217
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:39,319
somewhat surprising next step is so

218
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,110
first of all how relevant the splash in

219
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bahasa tech again I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not want to go</font>

220
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,400
too much into detail yeah but I want to

221
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,630
show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been many</font>

on the slide attack one one or the other

230
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:12,260
TLS versions but there are also other

231
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:14,510
applications like MV quiche and<font color="#CCCCCC"> european</font>

233
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,920
the most popular and probably most

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,420
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important example is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

famous drone attack that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

236
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,140
heard about which was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of announced</font>

237
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,540
earlier this year end which is going to

238
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,670
be presented by<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more Avilan and his</font>

239
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:33,459
co-authors at the using security

240
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:36,469
symposium in middle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> august i think so</font>

241
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:39,200
this constant stream of publications

242
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,450
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> like kind of allowed to apply</font>

243
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,390
variants of this original version bhai

244
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:46,760
take over and over again gives no reason

245
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,740
to assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stream of</font>

246
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,810

247
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,340
so so it makes sense to analyze the

248
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,800
security of cryptographic protocols

249
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,510
under the assumption that such a text

250
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,280
will remain a realistic threat for

251
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:04,640
protocols and encryption schemes in the

252
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:07,699
future next please so how will it heal

253
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,069
is 1.3 we typically use in practice so

254
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,590
here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example first of all we have</font>

255
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,510
one web server and the web server

256
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,140
implements two different or at least two

257
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:19,790
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> versions of TLS one is e</font>

258
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,670

259
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,660
version and second is any old version

260
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,219
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for backwards</font>

261
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,790
compatibility reasons

262
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,740
such as TLS 1.0 for example and on this

263
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,660
slide here the server uses the same

264
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,490
hours a certificate and in particular

265
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,230
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours a public key for both</font>

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">cycle suits this will be very important</font>

267
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,720
for a check and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a standard</font>

268
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:44,209

269
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,370
this later in<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail and then we</font>

00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:49,099
have two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types of users one</font>

271

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,750
she's very smart and she uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the</font>

attacks may appear over and over again

282
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,420
we may assume that at least rafts

connections maybe become insecure at

284
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,128
some point in the future but at least

285
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,019
Lisa who uses only<font color="#CCCCCC"> an exclusively the</font>

286
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:27,279
most state-of-the-art crypto may expect

287
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:31,040
that he American connections are secure

288
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:34,220
it turns out to disbelieve this fault so

289
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,110
next piece and here's how the attack

290
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,879
works so the attack is a

291
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,600
man-in-the-middle attack which means

292
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:44,209
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the attacker controls basically</font>

293
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,879
the network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is able to inject</font>

294
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:49,670
arbitrary messages and drop messages so

295
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,250
what what the attacker does is the

296
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,899
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> when Lisa initiates her TLS</font>

297
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,059
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> consummate connections so she sends</font>

298
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:58,029
a client hello and exchange<font color="#CCCCCC"> keisha</font>

299
00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:00,410
message message then the attacker

300
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:02,120
responds as if the server would have

301
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,100
responded so it sends a<font color="#CCCCCC"> server hello</font>

302
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">message server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key fair message and the</font>

303
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,459
certificate message and this is easily

304
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,019
possible for the attacker because all

305
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,638
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> messages are independent of the</font>

306
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-term secret of the server so anyone</font>

307
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,529
anyone can kind of compute and sent

308
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,879
these messages the next message that the

309
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:19,040
attack has to send is a certificate

310
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">verify message and this is an important</font>

311
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,839
message where which essentially contains

312
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,370
a digital signatures or digital

313
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,279

314
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,949

318

320

321
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,340
compute this message but by performing

326
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,480
what the etiquette does in principle is

327
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,260
it leverages the weakness of the old

328
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,970
version in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> compute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

service<font color="#E5E5E5"> long term secret so yeah finally</font>

335
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,800
the attacker has successfully mounted a

336
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:23,390
man-in-the-middle attack against the TLS

337

1.3 connection attempt of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisa so this</font>

338
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:29,450
shows that even though Lisa does not

<font color="#E5E5E5">even use pkc as 11.5 encryption she is</font>

340
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,870
still vulnerable to attacks against this

341
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,280
encryption scheme which is somewhat

342
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,479
surprising and which should be

343
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,980
considered I guess in the design of

344
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:42,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">protocols next slide please so how</font>

345
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,500
relevant is this attack when most

346
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:50,179
examples of blyton velocitek tend to be

347
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:53,150
relatively say impractical because such

348
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:55,190
attacks usually take around arm in the

349
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:58,010
in the order of<font color="#E5E5E5"> several hours to several</font>

350
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,710
days or maybe even weeks and this is

351
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,180
maybe a bit too slow to to lead to

352
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,500
practical attacks against browsers

353
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,060
against user sitting in front of a

354
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,870
browse and waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a connection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

355
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:11,330
be established but every now and then

356
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,919
example 2 p.m. where such a blatant<font color="#E5E5E5"> baha</font>

357
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,159
like attacks are very practically and

358
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,780
again the most most most recent and most

359
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,610
important currently most important

360
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,700
example is to brown it dramatic by<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

361
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,320
vomit I who showed that it's possible to

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,900
fortunately required signature<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

363
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,350
verify message in a single minute on a

364
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:32,450
single CPU so without special purpose

365
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,219
high performance on fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> also by</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really aim I guess this</font>

370

discounts really is a practical and

371
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,879
valid attack and according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paper</font>

372
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,310
by noon one<font color="#E5E5E5"> OVR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Madaya</font>

373
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,900

to this attack yeah next<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece so how</font>

376
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,730
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we prevent this attack and this is</font>

377
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,870
the the the aspect of this attack that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

378
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,270
personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> found most interesting</font>

379
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,159
because the attack itself is relatively

380
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,750
simple but it turns out that it's

381
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,100
extremely difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent at least</font>

382
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,050
with the tools if we currently have on

383
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so there's one natural</font>

384
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,010
solution which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called key separation</font>

385
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,959
and key separation means that we use

386
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,670
separate keys for separate protocol its

387
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,830
separate protocol version separate

388
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,810
algorithms and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on and if</font>

389
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:31,679
you want to employ this technique then

390
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:34,679
we can try to do this by by having<font color="#CCCCCC"> tues</font>

391
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">US server certificates at a webshop one</font>

392
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,670
is the green certificate which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

393
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,960
sign to TLS version 1.3 and the second

394
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,140
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the red certificate which is</font>

395
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,030
assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to teal as 1.0 and now we may</font>

396
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,070
hope that this protects Lisa against

397
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,840
this backwards compatibility attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

398
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,760
I've just described since these are

399
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,060
accepts only the green certificate which

400
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,129
belongs to the new TLS version 1.3 and

401
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,020
this makes the vulnerability of the old

402
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,430
TLS version which uses a different set

403
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,340
of certificate and a different key

404
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,960
useless ok this is the intuition how we

405
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,780
might hope to to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> against such</font>

406
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,960
attacks unfortunately it's this doesn't

407
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">work so next slide please and the reason</font>

408
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,550
is that x.509 certificates do not

409
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,530
contain any version about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a protocol or</font>

410
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,300
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about the protocol</font>

411
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,220
version or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithms that they</font>

412
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,169
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used with which means that the</font>

413
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,840
attacker is simply able to present this

414
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">ID</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old certificate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the red one which</font>

415
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,470
belongs to a TLS one nonzero and

416
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,530
disabled to mount the same attack as

417
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,790
before so one issue that we have is that

418
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,770
certificates do not contain any

419
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,810
information about protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> version so</font>

420
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">lisa has no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way of telling whether the</font>

421
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,280
certificate that she has received

422
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,889
belongs to the TLS 1.3 implementation of

423
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,260
the server or to the TLS 1.0

424
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:49,830
implementation of the server next slide

425
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:53,129
please so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one of several</font>

426
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:55,500
moments ever further difficulties let me

there is a possibility to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

429
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,949
achieve some weak form of gear

separation in X 549

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:09,139
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 and supports to</font>

432
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:10,639
distinguish between sign only

433
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:12,469
certificates and encrypt only

434
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:15,019
certificates and this would at least

435
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,610
have prevented the attack that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

436
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:18,289
described in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this talk here so this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and 0 and TLS 1.3 however this makes</font>

440
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:31,760
supporters and at the one workshop I

441
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:33,950
talked to at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least one but also</font>

442
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,529
developer who told me<font color="#E5E5E5"> where okay we know</font>

443
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,990
oui in order to assess this possibility

444
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:41,330
but we do not check it because it will

445
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,149
kind of break user experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

446
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,039
usability so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know this content</font>

447
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:48,469
this is one problem and the second

448
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,090
problem is we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to kind</font>

449
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,880
of employee<font color="#CCCCCC"> key separation at a client</font>

450
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,080
site but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the server side and we</font>

451
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,669
looked at some major server

452
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">implementation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so in particular we</font>

453
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:01,970
looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache with mod ssl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

454
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">engines and it turned out that in party</font>

455
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,809
mode ssl we were not able not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

456
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,129
to somehow configure the server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

457
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:08,779
way such that it uses different

458
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,419
certificates for different protocol

459
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:13,130
versions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> engines this doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

460
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:15,169
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's impossible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just that we</font>

461
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,820
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> it heart and we didn't find out how</font>

462
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,980
it could work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess many many</font>

463
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,990
other server operators could have the

464
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,000
same problem and four engines it's the

465
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:26,240
case that it's possible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> UM configure</font>

466
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,470
only one single certificate so yeah so

467
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,909
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many different problems on</font>

468
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,590
client site on server side and on the

469
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:32,330
protocol level which makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

470
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:37,039
difficult to employ key separation

471
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:39,949
practice next is ok so to summarize I

472
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,529
first would like to say that finally

473
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,340
removing<font color="#CCCCCC"> our say pcs one version 1.5</font>

474
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:50,000
from TLS is a very good decision and

475
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:52,879
yeah it is yeah it's it's a step in the

476
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,470
right direction but unfortunately it is

477
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,029
not sufficient to predict against all

478
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,190
these weaknesses because TLS on

479
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:01,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">transceiver be used in coexistence with</font>

480
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:04,490
other protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> versions so the main a</font>

481
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:08,809
kind of take home a take-home message

482
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:11,330
that I would transport in the store here

483
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:14,690
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe the key separation is</font>

484
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,850
extremely important and that you should

485
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to use proper</font>

490
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:33,140
should also talk to browser and server

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,770
developers to 20 or talk them into

492
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:39,440
enabling this the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that even</font>

493
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:41,539
though we have no understood throne and

may<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may be able to fix drown at least</font>

00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:54,710
problems with plasma has to take back

500
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,380
once again yes so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of my</font>

talk thanks for your attention and I'm

502
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:08,330
happy to take your questions which<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

503
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:11,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a lot of another question but a</font>

504
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,678
quick comment not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only browsers but HSM</font>

505
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:14,809
vendors should really also<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into</font>

506
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,130
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you have an HSN for</font>

507
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:17,960
things like DNS like we are you only

508
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,700
signing data you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mark the</font>

509
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,169
key to say never<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypt anything to</font>

510
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,840
avoid the whole class of attacks and

511
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:25,010
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't seem to do that so if there's</font>

512
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,320
people in room<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk to these</font>

513
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:37,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">vendors please do yeah yeah very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

514
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:40,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">punch ow Rob well sign just another</font>

515
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:44,439
quick comment um adding an extension to

516
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:47,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">x509 saying you know only this is the</font>

517
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,610
util has 1.3<font color="#CCCCCC"> flyers unlike that adding</font>

518
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,350
extensions is not difficult just matter

519
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,240
specifying them the hard part is getting

520
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:56,830
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use them of course but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

521
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,830
writing the spec for would take an hour

522
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:03,740
um I think yeah you have near the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

523
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,020
hard part is getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ca is to issue</font>

524
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">two certificates at the same time we're</font>

525
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:11,570
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the usual thing is to get just one</font>

526
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,700
certificate learn and you have to ask

527
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:19,399
specially to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to at the same time for</font>

528
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:21,260
the same domain so maybe just just run

529
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:22,939
comment on the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agreed it's</font>

530
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,620
completely difficult I guess we should

531
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,480
decide if you want to fix this problem

532
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,770
or not and I mean if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it</font>

533
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,649
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have to do something about</font>

534
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,639
it and I mean if it's difficult then

535
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:35,889
then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check</font>

536
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,890
take a difficult problem somehow so

537
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,620
perhaps proxy certs if they were more

538
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,030
widely if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know identify</font>

539
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,459
yourself sorry this<font color="#CCCCCC"> victor have knee</font>

540
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,740
perhaps proxy certificates could be used

541
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,530
get one certificate from the ca issue a

542
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,000
per protocol proxy sir and off you go of

543
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,250
course it needs to be supported by the

544
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">various system still gets clients and so</font>

545
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,780
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but it's possible in principle ok</font>

546
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,189
so i would like to discuss this offline

547
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,940
with you because i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not familiar with</font>

548
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:08,690
proxy certificates with this concept so

549
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:11,000
hey I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work um two options you</font>

550
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,490
haven't discussed where we could simply

551
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,890
deprecated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rse key exchange all</font>

552
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:18,080
together this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of has been made more</font>

553
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:20,450
difficult because Google decided to

554
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,780
deprecate diffie-hellman which leaves us

555
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:26,620
with less compatibility options but it

556
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:29,660
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term a</font>

557
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,060
reasonable thing to do and what would

558
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,620
also be possible with the key separation

559
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,860
is if you would say you configure a

560
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:41,120
server that does<font color="#CCCCCC"> que les 1.3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only with</font>

561
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:44,570
let's say at 255 19 and RSA only with

562
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,840
other protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if going</font>

563
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:50,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that direction yeah I think these</font>

564
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">are two hex which kind of prevent this</font>

565
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:54,470
this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a text but</font>

566
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,000
but still I mean did the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

567
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,620
root of the problem where this comes

568
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,060
from is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same key for</font>

569
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,340
different algorithms and this is just

570
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:05,000
one particular example<font color="#CCCCCC"> advances a thing</font>

571
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:07,720
I mean that's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> with RSA oh I'm not</font>

572
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,420
sure I wouldn't agree at least the only

573
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:14,900
I family<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are examples</font>

574
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,520
we are for example using DSA keys for

575
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,170
encryption stuff and settings where

576
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,389
their chosen ciphertext attacks or stuff

577
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:23,090
like this so and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the root of the</font>

578
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,590
problem is that that we should use

579
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,389
different keys for different algorithms

580
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,370
let's see setting which which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

581
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,010
considered in theory and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

582
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:34,070
the only manageable setting because if

583
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,080
you want to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analyze the possible</font>

584
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,000
interdependent interdependencies between

585
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,460
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithms so if you have 100</font>

586
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,900
different algorithms and we get 10,000

587
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,460
different combinations of algorithms

588
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,290
nobody is able to analyze them are

589
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,650
properly and the simplest solution is

590
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:54,620
to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of use different keys for</font>

591
00:27:47,650 --> 00:28:03,110
different algorithms no<font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions</font>

598
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:46,070
to generate some discussion about port

599
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:49,130
scanning of private networks from inside

600

604
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:04,160
around web sockets and you'll see why as

605

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue next slide so just a quick</font>

606
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,180
overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> background about in</font>

607
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,070
browser port scanning for those who

608
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,410
aren't familiar with it I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

609
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:15,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the existing mitigations for it and the</font>

610
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:17,690
weaknesses of those mitigations and then

611
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,930
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll propose a stronger solution</font>

612
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:24,200
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> mitad via internet draft</font>

613
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:25,730
shortly before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cutoff deadline so</font>

614
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,230
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a base assumption I think we can</font>

615
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">all agree here that if there's an</font>

616
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,710
attacker that's on the internet they

617
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,929
should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any visibility at all</font>

618
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,970
into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private network that's behind a</font>

619
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,280
properly configured firewall if we don't

620
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:39,230
all hold that basic assumption then this

621
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,920
discussion will go crazy places so as we

622
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:44,510
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're on the same page there</font>

623
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,430
so just as a reasonable kind of

624
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:48,530
extension to that assumption if there's

625
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,690
a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> device on a private network</font>

626
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:53,270
that's browsing to an attacker

627
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,400
controlled web server then the attacker

628
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,260
still shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any visibility into</font>

629
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,790
this private network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

630
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:03,770
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single device browsing to that</font>

631
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:07,280
server next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide we're a little cut off</font>

632
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:09,770
here the reality of the situation though

633
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,030
is that once a single device<font color="#E5E5E5"> on private</font>

634
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,860
network browses to an attacker

635
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,810
controlled server the attacker can

636
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,870
leverage that connection to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser</font>

637
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,700
and perform this port scanning so they

638
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,919
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify devices on the private</font>

639
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,140
network by their IP addresses and they

640
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,810
can also identify the services running

641
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:31,520
on those devices by their port number

642
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:33,470
the way this<font color="#CCCCCC"> works kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a high</font>

643
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,379
level is that javascript is allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

644
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,930
make requests to arbitrary IP address in

645
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,610
port combinations and then it can time

646
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,980
the response of those requests now<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

647
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:45,110
are all considered cross-origin requests

648
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:48,440
so they are protected by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same origin</font>

649
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:50,449
policy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the timing of the responses</font>

650
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,900
of those requests aren't protected at

651
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:56,510
all by that policy so an attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

652
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:59,030
then and for hey I got a quick response

653
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,650
from this request so there must have

654
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:03,290
been something actually responding at

655
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,700
that port or it took a very long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

656
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a response so there must have</font>

657
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:11,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually been a timeout that occurred</font>

658
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:13,370
there next slide please so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

659
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:16,130
this it a little more detailed level

660
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:18,679
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some JavaScript code that will</font>

661
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:21,290
actually do some port scanning it just

662
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:24,200
iterates over that small array of port

663
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:27,379
numbers at a very one specific IP

664
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,720
address if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were to run this like I</font>

665
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,970
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I branded on a small test Network</font>

666
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,210
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> results are down there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

667
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:38,420
left it's very clear that ports 80 for

668
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:41,060
45 and 1234 we're all responding because

669
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,230
there's a very short period<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

670
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,690
the response occurred even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though I</font>

671
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,790
can't tell what the response was because

672
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:49,160
of the same origin policy I know there's

673
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,710
a service responding at those port

674
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:56,120
numbers for that IP address within the

675
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:59,090
private network so like that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

676
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,040
known technique browsers do try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

677
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,689
mitigate this in some to some extent and

678
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,870
there's two strategies that are used to

679
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:10,540
mitigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it blocking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and throttling on</font>

680
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:12,590
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand blocking is this way of</font>

681
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:15,049
identifying what are sensitive

682
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,418
ports and then saying that there can be

683
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:19,820
no outgoing traffic to those ports at

684
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:21,200
all and throttling on the other hand it

685
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,090
just kind of reduces the speed by

686
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,210
limiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the open connection number of</font>

687
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:28,520
open connections that are possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

688
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,830
makes doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind of scanning of a</font>

689
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,370
wide range of ports kind of in feasibly

690
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:37,189
slow yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's question um Alex me over</font>

691
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:40,729
I'm just wondering if an attacker could

692
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:43,909
prepare a<font color="#E5E5E5"> psalm where he would include</font>

693
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:47,419
like all the private IP addresses that

694
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:50,860
he's suspecting that the attack entity

695
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:55,309
has on the inside in his own zone here

696
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:57,918
would you then be able to circumvent the

697
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:59,720
same origin policy know what I mean I'm

698
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,210
attacking from that pop-up<font color="#E5E5E5"> of example</font>

699
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,179
calm and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepare in my soul</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously</font>

700
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:07,700
subdomains that all include all RFC 1918

701
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:10,309
addresses i synthesize them and then I

702
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,500
try WebSocket on those I hostnames

703
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:13,908
rather than the IP addresses so you're

704
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,549
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about host names not IP</font>

705
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,929
addresses that were you saying yeah I'm

706
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:22,399
not an expert in the same origin policy

707
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:26,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so so the issue the same origin</font>

708
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,129
policy it doesn't protect the timing

709
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,320
responses which is the issue here the

710
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,700
content<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all those responses is very</font>

711
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,379
well protected by the same origin policy

712
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,270
so you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break it in that</font>

713
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,220
sense I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite sure what you're</font>

714
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:40,520
what you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thicker I</font>

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,919
prepare its own file that on my server

716
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,740
that includes all the RSC 1918 addresses

717
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:48,470
for host names yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use on</font>

718
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,809
the client on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack entity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

719
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,090
those prepared host names to scan

720
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:55,700
through in the same stone from which the

721
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:58,158
original that came from yeah would that

722
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:01,250
allow me to circumvent the same origin

723
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,559
policy and even go farther than<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

726
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:11,239
out in reality yeah briefly know because

727
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:17,080
subdomains are different origins so

728
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:17,080
Richard i'm richard<font color="#CCCCCC"> barnes missile so uh</font>

730
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:25,730
yes so it briefly that attack doesn't

<font color="#E5E5E5">his own would be different origins from</font>

740
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:54,429
to work ok so moving on then mentioned

741
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:57,260
we have blocking and throttling in

742
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:59,839
browsers as far as mitigation for port

743
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,119
scanning there are a lot of limitations

744
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,549
to those mitigations though on one hand

745
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:07,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have blocking essentially a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> black</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">listing type of strategy you don't have</font>

747
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,149
a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistency amongst the</font>

748
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,220
major browser vendors looking at the

749
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,329
major browser vendors there's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60</font>

750
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,308
different port numbers that are

considered sensitive that are blocked

752
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:21,859
from this type of strategy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only six</font>

753
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:24,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those 16 are actually consistently</font>

blocked<font color="#E5E5E5"> along all major browser vendors</font>

755
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:27,680
this is not a whole lot of consistency

756
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">there it's also hard to be confident</font>

757
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,269
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> about adding additional port</font>

758
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:34,279
numbers to be blocked because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard</font>

759
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:37,368
to predict what's going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

760
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:40,430
connected to a browser at some point in

761
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:42,710
the future so can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be confident</font>

762
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:46,220
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that throttling on the other hand</font>

763
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:48,950
it does a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good job of making port</font>

764
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,680
scanning inefficient if you were to

765
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:54,200
throttle it so you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do one IP</font>

766
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,460
address port number per second it would

767
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">still take you about two hundred and</font>

771
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:09,079
attacker doesn't need to map out the

entire IP private IP space they just

773

<font color="#E5E5E5">need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where your devices are on</font>

774
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:15,380
the network and because devices are

775
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:18,440
usually clustered and are done around

776
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:21,859
known IP addresses or typical IP

777
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,799
addresses attackers can just map out a

778
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:26,808
very fractional part of the private IP

779
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:29,750
space to identify start and end points

780

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can just enumerate what ports</font>

over

multiple sessions multiple users and

787
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,799
take months to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because network</font>

788
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,290
architecture doesn't change very

789
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,700
frequently so for them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have mapped</font>

790
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,020
out your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to know what kind</font>

00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">of services you're running and where</font>

792
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:56,240
they're running could be very valuable

793
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:58,190
for them and then the last issue that i

794
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,439
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> with throttling is this WebSocket</font>

795
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,000
technique which I alluded to<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier and</font>

796
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:06,800
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the next</font>

797
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,530
slide so with the advent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5</font>

798
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,310
there's two new capabilities that were

799
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:16,310
human being and they both effects this

800
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:18,200
in browser port scanning on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

801
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,240
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> web workers which are these child</font>

802
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,009
processes that can be spawned from

803
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript and on the other hand you</font>

804
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:26,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">have web sockets which is just this</font>

805
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:29,780
communication protocol that can be used

806
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:32,990
from within javascript so the issue here

807
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that most browsers will actually</font>

808
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:38,509
place the throttling limit on each

809
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:41,660
browser process but now javaScript can

810
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:44,570
create its own processes so if a browser

811
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,690
thinks it's limiting you to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 open</font>

812
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:49,730
connections at a time but you can create

813
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:52,970
256 web workers you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have an</font>

814
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:57,020
effective scanning a space<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two</font>

815
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:58,368
hundred or sorry 2570 different open

816
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,930
connections you can have at a time so

817
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:05,359
ports that you can be scanning

818
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:06,950
simultaneously next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> please so</font>

819
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,900
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these kind of limitations to</font>

820
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:11,540
the current mitigations feel like there

821
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,400
needs to be a stronger stronger

822
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,380
mitigation in place here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

823
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,780
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of solution that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> came up</font>

824
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:21,380
with it's pretty straightforward right

825
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:23,750
now the only way that port scanning

826
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:27,950
works is by looking at the difference in

827
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:32,420
timing between the responses of of two

828
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:35,359
or two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests so if instead</font>

829
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:38,240
we made this a fixed latency for web

830
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,609
sockets when that opening handshake

831
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,020
fails just<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a fixed latency is when</font>

832
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,390
you report the error back to the

833
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,630
JavaScript environment then there'd be

834
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:49,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to distinguish this opening</font>

835
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,140
handshake failed because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

836
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,029
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a WebSocket server or this</font>

837
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,319
opening handshake failed because

838
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:56,329
I wasn't talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything there was</font>

839
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:59,179
nothing there to respond to me so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

840
00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:01,729
had that<font color="#CCCCCC"> fixed latency then there'd be</font>

841
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:05,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">no way to tell anymore here to the next</font>

842
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:07,399
slide so obviously there's a

843
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,049
disadvantage to this if we're talking

844
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">about fixing the latency we're talking</font>

845
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:15,380
about increasing the latency overall

846
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:17,479
you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the the error</font>

847
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,219
condition where you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to a non</font>

848
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:21,259
WebSocket server and you'd be holding

849
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:23,390
that error until the timeout latency

850
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:25,999
occurred but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really don't think this</font>

851
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:28,729
is a huge impact because we're talking

852
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:30,198
about increasing latency for web

853
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:31,939
applications that are already<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

854
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:33,769
errors they're having errors connecting

855
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:35,959
to their web sockets server you're not

856
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:37,609
talking about increasing latency for a

857
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:40,368
web application that's totally

858
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,959
functioning normally and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you can't</font>

859
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:44,119

there could be some fringe cases where

00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:55,369
that does impact regular usage but I

00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:08,328

<font color="#E5E5E5">after the mitigation the response times</font>

876
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:25,459
are too similar because they're all held

877
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:27,469
to some fixed latency now it could be

off a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit based on when the</font>

00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:33,619
reporting the air back to JavaScript but

881
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:35,479
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general there's no distinction</font>

884
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:45,019
is a question mark in my mind because I

refer to as connectivity checking where

917
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:55,619
there's a number of candidate addresses

that we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out which</font>

919

scenario where it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have an</font>

925
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,030
you've considered that but it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,800
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at now are you trying</font>

it if it is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> where what what</font>

932
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:24,450
increasing is the latency for the error

00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:26,400

00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,560
something where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to connect</font>

937
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,930
to something that was supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

938
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,290
and just times out that latency is

939
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:39,000
actually going to stay about the same

940
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:45,390
but that is an interesting fringe case

941
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:47,150
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't considered Pat McManus I</font>

942
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:49,618
work in the network stack for Firefox um

943
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:52,500
so thank you this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really fun</font>

944
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:54,270
you speak logically Pat McManus I work

945
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,950
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Firefox thanks for doing this I</font>

946
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,089
have another room<font color="#E5E5E5"> area to get right up</font>

947
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:01,379
close to the mic and that really

948
00:42:57,089 --> 00:43:07,020
distracts me so thank you this is this

949
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:08,280
is really useful so we I can't speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

950
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,990
the other browsers we actually do rate

951
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,180
limit the website and stuff globally so

952
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,770
you won't get the worker bonus on our

953
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,149
platform although I'm with you I don't

954
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

955
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:19,680
limiting factor for most attackers with

956
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,000
respect to

957
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,500
like essentially slowing down and

958
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,790
creating fixed delays on error

959
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,500
conditions that's a little tricky

960
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,450
because there are positive use cases for

961
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,460
those things this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how failover is</font>

962
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:31,410
dong hun groups all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

963
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">things and you go damage applications by</font>

964
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:35,040
doing that so there is some pushback

965
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:39,029
when those kinds of implementations

966
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,440
happen we do not rate limit errors or

967
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,980
connection rates or anything like that

968
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,780
it all on xhr which is really probably

969
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:49,829
the much larger vulnerability here and I

970
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:51,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone who does and I'll</font>

971
00:43:49,829 --> 00:44:05,250
leave it there rather than pointing out

00:43:51,089 --> 00:44:06,900
another vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Victor</font>

973
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:09,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">duchovny finally remember stating my</font>

974
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:12,150

975
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,880
the browser the boundaries of the

00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:19,349
internal and external network somehow

977
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:23,430
and not allow external origins to refer

978
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:25,619
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an internal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resource period and do</font>

979
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:29,279
that instead it's so degree of capella

980
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:31,200
and after Richards so I think that's

981
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,630
that's a really good point I don't think

982

<font color="#CCCCCC">you can totally say an external couldn't</font>

some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> application where hey your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cores for stuff</font>

got like huge complaints and was unable

1006
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,070
to be non-trivial to distinguish when

enterprise networks that kind of look

1013
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:49,359
like the gnats that create they create

1014
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,320
the appearance of things being private

1015

ongoing discussion about this there is

1020
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:02,410
interest in finding some sort of

1021
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:04,630
solution that may ultimately be the more

1022
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,940
productive path to having some like

consuming study group 17 and cooperation

1150
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:38,680
and collaboration with its works thank

1151
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:40,330
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks this is making him oh this is</font>

1152
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,430
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the ids are you gonna have</font>

1153
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:43,750
upload these slides because there are a

1154
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:46,149
couple of things in the middle that

1155
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:47,350
scared<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bejesus out of me i didn't</font>

1156
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,990
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had opened up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some new</font>

1157
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:51,910
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having these would be</font>

1158
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:53,200
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was in the process</font>

1159
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:54,640
of doing that when the network start a

1160
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,200
thing for me so i would they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

1161
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:06,430
uploaded to sleep it's not funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1162
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:07,720
some of these aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so for those</font>

1163
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:09,430
of us have been in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> p kicks world</font>

1164
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,569
we're used to someone having to see

1165
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:13,180
somebody's and know which ones we're

1166
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:14,350
looking for so yeah yeah some of those

1167
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:16,149
shouldn't have been there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope so</font>

1168
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:18,190
please do get them up yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the</font>

1169
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:19,960
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news is that if you have you no</font>

1170
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:21,160
issues with that you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

1171
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,530
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it about some of the work going on</font>

1172
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,810
my teeth and Bosley is the is the person

1173
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:28,060
he's coming here for not just this

1174
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:30,420
reason but but I think you're planning

1175
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:33,400
to be at ITF meetings for the next fall

1176
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:36,550
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm their ideas participants</font>

1177
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,680
for that was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons with why</font>

1178
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:42,400
I was assigned to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> job because I</font>

1179
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:44,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">know ITF and so for example we had them</font>

1180
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,869
some some contact about this this

1181
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:49,440
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> document the xans one there's</font>

1182
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:52,660
punchy liaisons we sent and so so yes

1183
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:56,350
it's are under development<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay these</font>

1184
00:54:52,660 --> 00:55:01,480
days good any other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1185
00:54:56,350 --> 00:55:04,118
thanks awesome so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a</font>

1186
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,280
question for him but um there does seem

1187
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:08,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be a problem with the 55 gig range in</font>

1188
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,660
here so some people not everybody want

1189
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:13,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">to switch to the 2.4 only you might get</font>

1190
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:15,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">better service almost I've actually gone</font>

1191
00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:18,420
back and forth and and I get

1192
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:18,420
disconnected on both

1193
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:36,430
ok so the NOC<font color="#CCCCCC"> no and there are chinese</font>

1194
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:38,950
soldiers so hello thank you hello yeah

1195
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:42,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">and talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little research we did</font>

1196
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:44,259
on the security of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCM ciphers first of</font>

1197

all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to excuse on he couldn't be</font>

1198
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:53,800
here today originally wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> drews</font>

1199
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:56,380
together can you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i read this blog</font>

1200
00:55:53,800 --> 00:56:00,280
post from<font color="#E5E5E5"> adam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Langley somewhere in in</font>

1201
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:01,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">december i think where he pointed out</font>

1202
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a potential</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font>

1203
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:10,450
aes GCM in TLS and that specifically

1204
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:14,080
that it needs an 8-byte nonce well you

1205
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:19,629
and nonce is a creation for number used

1206
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:22,360
once and<font color="#CCCCCC"> adam langer says that like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dia</font>

1207
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:25,060
only secure way to do this is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font>

1208
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:28,750
counter and if you use a random nonce

1209
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:30,220
that may be risky and that he checked

1210
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:32,680
the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> two hundred thousand</font>

1211
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:36,339
implementations and found no none that

1212
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:39,339
got this wrong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought there's</font>

1213
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:41,050
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have this idea that if there's</font>

1214
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,880
something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get wrong and it TLS</font>

1215
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:50,430
implementation then someone will get it

1216
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:54,160
wrong so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> dr. next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide yeah so</font>

1217
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:56,830
specifically in GCM if you have a nonce

1218
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,339
that's if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same nonce two</font>

1219
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:03,549
times that's the same key then you have

1220
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:05,710
two potential attacks one is relatively

1221
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:08,440
straightforward that<font color="#E5E5E5"> by X or in the two</font>

1222
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:13,240
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the X Orion of the plain texts</font>

1223
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:15,130
which leaks some information and if you

1224
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,109
know something about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data you may</font>

1225
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:20,950
decrypt something and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1226
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:22,930
attacked from anto<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrew he mentioned</font>

1227
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:26,020
this attack in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on the GCM</font>

1228
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:28,890
standardization process that you can

1229
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:32,430
extract the authentication key of the

1230
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:32,430
GCM mode

1231
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:40,109
yeah and so now what he arrest us is

1232
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:43,770
like we have this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have four bytes</font>

1233
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:47,700
that are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of given by the by the</font>

1234
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:50,460
algorithm or by the and eight fights

1235
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:54,330
that are that they implement has to

1236
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:56,340
choose and the easy way to do this

1237
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's secure is to just use a counter</font>

1238
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:02,610
so you could start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 and use one</font>

1239
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:05,069
and because it's 64 bits and that if you

1240
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:10,380
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full 64 bits that's not likely</font>

1241
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:12,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will repeat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> annonce you could</font>

1242
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:15,960
choose them at random and that as

1243
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:19,440
earlier Adam Lang we said and yeah that

1244
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:22,890
this is risky if you encrypt large

1245
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,050
amounts of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try to like get some</font>

1246
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:26,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">numbers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on how large they really have to</font>

1247
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:29,280
be you're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> going into the area of</font>

1248
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:31,530
terabytes but there may be situations

1249
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,570
where this happens or at least where you

1250
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:37,410
get to a risk that's so high that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1251
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:39,870
find it unacceptable and then you can

1252
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:41,910
just of course repeat your nonsense all

1253
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:43,830
the time like all the sending the same

1254
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:50,910
value for loans which is completely

1255
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">broken and next slide and this is the RC</font>

1256
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:57,210
TLS 1.2 and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font>

1257
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,880
problem at expect because it tells the

1258
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:01,680
implementer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay each value of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nonce</font>

1259
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,690
explicit must be distinct for each

1260
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:06,750
distinct invocation of the TCM

1261
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:09,480
encryption so it tells the implementer

1262
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:12,270
what he needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve but he doesn't</font>

1263
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:14,040
tell how to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what I had was like</font>

1264
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:16,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">before just use the counter and then</font>

1265
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything's safe that's not written in</font>

1266
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:21,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the standard the standard just assess</font>

1267
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:23,160
you have to choose distinct nonces but

1268
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:28,529
gives no guidance how to do that

1269
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:30,720
properly um yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1270
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:33,660
example of how specs shouldn't be

1271
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:38,220
written they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more explicit or</font>

1272
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:39,839
should avoid such pitfalls Kenny

1273
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,120
Patterson can you go back one slide

1274
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:44,190
please yeah what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last sentence</font>

1275
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:47,520
could you read out

1276
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:49,710
um yeah okay the nonce explicit maybe

1277
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,400
the 64 bit sequence number yeah I think

1278
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that's quite useful advice no um</font>

1279
00:59:52,400 --> 01:00:00,119
yeah I we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have made it a must but</font>

1280
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:06,210
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but there's there some</font>

1281
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:13,560
guidance but yeah yeah okay you have a

1282
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:16,109
point okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide we did an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

1283
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:20,759
wide scan and we found a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small number of</font>

1284
01:00:16,109 --> 01:00:22,348
horse with repeating notices I spend a

1285
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,540
lot of time trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> track them down</font>

1286
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:26,819
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out which devices they were am</font>

1287
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> follow that a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of member from</font>

1288
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:32,550
rattler and some of them from that's not

1289
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:36,270
just closed yet but they were used by

1290
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:39,180
Visa Visa only reacted after<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

1291
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:42,210
technique i reported about this before

1292
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:45,029
they ignored my emails and we found

1293
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:47,970
around 70,000 hosts with random monsters

1294
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:51,630
and that a large part of them were from

1295
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:52,950
IBM and from a 10 but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumed there</font>

1296
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:59,339
are more implementations that we were

1297
01:00:52,950 --> 01:01:02,490
unable to identify um yeah sorry I had a

1298
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:08,549
slide for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> effect devices so next</font>

1299
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:11,098
slide so the spec for TLS 1.3 and also

1300
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:13,470
for the church or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher they are</font>

1301
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:16,109
more explicit in they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are explicit in</font>

1302
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:18,328
how you generate that nonce and it's not

1303
01:01:16,109 --> 01:01:21,000
sent over the wire which essentially

1304
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:22,740
means if you get this wrong then your

1305
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,420
implementation won't be able to speak

1306
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:31,770
with other implementations so you will

1307
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:33,990
immediately notice yeah it's like then

1308
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:36,300
there's kind of the bigger debate of if

1309
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:38,720
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the base of an algorithm level these</font>

1310
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:41,430
issues can be avoided which is under the

1311
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,560
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of having a synthetic I</font>

1312
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:45,118
we which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the that you have an</font>

1313
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,730
initialization vector that you're not

1314
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,589
setting in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation but that</font>

1315
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:51,780
kind of gets generated out of the

1316
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:55,140
algorithm and there's currently some

1317
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:57,390
debate about standardizing ASG<font color="#CCCCCC"> cm as I</font>

1318
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:00,089
we I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there are some</font>

1319
01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:03,930
disagreement on what exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonce</font>

1320
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:08,810
misuse resistance means and but yeah

1321
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:11,669
there's development in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction so</font>

1322
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:15,080
even on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithmic level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> itself</font>

1323
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:19,170
these issues could be avoided next time

1324
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:22,610
yeah so I conclusions would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1325
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:26,790
specs should if possible avoid such

1326
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:29,730
short pitfalls for implementers which in

1327
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:33,900
this case was possible as we see now the

1328
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:35,490
PS 1.3 has been fixed that and if it's

1329
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,340
not possible then I think the spec

1330
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:43,500
should be s as explicit<font color="#CCCCCC"> as possible on</font>

1331
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:45,960
how to avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> such security issues yeah</font>

1332
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:51,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a GCM interiors want my two folds</font>

1333
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:54,000
and face in both regards yeah and what

1334
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:55,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd also like to add which is not on the</font>

1335
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,230
slides is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need better testing</font>

1336
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:01,140
for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a mistake that</font>

1337
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:03,690
obviously can happen and it's relatively

1338
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:06,960
trivial also to test for that and nobody

1339
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:09,210
body has done that before and what I'd

1340
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,790
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see is for all these kind of</font>

1341
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:14,520
issues that that are testable that we

1342
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:16,710
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a TLS test tool run</font>

1343
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:18,660
on the server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will tell me other</font>

1344
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,280
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could go wrong when it's the</font>

1345
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,960
server dated right like we had other

1346
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,840
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like people forgetting meg tracks</font>

1347
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:26,790
or forgetting petting checks or these

1348
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,160
version intolerance issues that we had a

1349
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:31,050
long debate in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GS working group and</font>

1350
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,359
all these kind of things so for

1351
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:37,350
robustness of our implementations I

1352
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:39,800
think we need better testing yeah um I

1353
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:47,029
think I was much further than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just good</font>

1354
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:47,030
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you any questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or comments</font>

1355
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:58,440
fernanda want a question is if a wheel

1356
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,930
for document that was later split in a

1357
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,030
few documents and the question if is if

1358
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:07,348
you have looked at it because this

1359
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:09,210
essentially yeah we offer a document on

1360
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:11,700
the generation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID's which is</font>

1361
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:13,530
essentially tease me we were not talking

1362
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:16,169
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-citizens being specifically</font>

1363
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:18,900
but it's the same topic so my question

1364
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:22,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">is if you had looked at it because for I</font>

1365
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:24,480
mean as far as I can see it's like

1366
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:27,059
there's like the part of the advice that

1367
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:29,700
we have in our document like answer some

1368
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:32,430
of these questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you save it</font>

1369
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:35,040
as a document on how to generate IVs yes

1370
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:37,200
not specifically for TLS because it's a

1371
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:40,230
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the last citizen it's in the</font>

1372
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft or an earthier yeah okay I didn't</font>

1373
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:44,609
know that so the last segment with

1374
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:46,829
presented and we gave examples that I

1375
01:04:44,609 --> 01:04:49,020
mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just yet another example of</font>

1376
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:51,809
why these that are generated in an

1377
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:55,040
improper way at some point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font>

1378
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:57,930
for port numbers TCP is ends

1379
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:59,460
fragmentation ideas and so on so in this

1380
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:02,009
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a particular problem</font>

1381
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,750
particular security problem but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1382
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:06,119
end of the day boils down to the same

1383
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:08,880
thing IDs being generated in the wrong

1384
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:15,540
way yeah okay so i'll definitely clear

1385
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:18,079
up a look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like so</font>

1386
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,079
thanks

1387
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:37,600
yep hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so my name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is Joe Hall</font>

1388
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:38,980
um I'm here talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft the</font>

1389
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,759
survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> of worldwide censorship</font>

1390
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:44,350
techniques next slide so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1391
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:48,520
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> me dekho who follow me I can't</font>

1392
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:50,589
see so in ITF 91 I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came in presented a</font>

1393
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,180
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rough draft of a basically a</font>

1394
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:54,850
descriptive document that talked about

1395
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:58,710
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ways that global sensors were</font>

1396
01:05:54,850 --> 01:06:01,180
messing with protocols across layers

1397
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:03,250
really the motivation here is to provide

1398
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:05,799
sort of a reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> document for</font>

1399
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,330
protocol designers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you care</font>

1400
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,070
about resilience to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:11,650
approach to this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an attack a</font>

1403
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:16,870
learn something about how to how to make

1404
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:18,850
your your protocols more resistant to

1407
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:23,920
we've worked through a series of issues

1408
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you open the slides you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

blocking ours is for protocol engineers

who might care about resistance to

slide so just quick over here are some

1425
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the changes we made when I presented</font>

1426
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:07,030
it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said there's sort of three elements</font>

1427
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,380
of any sort of censorship activity and i

1428
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:10,690
called them aggregation identify

1429
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:12,100
identification<font color="#CCCCCC"> and prevention this is</font>

1430
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:14,140
sort of from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> center literature that</font>

1431
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:17,470
talks about this kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

1432
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:20,319
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> confusing to everyone and so since</font>

1433
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:22,390
then we've added other off authors<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick</font>

1434
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,130
Finster's group at Princeton and we've

1435
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:25,930
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with prescription</font>

1436
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:27,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">identification and interference</font>

1437
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:30,700
prescription is deciding what you want

01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:33,040
to block identification<font color="#CCCCCC"> is during the</font>

1441
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:38,080
technique that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe and then</font>

1442
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:40,540

1443
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:42,340
decision to block or two rate limit or

1444
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:45,100
impair or something like that the

1445
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:47,050
traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've identified we've</font>

1446
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:49,140
added a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different points</font>

1447
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:51,100
of control that sensors may seek to

1448
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:53,680
interfere with in a variety of ways

1449
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:55,720
including certificate authorities these

1450
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:59,140
new network features like content

1451
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:00,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution networks and and services</font>

1452
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:02,650
themselves which we're starting to see

1453
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:04,870
like you know whats app in Brazil three

1454
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:06,850
times now even though the<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher-level</font>

01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">judges immediately say that that's a</font>

1456
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:11,470
disproportionate activity we also

1457
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:13,420
removed a pretty problematic statement

1458
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:16,899
where we had used<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

1459
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:18,660
TLD CH just for whatever reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1460
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:20,889
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we didn't mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imply</font>

1461
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:22,240
Switzerland actually sensors anything

1462
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:25,030
and so we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed it to something</font>

1463
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:28,000
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> foo or something like that and</font>

1464
01:08:25,029 --> 01:08:30,990
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS interference section was</font>

1465
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,390
just horrible we had used this sort of

1466
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:36,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS cache poisoning as the only sort of</font>

1467
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:38,050
technique of interference when in fact

1468
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:39,879
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I didn't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this but</font>

1469
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:41,650
apparently that's never been observed in

1470
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wild and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually sort of this</font>

1471
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:47,439
race condition where a sensor is trying

1472
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:52,240
to reply to a query from a cash before

1473
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:54,759
the authoritative the resolver can

1474
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:58,029
actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so we have added</font>

1475
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:59,200
things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do see like mangling</font>

1476
01:08:58,029 --> 01:09:01,420
and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft if you</font>

1477
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:03,490
open it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there's a something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1478
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:06,550
Stefan pointed out you know if you send

1479
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:09,939
a packet to an unallocated IP in China

1480
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:11,770
with ITF<font color="#E5E5E5"> torg in it you get no response</font>

1481
01:09:09,939 --> 01:09:14,108
but if you put a blocked or<font color="#CCCCCC"> sensor</font>

1482
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:18,130
domain like facebook com you get a

1483
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:19,570
meaningless nonsense IP address back and

1484
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:23,650
then there's lying which is where a

1485
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:25,779
sensor may specifically tell an operator

1486
01:09:23,649 --> 01:09:27,279
of a recursive resolver you're not

1487
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:30,608
allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check the authoritative for</font>

1488
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:33,969
these kinds of endpoints you need to go

1489
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:35,170
this place next slide so what next I

1490
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:37,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we're getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a point where</font>

1491
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:40,420
it's it's it's it's pretty I've done as

1492
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:42,430
much as I think of I can think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1493
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:45,460
there if you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in blocking</font>

1494
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:48,490
in current examples that might be useful

1495
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:50,770
to network engineers to look at about

1496
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:51,939
what happens on the network please read

1497
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,080
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

1498
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:55,690
anything out or if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not being</font>

1499
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:59,080
precise enough in places one big to do

1500
01:09:55,690 --> 01:10:01,509
is that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like both in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1501
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:03,489
three sections of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the types of</font>

1502
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:06,130
the sort of flow of that a sensor would

1503
01:10:03,489 --> 01:10:07,839
take to censor stuff we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1504
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:09,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually break it up into layers because</font>

1505
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,080
it just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> more sense we've done that</font>

1506
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:12,430
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> identification piece but it's</font>

1507
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,780
not yet done with interference piece

1508
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:17,380
it's just some refactoring that takes

1509
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:20,440
time one question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have for folks it's</font>

1510
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:22,660
you know we saw this with the attempted

1511
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:24,280
coup in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Turkey where some of the stuff</font>

1512
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:27,070
is evolving right now and so the

1513
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:29,440
document in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sense needs to learn about</font>

1514
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:32,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff over time to really be</font>

1515
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,519
helpful and you know in when the coup is

1516
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening we were sitting there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watching</font>

1517
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,239
a whole bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different types of</font>

1518
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:39,850
techniques we saw DNS filtering

1519
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:41,949
happening we saw route miss

1520
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:44,080
announcements as well to block stuff

1521
01:10:41,949 --> 01:10:46,540
across different ISPs all at the same

1522
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">time it's totally unclear to me you know</font>

1523
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:49,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">if they were all ordered to do that if</font>

1524
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:50,860
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that was probably a</font>

1525
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:52,690
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea give it was going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1526
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:56,170
what I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to tell what was</font>

1527
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:58,210
happening there we have gotten at an<font color="#E5E5E5"> IR</font>

01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:59,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">TF in the human rights protocol</font>

1529
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:02,170
considerations group<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've thought about</font>

1530
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,570
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know putting this document into</font>

1531
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:07,360
there is sort of a descriptive reference

1532
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:08,650
document that might be useful but we got

1533
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,630
some feedback that it would benefit from

1534
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:13,629
the IETF process from actually having

1535
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:16,390
folks look at it having a call and so

1536
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:18,250
that's why I'd like to consider getting

1537
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:21,190
security 80 sponsorship one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1538
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:22,930
wonderful security IDs and I'd like this

1539
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:25,000
as i said in<font color="#E5E5E5"> honolulu if you were there</font>

1540
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:26,410
i'd like this to be the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

1541
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,120
stream of documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

1542
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:30,430
helpful in you all to designing your

1543
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:32,230
protocols so for example traffic

1544
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:37,030
analysis i know that's a huge subject

1545
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:39,309
that is not nearly as sort of um as easy

1546
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:40,809
intractable<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you know blocking and</font>

1547
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:43,930
filtering and those kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things or</font>

1548
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:45,130
censorship maybe but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1549
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:47,260
helpful because a lot of it there's

1550
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:49,060
people amongst us that know quite a bit

1551
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:52,239
about traffic analysis there's people

1552
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:53,890
that have no clue about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and it may be</font>

1553
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:56,739
helpful to have something lying around

1554
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:58,150
that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to the people who are</font>

1555
01:11:56,739 --> 01:12:00,190
designing protocols that might want to

1556
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:05,370
refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it or otherwise learn from it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1557
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:05,370
think that's it yeah

1558
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:16,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so any comments questions okay so</font>

1559
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:21,239
I'm how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this how many</font>

1560
01:12:16,139 --> 01:12:24,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">people read this document okay 11 and</font>

1561
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:26,070
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people take a document like</font>

1562
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:32,699
this might be useful as an informational

1563
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:34,559
RFC loads okay all right so I guess I'd

1564
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:38,820
encourage you to go read the document

1565
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:40,139
give Joe your feedback and I guess we

1566
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:42,059
have a look at ourselves ago haven't I

1567
01:12:40,139 --> 01:12:44,460
haven't seen it since way back when and

1568
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we'll see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we yeah progresses as</font>

1569
01:12:44,460 --> 01:13:07,530
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> information literacy right yeah</font>

1570
01:12:47,760 --> 01:13:11,330
thanks and y<font color="#E5E5E5"> over Magnus hi yes you are</font>

1571
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:14,610
here so this is about writing a

1572
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:19,050
replacement document for RC 3552 and

1573
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:22,830
there is no 00 draft that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steven and</font>

1574
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:25,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kathleen asked me me and Magnus to write</font>

1575
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:30,000
this and the only way you can get a

1576
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:38,969
without 00 draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> ism if the ad is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> askew</font>

1577
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:41,730
so next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so RFC 3552 was</font>

1578
01:13:38,969 --> 01:13:45,949
published in<font color="#E5E5E5"> july of 2003 that's 13</font>

1579
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:50,129
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and as an ib document it</font>

1580
01:13:45,949 --> 01:13:51,949
follows RFC 22 23 which required every

1581
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:55,170
RFC to have a security considerations

1582
01:13:51,949 --> 01:14:00,030
though this is instructions of how to

1583
01:13:55,170 --> 01:14:01,949
how to do that it has extensive sections

1584
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:04,320
about the goals of security and the

1585
01:14:01,949 --> 01:14:06,500
internet model and it has a very

1586
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,909
extensive section with 13 pages of

1587
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:11,659
common issues both in security

1588
01:14:08,909 --> 01:14:15,790
requirements and security solutions and

1589
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:19,969
pretty much that is why we need a new

1590
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:24,050
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC because that section is kind</font>

1591
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:26,780
of outdated the common issues are no

1592
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:32,090
longer common different issues so next

1593
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:34,580
slide so there's some outdated

1594
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:38,720
information mentioned of protocols

1595
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:43,040
algorithms our concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> of privacy has</font>

1596
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:47,630
evolved and in part by publishing a

1597
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:49,460
needle RFC but in general there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1598
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:52,280
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the internet environment from</font>

1599
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:56,930
what it was in 2003 this pervasive

1600
01:14:52,280 --> 01:15:00,980
monitoring just as an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we are</font>

1601
01:14:56,930 --> 01:15:03,260
considering using adding draft gone to

1602
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:07,459
numeric IDs second<font color="#CCCCCC"> situations into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1603
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:11,210
it's not decided yet what's up to the

1604
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:14,810
list and perhaps adding something about

1605
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:16,610
opportunistic security some special

1606
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:18,950
cases that we think need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be handled</font>

1607
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:21,830
there's extension documents there's lots

1608
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of documents that extend some existing</font>

1609
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:26,300
protocol and then you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

1610
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:28,490
considerations it says oh the master

1611
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:31,460
document then it's all in there yeah

1612
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:34,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's fine and sometimes that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1613
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:36,260
sometimes it's not and you want to have

1614
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:40,430
guidance about when it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and when</font>

1615
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:42,230
it is not and also there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some use</font>

1616
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:44,810
usage documents for specific

1617
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:47,570
applications of general generalized

1618
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:52,580
frameworks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need some text</font>

1619
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:55,580
above that so next slide okay so example

1620
01:15:52,580 --> 01:16:01,070
of outdated information section<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 52</font>

1621
01:15:55,580 --> 01:16:03,320
recommends using SSL or TLS 1.0 SMI is

1622
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:07,429
described there as something that is too

1623
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:09,830
new to have seen why deployment one

1624
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:13,550
section before that recommends using aah

1625
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:18,530
where aah is pretty much pulled out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1626
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:21,350
most ip6 tax by now it also states that

1627
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:23,929
both h and ESP are mandatory for ipv6

1628
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:26,600
and that's been relaxed for royalty at

1629
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:30,110
least well it has been relaxed in

1630
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:32,429
general because of the needs of<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT</font>

1631
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:34,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no mention of algorithm</font>

1632
01:16:32,429 --> 01:16:38,100
selection no mention of algorithm

1633
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:39,510
agility no mention of<font color="#CCCCCC"> aedes theirs is</font>

1634
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:42,690
quite a bit of mention of

1635
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:45,270
non-repudiation that most of us have

1636
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:50,610
decided that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a meaningful</font>

1637
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:53,100
meaningful concept and there's a example

1638
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:57,500
of making secure purchases over s mine I

1639
01:16:53,100 --> 01:17:00,510
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's taken off so well so</font>

1640
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:03,719
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something section three</font>

1641
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:07,410
point two point one password sniffing it

1642
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:10,890
mentions protocol such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> telnet pop and</font>

1643
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:14,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">then TP but no mention of HTTP are all</font>

1644
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:20,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">off both are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty much vulnerable to</font>

1645
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:23,519
this so next slide okay so privacy is

1646
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:28,679
amost of this is just most of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1647
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:31,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">need is just referencing RFC 69 73 some</font>

1648
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:34,610
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> considered a time</font>

1649
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:37,350
but now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think are important is the</font>

1650
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:39,989
compromises of store data correlation

1651
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:43,679
between different streams different

1652
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:46,650
protocols even identification secondary

1653
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:50,070
use anonymity versus pseudonymity and

1654
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:53,280
data minimization of these are covered

1655
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:55,940
very well in RFC 69 73 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to at</font>

1656
01:17:53,280 --> 01:18:00,809
least mention them and reference the

1657
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:04,469
appropriate sections so<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide so</font>

1658
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:08,190
changes in environment well while talked

1659
01:18:04,469 --> 01:18:11,550
a lot about pervasive monitoring and RFC

1660
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:15,120
3552 distinguishes off paths and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

1661
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:18,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacks attacks there are also</font>

1662
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:20,640
distinction between passive and active

1663
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:23,370
attacks and although it's not stated

1664
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:26,520
explicitly it's assumed that on path

1665
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:30,019
attackers can do either passive or

1666
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:33,500
active it will and what we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1667
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:36,840
pervasive monitoring is that the

1668
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:40,530
pervasive monitor can do very

1669
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">large-scale passive although it is on</font>

1670
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:46,480
path

1671
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:48,730
so does this matter welcome at us for

1672
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:52,570
some protocols doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter some then</font>

1673
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:54,549
we should have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> text describing when</font>

1674
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:58,059
went to talk about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what you have</font>

1675
01:18:54,550 --> 01:19:00,190
to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> so other changes in the</font>

1676
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:02,980
environment is what is referred<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is</font>

1677
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:06,849
the death of the perimeter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and familiar</font>

1678
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:09,070
with the term it's the fact that this

1679
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:13,630
corporate laptop that Kathleen has

1680
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:16,360
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no sorry you don't</font>

1681
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:18,700
connect it at work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I like this</font>

1682
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:22,059
one ok so the phones we all have here

1683
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:26,170
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on to the corporate Wi-Fi</font>

1684
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:29,410
network sometime next week<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

1685
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:32,790
so so whatever malware they pick up here

1686
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:36,130
bring to the place behind the firewall

1687
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:38,650
and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of UDP based protocols</font>

1688
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:42,250
that we didn't have in 2003 and the TLS

1689
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:46,719
that also wasn't available 2003 hey so

1690
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:49,989
next time so the plan we run term to

1691
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:52,540
submit a 0-0 draft by September probably

1692
01:19:49,989 --> 01:19:57,580
a lot earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably very early August</font>

1693
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:59,560
that will lead just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3550 to changing</font>

1694
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:03,150
the author names and doing whatever is

1695
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:06,370
necessary to get it past the ID nets and

1696
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:09,269
then we hope to have an extensive

1697
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:14,559
discussion on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sag mailing list and</font>

1698
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:18,460
publish two or three revisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> bye bye</font>

1699
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:21,760
soul and need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to revise the exam</font>

1700
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:25,410
examples make more<font color="#E5E5E5"> weekly more modern</font>

1701
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:28,239
and have more discussions at the IKF 97

1702
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:32,110
hopefully I ITF last call early next

1703
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:34,900
year so like it says their comments are

1704
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:40,719
silver text is gold so please<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it to</font>

1705
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:43,089
us and neck site yeah so one finger for

1706
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:45,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">now the discussion is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen on</font>

1707
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:48,989
this cyclist if we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the volume</font>

1708
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:55,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">is very great and we might want to the</font>

1709
01:20:48,989 --> 01:21:00,120
mailing list all<font color="#CCCCCC"> for on our own yes very</font>

1710
01:20:55,050 --> 01:21:03,660
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barry liebe in the there we go</font>

1711
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:07,019
in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the area formerly known as app we</font>

1712
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:10,019
have a list of app issues that people

1713
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:12,030
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider on a wiki page now</font>

1714
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:14,850
that's turned out to be useful to

1715
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:16,469
appoint people to and I suggest not as

1716
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:19,080
an alternative to doing this kind of

1717
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:21,600
update periodically but that this

1718
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:25,110
document points at a wiki<font color="#CCCCCC"> page in the</font>

1719
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:27,060
security area that has hot issues things

1720
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:30,269
that have changed since the last version

1721
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:32,790
of this BCP put it put the pointer in

1722
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:35,340
the document and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then as things develop</font>

1723
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:37,890
you can start listing them there while

1724
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:39,780
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> preparing the next revision so</font>

1725
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:43,890
that people are alerted to it that's a

1726
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:46,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">good idea thank you Paul Hoffman this is</font>

1727
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:48,930
actually a question for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80s I have</font>

1728
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:50,520
proposed before and gotten some good

1729
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:52,980
some positive response and negative

1730
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,560
response on the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that must and</font>

1731
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:57,030
should should not appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

1732
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,640
considerations unless they are

1733
01:21:57,030 --> 01:22:03,750
duplicates of stuff before and maybe not

1734
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:05,040
um should I start<font color="#E5E5E5"> this before the 00 or</font>

1735
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:06,510
should we wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the zeros or I don't</font>

1736
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to get it in too late because a lot</font>

1737
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:09,240
of people agreed with me but a lot of

1738
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:12,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">people didn't when would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you like that</font>

1739
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:15,150
to come up send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the list I</font>

1740
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,290
think okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the 00 I'm one of the</font>

1741
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:18,120
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who disagree with you yeah yeah</font>

1742
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:20,760
so that's why i was asking so do it

1743
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:25,380
before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 00</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think so yeah okay great</font>

1744
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:33,930

thanks and look forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to coordinating</font>

1748
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:48,000
the pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1749
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:52,049
considerations in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web security</font>

1750
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:54,090
reviews so could we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a bunch of</font>

1751
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:56,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">people to agree to have a read of this</font>

1752
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:59,850
and a reread of this and give us

1753
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:02,160
comments great thank you great so unless

1754
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:04,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you heard and the authors are planning</font>

1755
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:07,110
on putting a 0-0 out by what did you

1756
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:08,660
think early august early<font color="#CCCCCC"> august so if</font>

1757
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:12,200
this week is a good time

1758
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:13,670
Johnson<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but sooner is better for</font>

1759
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:17,450
anything so if you any issues and

1760
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:19,720
raising this one kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> caveat I would</font>

1761
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:21,620
look at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and came out much shorter</font>

1762
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:26,570
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that'd be more useful</font>

1763
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:28,340
but I I I think that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great goal but</font>

1764
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:34,219
you know we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the right thing</font>

1765
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:35,600
here but yes i'm pickin up yeah like

1766
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:37,910
that some tricks up our sleeves how we

1767
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,200
can make this shorter but let's take

1768
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:42,200
that on a list when we start

1769
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:45,980
restructuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the documents or or fixing</font>

1770
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:47,300
anything so great<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks again</font>

1771
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:52,040
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> being willing to do this I think</font>

1772
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:55,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's very useful yes thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i</font>

1773
01:23:52,040 --> 01:24:05,210
think that brings us to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> mic yeah do</font>

1774
01:23:55,550 --> 01:24:07,130
me okay floor is yours so there were a

1775

couple of people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have asked for</font>

1776
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:12,440
presentation time and we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1777
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:13,940
didn't have it and they said they would

1778
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:20,389
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mic just to say their thing</font>

1784
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:38,240
have people take a quick look at the

1785

what they think so if you have if you

1809
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:51,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">have interest or comments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or questions</font>

please join us in potsdam one right

1811
01:25:51,909 --> 01:26:04,179
after this hi the selected company I'm

1812
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:07,449
monitoring<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane deployment these days</font>

1813
01:26:04,179 --> 01:26:10,289
and I noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that many folks are still</font>

1814
01:26:07,449 --> 01:26:12,610
running rather obsolete DNS SEC servers

1815
01:26:10,289 --> 01:26:14,829
that historically have been adequate

1816
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:18,239
they returned correct answers<font color="#CCCCCC"> for valid</font>

1817
01:26:14,829 --> 01:26:21,190
data but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they rather fail badly at</font>

1818
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:23,888
denial of existence and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1819
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:25,268
important for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane and email because bad</font>

1820
01:26:23,889 --> 01:26:27,159
denial of existence looks like a

1821
01:26:25,269 --> 01:26:29,469
man-in-the-middle attack downgrading the

1822
01:26:27,159 --> 01:26:32,440
non-existence of your TLS a records and

1823
01:26:29,469 --> 01:26:34,179
the like so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will start to cause email</font>

1824
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:37,299
delivery problems for the few and the

1825
01:26:34,179 --> 01:26:39,789
brave or starting to implement Dane so

1826
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:41,530
please please<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that your DNS</font>

1827
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:43,809
server is a reasonably current and

1828
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:47,139
aren't 10 or so years old and running

1829
01:26:43,809 --> 01:26:54,179
old specs or buggy and the like that's

1830
01:26:47,139 --> 01:26:57,369
all you're unsure for a quick

1831
01:26:54,179 --> 01:27:00,400
advertisement will just republished the

1832
01:26:57,369 --> 01:27:06,880
RFC on running code the implementation

<font color="#CCCCCC">status section as a bcp it's RFC 17 9 42</font>

1835
01:27:09,999 --> 01:27:15,369
so if you have an implementation or

1836
01:27:12,309 --> 01:27:18,539
implementations please document them for

1837
01:27:15,369 --> 01:27:21,339
the benefit of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups</font>
