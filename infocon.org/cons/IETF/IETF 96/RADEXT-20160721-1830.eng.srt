how far our documents have come we have

<font color="#E5E5E5">coming in this is actually quite a lot</font>

108
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,460
on our plate and we have to decide at

109
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,400
some point which of those we want to

110
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,169
adopt this working group drafts so one

111
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,859
graft is pretty much set as soon as it

112
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:21,900
exists and that is the radius of a TLS

113
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:26,670
let's call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this document the current</font>

114
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:30,590
RC<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6614 is experimental and also needs</font>

115
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:33,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be double refreshment for TLS 1.3 so</font>

116
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,789
jim has kindly volunteered to edit<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

117
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,909
document

118
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,280
to be the editor and so let's discuss it

119
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:43,870
today and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some point see draft about</font>

120
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:47,619
it then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is laura1 authentication</font>

121
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:51,250
in radius lower one is this low-power

122
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,410
radio wide area network and they have

123
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,650
their very unique authentication needs

124
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:59,160
and there is graphed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one also</font>

125
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,659
submitted just before the cutoff which

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,300
describes how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to authenticate with lower</font>

127
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,620
one and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some point from looking at</font>

128
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,510
the document at least some new radius

129
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,670
attributes would be needed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

130
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,070
some reshaping of how this is actually

131
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:16,150
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done so again there is a</font>

listen and comment the next one is

134
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,520
radius extensions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> network assisted</font>

135
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,680

on the table today because the authors

142
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,560
have indicated they would really want to

143
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,350
have this as a working group document so

144
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,950
I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should discuss about the fate</font>

145
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:52,720
of this one then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a as a last</font>

146
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,440
document the extended packet header for

147
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,330
radius which is fairly new<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so this is</font>

148
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,170
no submitted also just before the

149
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:09,280
deadline and yeah so let's see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

150
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:12,280
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about based on discussions with Jim</font>

151
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,099
and Bernard and Stefan this week I

152
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,690
suspect there may be another document

153
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,780
which would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful which would be</font>

154
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,900
radius proxy considerations which is

155
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,900
really a bit different than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP or</font>

156
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,289
TLS document and it's what do you do

157
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,729
when you cross protocol boundaries or

158
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:34,750
you know what do you do when you're when

159
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:37,060
you have layers of proxy chains to just

160
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,309
again expanding things which are not

161
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,380
documented now<font color="#CCCCCC"> are poorly implemented</font>

162
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,968
are unknown

163
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah so first of all thanks for sparking</font>

164
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,300
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the betting is</font>

165
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,160
already on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this since we have five</font>

166
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes of leeway in the end probably we</font>

167
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:56,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">can just talk about it at any point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

168
00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:00,620
so that let's first discuss these active

169
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">work group drafts arm we have the cui</font>

170
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,240
proxy document<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave it five minutes</font>

171
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually there's not a lot to talk about</font>

172
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it was happy if you just take one</font>

173
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:15,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it let me just pull up the</font>

174
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,790
slides and then let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

175
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:27,640
just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the slides there really</font>

176
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,980
isn't much changed from the last IETF

177
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,360
proxy spoofing can always be done you

178
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,820
know the proxies can do anything they

179
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,370
want Peter<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deacon had some comments I'm</font>

180
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,820
not entirely sure what he meant by them

181
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:44,149
and i did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get clarification so</font>

182
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:50,660
barring clarification we can go with the

183
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:54,459
document as is um go ahead so there were

184
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:58,540
updated text so the main issue is that

185
00:09:54,459 --> 00:10:02,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> coa server which is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nazz</font>

186
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,510
must treat all attributes as mandatory

187
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:08,029
if it doesn't understand it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends a</font>

188
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:10,880
co a knack with an error cause of

189
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:15,110
unsupported attributes the issue is

190
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,600
their attributes added by proxies on the

191
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:21,529
outbound path which really should also

192
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,209
be sent on the inbound path but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

193
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:26,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to delete those attributes before they</font>

194
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:30,939
get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAS because their proxy</font>

195
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:34,010
signaling attributes not<font color="#CCCCCC"> nazz attributes</font>

196
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,520
and so the discussion here is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

197
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:40,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with text which says bar by and</font>

198
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,920
large anything proxies add outbound they

199
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,140
delete going back so when the packet

200
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,270
gets to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nez it knows nothing about</font>

201
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,720
any kind of proxy stuff what I've seen

202
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:54,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">in in practice is the proxy state</font>

203
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,319
attribute going from a co a client

204
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:59,809
to the nas and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nazgûl I don't</font>

205
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:02,599
understand proxy state and sending a co

206
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:04,819
a knack back which is dumb but you could

207
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,790
argue it sort of makes sense from

208
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:10,519
reading 50 176 so this is meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

209
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,860
future proof<font color="#CCCCCC"> too simple hopefully</font>

210
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:15,199
hopefully understandable so all

211
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,819
attributes added by a radius proxy when

212
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:19,128
sending packets from the visited network

213
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:20,660
to the whole network must be removed by

214
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:23,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">the corresponding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CEO a package from</font>

215
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,329
proud proxy from packets would travel

216
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:28,488
the reverse path so then as only<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

217
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:31,128
sees attributes that its end up stream

218
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:36,739
or that the upstream is intending to

219
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:38,360
send to it to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> see oh yeah my only</font>

220
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:41,179
question is if this is really foolproof

221
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,999
in the sense that the authentication

222
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:46,579
path could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from the CUA</font>

223
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:48,739
path so you don't necessarily travel by

224
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:49,670
the same ops so you don't know what you

225
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:53,689
have to remove because you never

226
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:56,599
actually saw the baggage yes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

227
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:59,599
document of some other text about you

228
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,149
know we sort of assume that there's

229
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,819
mostly a one-to-one mapping between the

230
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:08,629
upstream and the reverse path and that

231
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:12,139
the upstream proxy can talk to the CEO a

232
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:13,699
proxy which sends things backwards right

233
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:15,019
if the pads are completely different

234
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,769
than who knows what the hell goes on

235
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:20,509
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost impossible to know</font>

236
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:23,929
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter deacons comments were that</font>

237
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:25,939
the CEO a proxy did not talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

238
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:29,420
radius proxy and was incapable of

239
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:31,248
talking to the radius proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the</font>

240
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,519
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that was well then I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

241
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:36,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do any of this right if you</font>

242
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,569
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're tightly coupled then</font>

243
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:40,910
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight forward if you don't</font>

244
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:43,368
tightly couple them please write a

245
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,279
document suggesting what to do and he

246
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:48,549
didn't it's a use case<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

247
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,549
to solve

248
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:59,150
yeah okay I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it next slide</font>

249
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,840
but I think there's any questions well

250
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:05,770
as all the all the explanations so any

251
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:11,980
questions comments from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room</font>

252
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:11,980
everyone's happy or overloaded all right

253
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,130
one cushion are regarding the first

254
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:21,740
comment forgetting Peter deacon so you

255
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:24,140
are expecting what from him or it would

256
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,180
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to get an explanation as to what</font>

257
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,449
concerns he had and how they could be

258
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,890
addressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so at least we can we can</font>

259
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,420
we can say that on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mini me's and</font>

260
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:44,600
saying that if there is no more comment

261
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:47,900
we can move on okay okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you so</font>

262
00:13:44,600 --> 00:14:10,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next presentation is done actually</font>

263
00:13:47,900 --> 00:14:12,530
are my own so p0 second so so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

264
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">shorts that is updated about the ypres</font>

265
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,550
sponsored entity which has got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fair</font>

266
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,840
bit of discussion last time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font>

267
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,380
we were able to solve all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these issues</font>

268
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,760
so next slide if you do look at the

269
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">burners like a slight lag there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are six</font>

270
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,480
issues which came up on the rainiest and

271
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,240
which we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> extensively I've</font>

272
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,410
basically fixed all of those um in

273
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,970
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that I promised in the</font>

274
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:35,270
winners iOS meeting I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would do some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SC</font>

275
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,890
art to describe the use case behind this

276
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,870
a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better actually I didn't do that</font>

277
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,390
yet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another ref with</font>

278
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,010
just the SQ out basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I hate</font>

279
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and I have to find the will power to</font>

280
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,540
actually do them I have put something in

281
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,880
this lighter here to explain this this

282
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:53,660
use case though so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> flows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> addressed</font>

283
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:56,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">yard really soon the real discussion</font>

284
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,920
point i have now with it is now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i've wrapped my head around these use</font>

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,019
cases about when are multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> rachel's</font>

287
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:05,649
available

288
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:07,869
the texts has done some<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledgment</font>

289
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:14,110
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the identity selection hints in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

290
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:17,589
e.r SC on which some thought could our

291
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:19,480
fix the problem in a more easy way the

292
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,790
more I look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this I believe the</font>

293
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,619
identity selection well it's actually

294
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,498
<font color="#CCCCCC">rather implemented pretty much anywhere</font>

295
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:28,619
and if it were it only has 256 bytes to

296
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:33,279
transmit identity information which is

297
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:35,529
way too few to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> useful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but even if it</font>

298
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,689
were sufficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it still doesn't</font>

299
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:40,569
solve the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think the text</font>

300
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:42,099
about identity selection hints can

301
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:43,118
basically just go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

302
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,600
doesn't contribute to the problem

303
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:49,420
solving or<font color="#E5E5E5"> explicitly say it doesn't</font>

304
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">help now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

305
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:55,149
on this next slide and this is here this

306
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,730
wonderful s yard so when the use case

307
00:15:55,149 --> 00:16:00,160
basically came in prominently with the

308
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:02,399
new Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> line specification on past</font>

309
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,059
point or also<font color="#CCCCCC"> hotspot to point though</font>

310
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,360
depending on how you want to call it

311
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:09,368
both names exist so let's assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

312
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,839
user<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a device with a sim card in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

313
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:16,509
and the operator has<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre-configured the</font>

314
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,420
device so that authenticates with the

00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:22,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">sim card</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cellular networks just like</font>

316
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:25,299
as usual but also that it is allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

317
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:28,089
use all Wi-Fi access points which have

318
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:30,660
passed point enabled and indicate in

319
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:35,110
their beacons support for this specific

320
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">MNC MCC combination um that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

321
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,129
config item in itself and there's

322
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:41,498
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with that the user from</font>

323
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:43,949
that device also has a credential for a

324
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:45,999
other Roman consortium just for Wi-Fi

325
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:48,758
let's form of the suits<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eduroam</font>

326
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:51,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">Roman consortium and he has a config</font>

327
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,860
pushed into his device which says<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you</font>

328
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,649
can use this credential for the Wi-Fi

329
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:59,290
network with the SSID<font color="#CCCCCC"> eduroam</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or for any</font>

330
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,149
other Wi-Fi pass network which indicates

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,248
support for the roaming consortium

332
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:07,449
identifier and then there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this 5</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x</font>

336

337
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:19,480
those two credentials the one is fuji TV

network<font color="#CCCCCC"> torg and tell dice whatever it</font>

339
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,919
is at some point the<font color="#CCCCCC"> authenticator has</font>

340
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:27,809
to decide who can authenticate this user

341
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,309
so should i send the EAP requests to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

342
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:32,918
observer at the cellular network to an

343
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:35,678
ebay k prime or should<font color="#E5E5E5"> i send it to the</font>

344
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:39,730
radio server theorem consortium doing EP

345
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,559
GLS nothing wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that so on the</font>

346
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:45,100
trouble starts when the authenticator

347
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:47,770
next slide actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an access point</font>

348
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,270
which has both criteria enabled so let's

349
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,610
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a Wi-Fi access point with an</font>

350
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:54,340
SSID that is fubar so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not relevant</font>

351
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,830
here that it indicates you are allowed

352
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,230
to connect to me if you have a sim card

353
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,449
with this specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> mcmc combination and</font>

354
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,490
you're also allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to me and</font>

355
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,870
that will authenticate you if you have a

356
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,210
credential with this past<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

357
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,100
consortium end in fire now the device

358
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,160
looks up its local config and realizes

359
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,110
gosh actually I have a credential and I

360
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,570
can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this cell</font>

361
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,729
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider my list and I also have a</font>

362
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,290
TLS credential and I can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

363
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,580
i have this consult some<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify and my</font>

364
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:28,678
list so the client configuration simply

365
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:32,500
knows it has the choice to use both at

366
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,940
some point it has to try one um if that

367
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work at twice the other the</font>

368
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,169
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is and that's what the</font>

369
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:42,059
document is all about when you try both

370
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:45,340
um always<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the realm identifier which</font>

371
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:47,260
matches your actual user identifier so

372
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,720
then just magically assume that you can

373
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,270
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> one realm identifier and it will</font>

374
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,370
try both methods in a row it just can't

375
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,200
do that because the routing depending on

376
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,059
the realm identifier might add that

377
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,620
might put you into a place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

378
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:03,490
one of those will work and the other one

379
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,159
will never be tried this is the basic

380
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,480
problem space we are working in and

381
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,100
actually could exist also for wired

382
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,440
networks but these use cases are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font>

383
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,750
more more special it's basically

384
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,510
everywhere where the where the

385
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:20,650
authenticator cannot or indicates more

386
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:22,870
than one possibility to authenticate now

387
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,970
the problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the identity selection</font>

388
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,560
hints is if you are

389
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,300
put into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authenticator into the</font>

390
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,070
Wi-Fi access point the<font color="#E5E5E5"> identity</font>

391
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,780
selection hints it simply does not help

392
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,629
because the Wi-Fi access point would

393
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,750
send in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EEP request identity but you</font>

394
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,210
can use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> or that and the choice for</font>

395
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,430
the client is not narrowed down because

396
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,700
well they're both usable so they can

397
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:48,320
both be indicated in this message so it

398
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,370
just doesn't contribute to the problem

399
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:55,399
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the identity selections</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exist in</font>

400
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,770
principle so since they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

401
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,700
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer to reject them out and just</font>

402
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:03,680
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's it and that is</font>

403
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually the one issue I have so I</font>

404
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,450
wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> what people think of that mmm i</font>

405
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,879
would like to push out a new ref with

406
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,440
ascii art and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hope that the</font>

407
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,850
document has gotten enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting that</font>

408
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:23,780
we can actually move forward to a

409
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:29,060
working group last call so this is alan

410
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:32,870
i have a question on<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh not better is</font>

411
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:36,020
that better yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mics are confusing</font>

412
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:38,810
here i have a question an implementation

413
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,840
so how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this change existing</font>

414
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:44,570
implementations and who has to do this

415
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,419
and are all the access point vendors

416
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:51,830
aware they have to do this and are on

417
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:53,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">board</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it so this is a bigger</font>

418
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,389
question than just the supplicant side

419
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,980
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can say is that the mention of</font>

420
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,200
Wi-Fi access point manufacturers do

421
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,200
implement pass point these days so you

422
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">can just buy new cisco gear and or any</font>

423
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,090
other window and it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a config</font>

424
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,750
option to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the implementation</font>

425
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:13,580
quality as always varies we have seen

426
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all the major all vendors on the</font>

427
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,260
client side also indicate support for

428
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:21,170
past point so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft Windows</font>

429
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,660
10 there is also X iOS and even Android

430
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:26,150
in its newest version has the API is to

431
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,460
configure a pass point and react upon

432
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,800
beacons with pass point so in principle

433
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,890
the infrastructure is there actual

434
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,590
deployment I don't know we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

435
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,300
at this and at your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own especially on</font>

436
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,889
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client-side implementations also</font>

437
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,350
vary in quality

438
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,610
on the lower end of the scale so we're

439
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">not quite happy with what we see there</font>

440
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:50,659
but it is a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can come your</font>

441
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:53,450
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and if I could add actually</font>

442
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,760
the reason why I realized this issue a

443
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,010
long time ago was way before past<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

444
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,540
was basically unique ignorant a

445
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:03,170
supplicant manufacturer in a mobile

446
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone which basically said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

447
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,260
have as many credentials as you like but

448
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,420
as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you come in the vicinity of</font>

449
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,790
any Wi-Fi access point I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

450
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,250
ebay k credential first and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

451
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:16,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">always use the realm identifier from</font>

452
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,200
3gpp<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network the Lord so we actually had</font>

453
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,880
customers in at your own who said I've

454
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,140
configured my mobile phone with the

455
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,360
right credentials I know my password is

456
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,130
correct but for some reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> it never</font>

457
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,719
actually authenticates and that is

458
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:30,140
because the routing of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> request</font>

459
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">always consistently failed luckily that</font>

460
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,430
manufacturer has moved to<font color="#CCCCCC"> android</font>

461
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:37,730
meanwhile so their own implementation is

462
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,260
gone but you know back in the day I<font color="#CCCCCC"> dry</font>

463
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,940
like I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could just approach</font>

464
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,220
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> electrons tell him look you're</font>

465
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,900
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wrong but it was never</font>

466
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,840
mentioned as explicitly as it could be

467
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,860
but this is not something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should do</font>

468
00:22:46,840 --> 00:23:04,639
so that's what they stalk you mind is

469
00:22:48,860 --> 00:23:07,780
trying to fix and this is you know in

470
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,010
another way is it is it will it be

471
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,700
simpler to say that it is assumed that

472
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:16,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the user name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the identity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used in the</font>

473
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,000
as a username will be relevant enough to

474
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,120
figure out which we are to address and

475
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,910
how how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that it's not so relevant</font>

476
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,969
for this document it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

477
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,290
Nick you can put rising simple text to

478
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,120
say that it is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take into</font>

479
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:35,930
account but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same issue with</font>

480
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,189
diameter anyway yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um the document</font>

481
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,700
already says it's up to local

482
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:42,440
configuration how to split the web<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ram</font>

483
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,480
identifier which is the equal sponsored

484
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,550
entity and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual user identifier</font>

485
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,280
which is whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> method uses as an</font>

486
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,720
identifier how you do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

487
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,230
ask the user I can't because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff</font>

488
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,480
yeah so actually from my personal point

489
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:05,280
of view not as a sherbet as individual I

490
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:06,990
think it's enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay shim shot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

491
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,730
I understand how to deal with issued to

492
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:12,780
you and I understand how to shoot<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

493
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:15,809
three in your next steps um having a bit

494
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:19,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">of problem with one you've described a</font>

495
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:23,428
problem and I will admit<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm tired so I</font>

496
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:28,530
may have dozed off and missed exactly

497
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:30,270
what the options are for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution so</font>

498
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:34,440
that we can converge on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution at</font>

499
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:37,110
this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of at this every</font>

500
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,530
time I hear this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like we have a</font>

501
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:42,600
problem it'd be nice and client

502
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:45,418
configuration could fix this to be nice

503
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,129
to find you I could fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but we</font>

504
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,860
really don't know what to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clients</font>

505
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:54,090
what to do on this so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

506
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:56,189
have a solution it's just kind of client

507
00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:00,178
devices should just keep trying things

508
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,650
until things become happy well it's not

509
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:05,460
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that needs fixing in</font>

510
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:08,280
you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UI's I know actually allow you</font>

511
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,260
with your method to select which I'll

512
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,590
true identity you use what we call realm

513
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">identify I mean what so the UI why's</font>

514
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,539
everything is fine the problem is much

515
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:21,330
more with the state machine and if you

516
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:24,390
have locally configured more than one

517
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:26,189
realm<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier well you have to</font>

518
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,590
restart<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new state machine after you</font>

519
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:31,620
failed with one credential and you just

520
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:34,559
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run one state machine for both eep</font>

521
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,989
types that's not enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have one if</font>

522
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,950
state machine for one eep type if it

523
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work and you want to try the</font>

524
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,669
other one start fresh start fresh with

525
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,429
the new realm identifier that matches

526
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:48,780
the other reap type and then use that so

527
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:50,789
it's pretty much yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end code in</font>

528
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,970
the supplicants it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to with you</font>

529
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:55,590
I or changing configs the only conflict

530
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,600
ends you might want to have is for

531
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,850
privacy considerations if you want to

532
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,939
manually order your<font color="#E5E5E5"> eep types and terms</font>

533
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:04,240
of preference then the shake machine as

534
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:08,370
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes along</font>

535
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,370
should honor that that's the only change

536
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:15,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brian wise Cisco I'm a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> confused</font>

537
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:18,820
on the privacy situation so first

538
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,860
comment is that graph says you know

539
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,220
identifiers will be revealed and then it

540
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:27,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">says when privacy is aching important</font>

541
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,140
and actually we're in an age where one

542
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:31,210
way developing protocols privacy is

543
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,740
always important so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a very</font>

544
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,020
good statement actually we should be

545
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,300
designing otherwise but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question</font>

546
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,870
is in this example for example that

547
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're showing will the client device</font>

548
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:45,010
try to use both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of his credentials all</font>

549
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,380
the time or just when he sees certain

550
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,910
pass points or other indicators from the

551
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,340
network you'll only use ones that match

552
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:53,230
which one is it yeah so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

553
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,699
situation way only tries a credential if

554
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,590
he knows it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on this</font>

555
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,809
particular criterion the other story I

556
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,230
told many years back was just ignorance

557
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:06,100
on these applicants he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> did that</font>

558
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">despite having new information I'm sorry</font>

559
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,250
it's couldn't quite it was injected<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

560
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly this is actually the</font>

561
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,420
situation the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eep type is only tried if</font>

562
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,120
a local context says it is good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

563
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,710
network yeah so that's not so bad i mean

564
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,090
least he's only responding when he's

565
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,650
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of indication of</font>

566
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,928
course the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> good or an attacker</font>

567
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:24,640
could lie about that but it's a little

568
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:27,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">better than for example when we cycle</font>

569
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,410
through all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSID our device but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

570
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,940

00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,090
privacy statement obviously staying a

572
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,500
little bit stronger in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> section and</font>

573
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:38,139
explaining maybe you know where there's

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,270
better protection or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean it does</font>

575
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,670
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the latest eep</font>

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,860
protect against an active attacker but

579
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,889
maybe you're protecting into passive

580
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:53,409
attacker then I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that</font>

581
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:56,350
should be may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be made more clear yes I'm</font>

582
00:27:53,410 --> 00:28:03,250
all for making the privacy statements or

583
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:05,709
rigid no<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so basically for many</font>

584
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:08,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">eep types which are in use today like</font>

585
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:11,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">ttls peep and so on these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> private sex</font>

586
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,689
engines do work we have some bleep labs

587
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:15,928
where they don't so a PWD on the

588
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dragonfly thing from from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that hearkens</font>

589
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:19,210
basically has no

590
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:22,480
possibility to hide the reuse identifier

591
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:23,980
so that's why the draft said rats s so

592
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:51,340
if you have these e types try those

593
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:52,690
lasts because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this</font>

594
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,510
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the two only</font>

595
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,250
drafts we have to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> actively as a</font>

596
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:01,000
working group at this point so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

597
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:06,480
the new work<font color="#E5E5E5"> um Jim chard for the RC</font>

598
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,480
6614 this document and TLS 1.3

599
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:22,760
so when I volunteered for this I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

600
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,220
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be easy no problems it always</font>

601
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,730
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> right um yeah I mean I I know exactly</font>

602
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:32,530
what needs to be done here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

603
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:35,299
going towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there's the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leg so</font>

604
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,100
then I of course reread the documents

605
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:41,090
with an eye towards actually editing

606
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:43,459
them and said oh well there's a couple

607
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:46,459
of issues that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly too sure</font>

608
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,260
how to progress and there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

609
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:52,370
issues where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too sure which</font>

610
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:54,169
documents to progress so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll cover</font>

611
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,969
these things we can give<font color="#E5E5E5"> some guidance</font>

612
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:58,549
we can figure out which documents we

613
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:00,140
actually want to to rev whether we want

614
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to combine some documents together while</font>

615
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,179
we're doing the revving and see what

616
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,720
happens so there's a couple of nice

617
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:11,390
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> top-level topics that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font>

618
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,049
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered how do you trust things what</font>

619
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:18,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">does your tickets look like um how do we</font>

620
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:20,809
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually say you should use</font>

621
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,010
tickets whether you must use ticket

622
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:24,950
support tickets there's some real

623
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:26,690
advantages in doing so there's some

624
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting questions about transport</font>

625
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:32,419
layers and how things work or don't work

626
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,370
in terms of who does things what things

627
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:36,650
do which transport layers we want to run

628
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,959
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's some some really</font>

629
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:41,929
fast TLS option questions that we may

630
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:47,450
want to think about documenting as we go

631
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:49,780
forward next so trust months basically

632
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,190
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust modes that are</font>

633
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,678
essentially laid out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current</font>

634
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,789
document the first is to say oh yeah

635
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:00,530
well using CA infrastructure they're

636
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:03,740
relatively cheap but they're kind of

637
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:05,480
hard depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> upon what sort of system</font>

638
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:08,480
you're setting up to get everybody to

639
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,309
buy in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same infrastructure is of</font>

640
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">course the pre-shared key which is</font>

641
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically how radius is instead of today</font>

642
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,200
you could continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that but of</font>

643
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,720
course that's you know manual

644
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,580
configuration and gets to you know a

645
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,090
real mess in terms of trying to

646
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:29,389
configure it going forward uh this upon

647
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:32,029
Billy of using Dane and maybe doing some

648
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:35,299
some lookups in terms of trying to

649
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:37,730
establish is just the right cert to be

650
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:41,750
used but that still doesn't actually

651
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:43,700
solve the problem of do I trust the

652
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:46,039
entity that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the subject of the syrup</font>

653
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,919
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like yeah this is a certificate</font>

654
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:52,669
that's associated with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know food on</font>

655
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:55,610
example for the domain but I still<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

656
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:59,090
to make a<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision is food on example a</font>

657
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:01,129
domain I'm willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to and is the</font>

658
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,959
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they give back going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

659
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,149
ace<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer i'm willing to actually</font>

660
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,610
use in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things like</font>

661
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:12,260
granting access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a network and things</font>

662
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:14,379
like that um I actually briefly thought

663
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:19,669
about the whole question of should we

664
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:24,020
include the DNS lookup stuff in terms of

665
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:27,440
was in 75 85 and personally I'd actually

666
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,480
just rather bury that in the sand and

667
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:35,000
let someone else deal with it then put

668
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:37,549
it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document so I mean if it</font>

669
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,270
obviously we need to document the first

670
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:43,340
two in terms of how to do things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

671
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how much we want a document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dane</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

672
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">not document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane in terms of</font>

673
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:50,179
establishing trust in certificates since

674
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,330
it doesn't actually really solve the

675
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:55,669
problem it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> merely kind of says yes</font>

676
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,049
you have a certificate that's real but

677
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:59,149
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't say anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about whether</font>

678
00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:07,730
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the entity at the other</font>

679
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:09,379
end<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next a certificate profile we</font>

680
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,840
should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually talk about with</font>

681
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,840
certificates what should be in a

682
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,449
certificate that is used for radius and

683
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:21,620
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is pretty simple we don't</font>

684
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently have one arm policy OS is</font>

685
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,360
certainly one way of establishing

686
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,120
whether or not you think they<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

687
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,549
particular trick of it is useful another

688
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,370
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extended key usages often the</font>

689
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:36,200
times used there's a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things we</font>

690
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:39,229
need to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

691
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,760
so what sort of naming do we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

692
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,040
insert if

693
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,100
it's do we put in DNS naming do we put

694
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:50,170
in IP naming do we put in something else

695
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:51,909
that is URL based or in realm based in

696
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:57,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">AI something or other which would just</font>

697
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:59,560
be kind of please no spare<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arm so</font>

698
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,170
most of that stuff I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas</font>

699
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,300
in terms of how to go forward in push so

700
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:10,179
so I'm not immediately too worried about

701
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:15,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things next oops sorry I should</font>

702
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:15,570
have talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that already ticket</font>

703
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:24,130
TLS 1.3 is making tickets and a whole

704
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:27,340
lot more useful I mean they exist in the

705
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:30,610
current systems but with 1.3 they just

706
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:32,260
become extremely useful so basically

707
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:37,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you can do is you can go through</font>

708
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:41,220
the full validation process now send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

709
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:43,750
certificate generate diffie-hellman keys

710
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:46,928
do your client verified be your

711
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,949
certificate verify and say oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font>

712
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:51,460
that I've sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the first message</font>

713
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:53,980
give me back a set of tickets what that

714
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,870
means is the second time you hook up you

715
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,060
say here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ticket from when you</font>

716
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:59,940
validated me last time and here's the

717
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:02,020
pre-shared key that we used on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

718
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,670
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to do anything about</font>

719
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending certificates around because we</font>

720
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">already know the answers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

721
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:11,920
questions so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're really</font>

722
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,799
reducing Rica next time or setting up a

723
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,530
second channel if we basically say yeah

724
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,680
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support tickets and that's</font>

725
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:22,690
potentially a huge win just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you</font>

726
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:30,220
save the cost on certificate validations

727
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:33,130
on both ends next so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically a</font>

728
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:36,220
real fast look at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the advantages</font>

729
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:39,940
you get with us 1.3 in terms of

730
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:42,430
handshakes um this is kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

731
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:47,700
scaled-back version of what things look

732
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:52,839
like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you do pre care to see</font>

733
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:54,430
pre-shared key that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

734
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:57,940
application can actually send encrypted

735
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:59,769
data along with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> message so this</font>

736
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:02,349
says that not only when I if I use

737
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:04,118
tickets and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you reconnect do I not have</font>

738
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:06,940
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through all the certificate stuff</font>

739
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:09,640
I'm actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send my request up</font>

740
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,559
on that first message whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

741
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:16,328
first set of a great whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> that first</font>

742
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:19,269
rate hike it is so I'm really reducing

743
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:21,819
the number of messages i'm sending

744
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:24,609
between the server and the client and

745
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:27,940
radius by doing this this pre shared

746
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:30,359
secret ticket resumption because i'm

747
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:33,880
sending that message up the first time

748
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:36,279
i'm still actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> saving things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

749
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,099
terms of if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference</font>

750
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:44,559
between 1.2 and one and 1.3 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS</font>

751
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:46,930
because in 1.3 even if you go through

752
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> full certificate validation you can</font>

753
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:54,669
send encrypted data up on your second

754
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:56,828
message whereas in 1.2 is basically it's

755
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,869
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third message that this client sends</font>

756
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:01,960
out that they can finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> send encrypted</font>

757
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:03,069
data so in any event you're saving one

758
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,440
round trip and you're potentially

759
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:08,019
basically not having any round trips on

760
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,960
your encrypted data with with with the

761
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:19,089
ticket resumption if you set up parallel

762

<font color="#CCCCCC">dls ports so next this is where I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that I immediately started running into</font>

805
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,490
problems as I read these documents was

806
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,960
trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out exactly what was</font>

807

supposed to happen as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you went between</font>

boundaries of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who was</font>

doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> recentiy was not doing reasons why</font>

810
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:01,910
were people who are doing reasons so the

811
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,850
the TCP document says hey this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

812
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:08,330
reliable transport you never do a recent

813
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:10,730
because it's reliable transport that

814
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:13,369
works great<font color="#E5E5E5"> right up until you say I'm</font>

815
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:19,010
doing TCP up to this proxy and from that

820
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,260
thinks is talking to reliable transport

the proxy is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it because</font>

822
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:36,890
proxies don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> recent so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is</font>

823
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:40,550
nobody does it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not a</font>

workable answer the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing the</font>

00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:45,620
other world would be even as spurs on

826
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:48,890
UDP and it goes to a proxy which

827
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,810
converts between UDP and<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP the man's</font>

828
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:54,080
is going to start potentially hammering

829
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:56,870
that that reliable<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP channel with</font>

830
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,060
retransmits because things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> timing</font>

831
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:01,819
that somewhere down the line maybe

832
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">because nobody wants to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

833
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,000
there's additional traffic on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

834
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,720
channel that doesn't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font>

835
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,160
there because well you got that far and

836
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,959
then somebody else's problem beyond that

837
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,790
who's reliable there's also some

838
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,900
interesting questions that they come up

839
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:23,690
in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the big message stuff that</font>

840
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:27,610
went through it may be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very nice if you</font>

841
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:29,990
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> from UDP to tcp and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP to UTB to</font>

842
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,810
reassemble those big messages so it's

843
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:37,129
basically you know unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you first UDP</font>

844
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">hop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can confirm back real fast get the</font>

845
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:42,740
entire message send the big message<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

846
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:44,840
my big TCP pipe which may actually end

847
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:48,109
up going straight to the server and save

848
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:51,110
a whole lot of round trips on the

849
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:56,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">server's half behalf so that's useful</font>

850
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:57,710
you're using our next this isn't all

851
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,520
that interesting there's a whole slew

852
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:06,110
possible set of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that be done um</font>

853
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:09,890
next also question is which documents

854
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:11,720
need to be done and revved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and am I</font>

855
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:13,640
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap all of them or some other</font>

856
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,250
people going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrote them at a minimum</font>

857
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,730
I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to biz that's easy p</font>

858
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:23,950
document or else wrap that into the TLS

859
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:25,660
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

860
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:40,480
Thanks maybe one quick question but

861
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:45,120
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit over x or no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

862
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one will be the laura1 draft</font>

863
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:05,800
Hyuna maroon I'm one of the author of

864
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:08,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">this draft and this is 0-1 version of</font>

865
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,710
the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we got some comments for</font>

866
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:15,339
the 00 version so the main motivation of

867
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:17,700
the draft is to include the existing to

868
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,170
play infrastructure into the laura1

869
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:24,490
infrastructure for authentication so

870
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:26,950
next slide so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laura1 a</font>

871
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:29,379
long-range wide area networks and we

872
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:38,290
have some impressive numbers it's taken

873
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:41,530
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LP 1 buff so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here we</font>

874
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:44,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the N do in device and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

875
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:47,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">mass our network server in this case and</font>

876
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:49,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> N device communicates to the network</font>

877
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:52,450
server through the radio gateway and

878
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:56,140
this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the picture from the</font>

879
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:58,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">buff but actually available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laura1</font>

880
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,490
specification doesn't have the joint

881
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,290
server so all the authentication is

882
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:05,740
taken place from the network server

883
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:07,960
point of view so and initially we have a

884
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,839
pre-shared key between the end device

885
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,760
and the network server and after the

886
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:16,210
joint procedure we have arrived at the

887
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">session Keys so which are used to</font>

888
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,380
decrypt and encrypt the communication

889
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,120
between the end device on the network or

890
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:27,660
the in device on the application server

891
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:30,549
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so our motivation is to</font>

892
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,750
replace this joint server which was

893
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:34,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually not in the current</font>

894
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:36,490
specification but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

895
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">play server and the network server</font>

896
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:40,870
communicates with the to play

897
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:44,440
server in with a radius protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font>

898
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:47,080
like so while to play wii I mean as you

899
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> battle-tested and it's</font>

900
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:52,110
deployed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wild since years example</font>

901
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:55,120
ready Eddie Rome and it's also scalable

902
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:57,870
it's suitable for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Internet of Things</font>

903
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:03,880
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Federation our suitable for</font>

904
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:06,339
roaming next so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I'm going to take</font>

905
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:09,010
you over the current procedure which is

906
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:11,590
used in the lower line so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

907
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,510
commissioning which means that app au

908
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,980
app key which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the pre-shared key</font>

909
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:18,220
between the end device on the network

910
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:20,650
server and also we have that DVD y which

911
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:25,120
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique to each of the device next</font>

912
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:27,700
slide so first the device sends a joint

913
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:31,420
request with some kind of unknowns along

914
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:34,270
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Debbie you I along</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the WI and</font>

915
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:36,120
a pu y to the network server and then it

916
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:40,150
talks hour after verifying the

917
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:42,670
credentials that means app app key so it

918
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,830
sends back<font color="#CCCCCC"> the joint request already</font>

919
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">joined except and this device can be</font>

920
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:50,890
able to derive the session<font color="#CCCCCC"> case later on</font>

921
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:52,720
next slides so this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

922
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:56,319
contents of the request and the response

923
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:00,730
the main fields to note note here is the

924
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:02,530
app eyw I unknowns a py is more specific

925
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,660
for the application provider and every

926
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:06,790
why is specific for each of the device

927
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,569
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nonce is created by the device</font>

928
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:13,140
itself and in the response apt nonce is

929
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:15,490
generated<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the network's server and</font>

930
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,799
net ID and the dev address are also

931
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:21,220
generated from the network server so

932
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:23,280
here the request is sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> without the</font>

933
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:26,560
encryption but attached with the mick

934
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,690
that is message integrity code and but

935
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,759
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> response is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always encrypted from</font>

936
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:33,670
the network server so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> n device can</font>

937
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:38,170
decrypt the response with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> help of</font>

938
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:41,110
the app app key so the app key makes the

939
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,730
message that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will show you check yes ok</font>

940
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:49,180
so we calculate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> musical sighnaghi</font>

941
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:51,100
yes so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the keys which are</font>

942
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in authentication part the up</font>

943
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,440
key

944
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:55,029
is a pre-shared between the device on

945
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,299
the network server and the network

946
00:46:55,029 --> 00:47:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">session key is used or is derived and</font>

947
00:46:58,299 --> 00:47:02,799
it's used to encrypt or decrypt the

948
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:04,450
commands or my commands between the

949
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:07,119
network network server and the in device

950
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:10,180
and the app session key is used for the

951
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:13,210
application specific data for now it's

952
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:18,220
what the keys are reside residing within

953
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:22,980
the network server so i can you cook

954
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:26,950
como slice<font color="#E5E5E5"> so our proposition would be</font>

955
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:29,740
to include the radius server which which

956
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:33,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in which actually does all the</font>

957
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:36,910
jobs of the network server and we

958
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:40,930
exchange the keys through the radius

959
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:45,220
attributes so and yeah so in this case

960
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:48,578
the network the app session key we have

961
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:50,379
put two stars which means you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can decide</font>

962
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:53,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">to send to back to the network server</font>

963
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,569
are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> reading and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can share it</font>

964
00:47:53,499 --> 00:48:00,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">with another application server server</font>

965
00:47:55,569 --> 00:48:04,930
through another interface Oh next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

966
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:08,980
so we plan to introduce three sorry this

967
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:13,440
for new attributes in the radius and we

968
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:16,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">considered the RFC 6 to 18 or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 6 14 for</font>

969
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:21,579
maintaining the security to transmit the

970
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:25,470
keys over the network next slide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

971
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:30,279
open issue is that we have this a pu I

972
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:33,399
from the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> n device and we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

973
00:48:30,279 --> 00:48:37,989
have some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a methodology to map</font>

974
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:40,569
it with the application owner so we need

975
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:44,799
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically when the network server or</font>

976
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:47,730
network access server gets this request

977
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:51,700
it has to check the realm of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

978
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:53,799
application owner and use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns a query</font>

979
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:57,480
or something like that to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the</font>

980
00:48:53,799 --> 00:49:01,029
appropriate radius server so one such

981
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,249
solution which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found was some 0 for 3</font>

982
00:49:01,029 --> 00:49:04,720
but we need to do the inverse of this

983
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:09,310
thing

984
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,959
to make this happen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next life I mean</font>

985
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:13,930
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to implement we implemented</font>

986
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:18,390
actually a proof of concept we run the

987
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:20,980
radius implementation in go language and

988
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:25,950
probably we are thinking of implementing

989
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:29,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the using the free radius for the Laura</font>

990
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:43,930
nice thanks for everyone for the

991
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:48,580
comments and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well then I have</font>

00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:01,029
looks like this and that's pretty much

997
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:04,060
structured data so we have motor

998
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:05,349
subfields in one radius attribute we

999
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,740
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually like how attributes that</font>

1000
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:10,690
way we can also decide each each of

1001
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,919
these parameters<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> radius</font>

1002
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:15,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">attribute that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm getting at</font>

1003
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:20,290
there yes and no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe</font>

1004
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:24,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">its 6158 that says where there are data</font>

1005
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:28,779
structures pre-existing elsewhere and

1006
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:32,050
transported by radius unmodified you can

1007
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:34,119
just transport them as is the thing is

1008
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:36,520
basically the register bandits to tears

1009
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:38,320
apart to do all the key calculations so

1010
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:41,680
it needs some kind of a business logic

1011
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:44,859
here the reason why we like to send

1012
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,330
without modifying anything is that at

1013
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:48,190
this point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the network access</font>

1014
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:52,089
server doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1015
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:58,550
app key so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the mick calculated</font>

1016
00:50:52,089 --> 00:51:01,009
based on the up key yeah but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1017
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:04,880
protection using radios<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shetty's or</font>

1018
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:07,460
whatever use so don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

1019
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,290
be an issue anyway for example the

1020
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:12,110
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I that's basically MAC</font>

1021
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,550
address if I got that right we usually

1022
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:18,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">call this calling station ID and the</font>

1023
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:20,570
attribute exists already so yes yes or

1024
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">no I mean my two cents is an implementer</font>

1025
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:25,160
in some respects<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be easy if this</font>

1026
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:27,830
easier for this was all just radius

1027
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:30,319
attributes on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do have a</font>

1028
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:32,840
low thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for re-implementing things</font>

1029
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,060
multiple times if there's some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1030
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,400
library which already does all of this

1031
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:41,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just link to it and pass it a</font>

1032
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:44,000
blob then I'm happy right and it's it's

1033
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:48,470
much easier the more complicated issue

1034
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:51,650
is what policies do people want based on

1035
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:54,919
this so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are going to say if</font>

1036
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:57,590
the net ID is this then respond with a

1037
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,380
different radius thing or if this other

1038
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:04,100
lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Enfield is that then do it</font>

1039
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:06,410
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else then it would be more</font>

1040
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:09,620
useful to split them out into radius

1041
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:13,129
attributes and at this point just use TL

1042
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:15,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">v's because it works so it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of</font>

1043
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:18,380
what the use case is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your Express if</font>

1044
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:21,500
you expect this to be transported<font color="#E5E5E5"> as is</font>

1045
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:24,860
and not really examined by anyone other

1046
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:27,380
than a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of crypto dedicated to</font>

1047
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:29,600
this protocol it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to</font>

1048
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:32,360
transport it as is if the radius server

1049
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:43,029
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things based on the contents</font>

1050
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:48,680
you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to break it out so</font>

1051
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:53,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah as a chair ne ne ne so we're not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">responsible for defining the functional</font>

1053
00:52:53,990 --> 00:53:00,439
solution so from from the lower point of

1054
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:03,380
view is there any expectation to have

1055
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:08,330
such kind of a solution based on radius

1056
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:09,800
or it is a you are you are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1061
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:29,380

00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:31,808
here in this working group usually in

00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,339
this in this working group right now so

1064
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:35,440
we are we're responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

1065
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:38,109
definition of the protocol but not how

1066
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,910
this protocol is used by others so it

1067
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:42,730
could be other working group inside the

1068
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:44,828
ATF are in a service do so actually we

1069
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:46,720
will work on this on the actor if there

1070
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:48,250
is an existing requirements so i was

1071
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,109
wondering what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current</font>

1072
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:55,599
expectation from the lower community on

1073
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:59,290
that right now actually we have not that

1074
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:04,900
from the lp one group at maybe down the

1075

1077
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:12,099
agree with only one attribute there will

<font color="#CCCCCC">be an implementation that processes the</font>

00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,829
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that say that it was a good</font>

1083
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:29,319
idea to implement this kind of things

1084
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:31,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think that the most</font>

requirements from this community to be

00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:42,460
able to develop that whatever I think

1090
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:45,299
that from a technical point of view we

1091
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:47,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">can discuss and especially the link</font>

1092
00:54:45,299 --> 00:54:49,660
between what's come from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alara and</font>

1093
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,520
what you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> export to a radio</font>

1094
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,098
server but i think that from from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1095
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,170
protocol it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward we</font>

1096
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:59,079
just need to to agree on the set of

attributes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i may have some concern about</font>

1098
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:04,150
that and the way the attributes are

1099
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:06,910
defined but the most important part is

1100
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:09,369
to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reserve the</font>

and and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what would be at least</font>

1105
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:23,500
we tried from a problem statement point

1106
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:25,600
of view it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to consider the</font>

1107
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,460
different cases yet that you may have

00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,299
regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the location of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> triple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1112
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:42,520
there were some discussion about roaming

1113
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,830
for instance but I don't really know

1114
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,240
what's what is the the current

1115
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:48,160
requirements regarding is<font color="#E5E5E5"> rooming so I</font>

1116
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:55,479
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of stuff could</font>

1117
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:58,690
first of all good first of all militates

1118
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:01,780
or I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is English</font>

1119
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:03,490
but actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a promote the use of a</font>

1120
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:06,850
triple a beta a triple a basic

1121
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:13,450
infrastructure and obviously 24<font color="#CCCCCC"> red you</font>

1122
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:15,640
server in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so one quick</font>

1123
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:18,250
question for me is this is the lack of

1124
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,430
radius attributes and the lack of an RFC

1125
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:23,500
here holding back lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> wall in any way</font>

1126
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:25,270
so is this urgent work that doesn't

1127
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,010
allow you to continue it would be great

1128
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:30,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these the various attributes</font>

1129
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:32,320
defined elderly yeah but when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font>

1130
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:34,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier that the triple-a part doesn't</font>

1131
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:37,840
really exist and right now the keys are

1132
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:39,910
validated run<font color="#E5E5E5"> right don't usually they</font>

1133
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:42,850
do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the network access</font>

1134
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:45,580
server itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the standard as</font>

1135
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:48,069
such is working already you just said

1136
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:52,680
they have discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the using</font>

1137
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:55,150
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason tunnel to communicate with</font>

1138
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:57,160
join server or something like that yeah

1139
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:59,860
actually see if I understood correctly

1140
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,810
the joint server doesn't exist as of now

1141
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:03,970
in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of specification available to</font>

1142
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:05,860
the public they don't have the entity

1143
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:08,410
called joints<font color="#E5E5E5"> our ok so now they want to</font>

1144
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:13,170
decorate both type of server and and

1145
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:18,149
it's where there is a discussion yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1146
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:18,150
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move on ok thank you</font>

1147
00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:24,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so for the next one there are no</font>

1148
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:26,589
slides out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's somebody here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

1152
00:57:37,479 --> 00:57:42,759

1153
00:57:39,549 --> 00:57:44,739
of the drug dealer since then and all

1154
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:47,019
what I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the content is</font>

1155
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:48,160
stable it<font color="#CCCCCC"> adairs to the recommendation</font>

1156
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:51,939
from this working group and it's

1157
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,919
fulfilled on the data type guidelines

1158
00:57:51,939 --> 00:57:56,799
and so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a request to</font>

1159
00:57:53,919 --> 00:58:04,118
consider this as a new shelter item of

1160
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:07,779
this working group yeah my question back

1161
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:10,449
then was so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually being used is</font>

1162
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:13,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">it useful because the use case didn't</font>

1163
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:18,069
repair convincing but is it part of any

1164
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:20,799
standard it depends what we what we call

1165
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:22,449
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the sundial in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

1166
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">exists with but it is not as wonder</font>

1167
00:58:22,449 --> 00:58:26,319
about is an experimental track which is

1168
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:28,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">in ptc psf which the the protocol that</font>

1169
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:30,959
defines the communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the</font>

1170
00:58:28,299 --> 00:58:33,209
two and that that support in participe

00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:36,519
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you skillet we are targeting is</font>

1172
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:38,788
involves the cpe and another element

which<font color="#E5E5E5"> located in the network which is an</font>

another NP disappear and proxy which is

1175
00:58:41,409 --> 00:58:45,519
located in the concentrator and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1176
00:58:43,509 --> 00:58:47,319
two entities are not songs are so far as

1177
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:50,499
you know here in ATF it is difficult to

1178
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:51,699
so not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP proxy staff even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for TCP</font>

1179
00:58:50,499 --> 00:58:53,859
existing networks but there is nothing

1180
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:55,599
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is on the rise</font>

1181
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:58,808
so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some magic there which is</font>

1182
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:01,299
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> MPD CP proxies will glue multiple</font>

1183
00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:03,579

00:59:01,299 --> 00:59:05,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the wireless network and the other</font>

1185
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:06,699
one that we've come from the wire land

1186
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:08,709
and then it will glue this multiple

1187
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:09,999
paths in order to increase the bandwidth

1188
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:12,249
which is exposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cast and red</font>

1189
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:15,129
cell so the purpose dirty is to increase

1190
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:16,928
the quality of experience of the

1191
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:20,859
customers and also for the service

1192
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:22,719
provider to optimize them because there

1193
00:59:20,859 --> 00:59:25,900
are some lines than access plans which

1194
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:29,319
are all increasing this one to support

1195
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:31,640
the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> topologies is really capex and</font>

1196
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:34,640
opex consuming and there is a

1197
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:38,150
a real trend today in the greater

1198
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:40,250

01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,880
interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that on the mailing list I</font>

1230
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:55,640
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the basic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question from</font>

1231
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,860
from Stefan things that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

1232
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:00,230
from Zoe as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the previous</font>

1233
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,580
document from a protocol point of view

1234
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:05,090
it's fine and actually you are following

1235
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:06,920
the last recommendation so I I think

1236
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:08,990
it's more about interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> about about</font>

1237
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:12,650
this and if you at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least if there is</font>

1238
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:14,029
some people interested by maybe even if

1239
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:15,530
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not used to but saying that</font>

1240
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:19,090
there is an existing requirement for

1241
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:21,380
such kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of solution for authentication</font>

1242
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:23,300
particularly that don't figure to two

1243
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,160
questions and the first ones you

1244
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,420
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> participating fighting</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I can invite people but I won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

1249
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,649
because this is the purpose why aren't

1250
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:39,410
coming here because there is expertise

1251
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:43,010
about the radius extension so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1252
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:44,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's for me the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> core point is to two</font>

1253
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:47,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">12-volt defines something which</font>

01:01:44,859 --> 01:01:49,058
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely this aligned what</font>

1255
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:53,499
you want to see in in erotic

01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:55,029
specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be hard to</font>

1257
01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:56,618
convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community in the radix</font>

01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:59,319
working group that impede<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecp is good</font>

1259
01:01:56,619 --> 01:02:01,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good if I have that but</font>

1260
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:03,940
I am NOT happy to see that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want</font>

1261
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:09,788
i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight to to see that because</font>

1262
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:11,859
there is no point there to do that this

1263
01:02:09,789 --> 01:02:14,799
is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> elegant I mean my two cents</font>

1264
01:02:11,859 --> 01:02:16,989
is the the purpose of radix is not just

1265
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:20,109
to extend radius but also to review and

1266
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:22,869
accept and authorize other people's use

1267
01:02:20,109 --> 01:02:25,690
of radius and for one attribute that's

1268
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:29,470
the use case is clear I'm you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1269
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:32,289
happy with it it's it's partly true

1270
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:34,209
because it's always possible to define

1271
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:36,730
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance under specific AV pieces</font>

1272
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:40,420
the question is that when when even if

1273
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:42,730
we have a lot of room now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the from from</font>

1274
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:45,489
a working group point of view you need

1275
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:48,430
to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's 21 swear to request</font>

1276
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:50,920
but not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to someone but to two</font>

1277
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:53,649
people that will implement this yeah so

1278
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,569
in it was not something against you

1279
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:57,309
actually my colleague it was more about

1280
01:02:55,569 --> 01:02:59,499
to answer to this defender come and

1281
01:02:57,309 --> 01:03:02,799
saying that just to ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

1282
01:02:59,499 --> 01:03:05,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing something that actually even may</font>

1283
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:08,950
be used but I key that may be useful for

1284
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:12,369
forces yeah related question is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1285
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:13,868
rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> NP TCP is experimental why not</font>

1286
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:16,239
publish this is experimental I'm it

1287
01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:18,910
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily require a working</font>

1288
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:20,829
group draft it can just be published

1289
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:24,190
with radix group going yet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes</font>

1290
01:03:20,829 --> 01:03:26,319
sense yeah and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1291
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:30,220
able to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a as a</font>

1292
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:32,349
way forward for these documents so sorry

1293
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:36,368
we are we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> light we will not skip the</font>

1294
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:40,509
other one we just to say that we will so

1295
01:03:36,369 --> 01:03:41,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'd be late so the next one maybe we</font>

1296
01:03:40,509 --> 01:03:44,849
can try to shorter maybe the

1297
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:46,979
presentation but

1298
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:58,759
and between at just time for some

1299
01:03:46,979 --> 01:04:02,879
comments so please<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Ronnie yeah a and 0</font>

1300
01:03:58,759 --> 01:04:04,739
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm anchor chain from cisco</font>

1301
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,529
systems this is a joint work with my

1302
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:10,650
colleague lay machine from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco so this</font>

1303
01:04:07,529 --> 01:04:13,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a okay I'm we are trying to finish</font>

1304
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:16,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

1305
01:04:13,739 --> 01:04:19,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">statement I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where no into</font>

1306
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to folks in this room and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1307
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:23,819
the working group so this is body why

1308
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:28,710
add 1 by to identify field which

1309
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:31,499
basically allows only 256 requests in

1310
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:34,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">flux you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that right so the work</font>

1311
01:04:31,499 --> 01:04:38,578
around and basically document you might

1312
01:04:34,229 --> 01:04:40,259
put multiple IVs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to to do the</font>

1313
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,509
work run basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you create the pyro</font>

1314
01:04:40,259 --> 01:04:44,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">no station uses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you using the multiple</font>

1315
01:04:42,509 --> 01:04:48,859
source port in case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp of course</font>

1316
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:52,499
it's a true parallel notation X please

1317
01:04:48,859 --> 01:04:55,799
so the issue we are facing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1318
01:04:52,499 --> 01:04:57,959
vendor actually as a reference so a

1319
01:04:55,799 --> 01:05:00,719
suspect that the problem is not unique

1320
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,460
so currently we have actually deployment

1321
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:06,509
we have an implementation and he pointed

1322
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:08,999
at used to hundreds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> UT positions in</font>

1323
01:05:06,509 --> 01:05:11,940
the indicates<font color="#CCCCCC"> a wireless wireless LAN</font>

1324
01:05:08,999 --> 01:05:14,788
controller but it's the rental<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hendricks</font>

1325
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:17,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">and for the next generation product the</font>

1326
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:22,589
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically increase increase</font>

1327
01:05:17,549 --> 01:05:24,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">this performance by 10 X ok you can</font>

1328
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:26,910
imagine now it goes two sovereigns of

1329
01:05:24,779 --> 01:05:30,180
sessions that's case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think very</font>

1330
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:33,149
difficult it's just so this so this is a

1331
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:35,848
problem that I mean the ones a scale

1332
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:37,680
goes to surveillance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions</font>

1333
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:39,869
basically you have you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font>

1334
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,719
issues right you have a resource

1335
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:45,359
utilization a memory you have cpu you

1336
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:48,059
have the local port local bodies limited

1337
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:50,249
right and you have efficiency issues and

1338
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:53,819
you get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it puts a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1339
01:05:50,249 --> 01:05:55,488
load on your own or you're basically on

1340
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:58,170
the client as words on the summer

1341
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:58,570
harmonization can summer support if

1342
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:02,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font>

1343
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:04,720
wine a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client actually connects generate</font>

1344
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:07,600
thousands of station right the

1345
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:10,470
operational this implementation at the

1346
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:14,049
operational complexity next page please

1347
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:16,660
so here we basically we look at this

1348
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:18,820
which is basically it seems there's

1349
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:22,480
opportunity really for us to actually

1350
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:26,080
address this it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

1351
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,480
really am<font color="#CCCCCC"> new to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to this radius</font>

1352
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:31,330
working group I have construed an upper

1353
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,820
document looks like this the issue has

1354
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:36,370
been postponed but VI I believe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1355
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:38,530
a time that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are at points and these</font>

1356
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:40,600
need to be addressed in the protocol

1357
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:42,880
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing work run so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1358
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:46,420
that's what it is extension is about

1359
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,760
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we we propose a extended</font>

1360
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:50,980
packet header but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enlarge</font>

1361
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:54,160
the identifier field while we are doing

1362
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:56,650
that we also it looks like reasonable to

1363
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:59,319
also a large the code field ecotype

1364
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:02,050
because that is that is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-bite I</font>

1365
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,690
think we currently use about<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty-fifty</font>

1366
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:06,760
son so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a quarter then we will</font>

1367
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:09,580
basically to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> future proof let's do</font>

1368
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:14,290
the Cabbage advice and be done with it

1369
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:17,950
right so there's a then the way to hear

1370
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:20,980
the key for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know proposal is to</font>

1371
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:23,379
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> reserved to allocate a packet</font>

1372
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,060
we cope<font color="#E5E5E5"> I are thinking in this</font>

1373
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:29,950
group because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really become message</font>

1374
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:33,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">type here we call package type code and</font>

1375
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:37,240
so as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrier to in pain to actual the</font>

1376
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:39,759
real you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know packet inside then we use</font>

1377
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:43,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">a capability basically to discover their</font>

1378
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:45,370
way that is the server is supporting it

1379
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:48,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">so suppose is functionally next one</font>

1380
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:50,200
please right<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the this is the</font>

1381
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:52,720
extremely package a that we are

1382
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:55,569
proposing so the first if you look at a

1383
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:58,799
in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current standard here we</font>

1384
01:07:55,570 --> 01:08:01,840
have the the first batch is that it's a

1385
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:04,180
package code so we had to be used the

1386
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:06,730
allocated my special<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and the next</font>

1387
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:08,470
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> we is a reserve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> field the ninth is</font>

1388
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:10,690
the same authentication is the same

1389
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:12,819
become another<font color="#E5E5E5"> reserved view that in the</font>

1390
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:15,370
code if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at code is shifted</font>

1391
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:18,010
it's like a two bites named<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify</font>

1392
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:20,410
four bytes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the somatic should be made</font>

1393
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:22,210
the same so these the why we have this

1394
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:25,620
resolved field it's basically the

1395
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:30,819
concise the bias is for the existing

1396
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:34,620
protocol analyzers right if we with this

1397
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:38,830
format we can at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass it and</font>

1398
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:41,410
syntactical right yeah that's a bit if

1399
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:43,359
if the if you focusing is working group

1400
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:45,880
view that is not necessary of course

1401
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,830
then we can reduce it right that we

1402
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:51,160
don't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that leaves the ID other two</font>

1403
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:54,519
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scotty certainly we got a can be</font>

1404
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:57,240
reduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right makes my face so the</font>

1405
01:08:54,520 --> 01:09:03,220
how would this work basically you use

1406
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:06,819
you the client initiated this stutters

1407
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:09,190
stutters server<font color="#E5E5E5"> message right with a new</font>

1408
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:11,769
attribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> you basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font>

1409
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:14,620
discovery of capability on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

1410
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:18,760
pretty standard looks like right another

1411
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:20,559
way o.o if you know that's a source it

1412
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is something that so much support spike</font>

1413
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,089
on you got to bike configuration right

1414
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:28,960
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> once the capability is</font>

1415
01:09:25,089 --> 01:09:32,109
discovered always is no universe right

1416
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:34,510
you here<font color="#E5E5E5"> interim implementation so we</font>

1417
01:09:32,109 --> 01:09:38,339
recommend in the draft attached we

1418
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:41,230
reserve the existing 0 to 255 the

1419
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:44,200
numbers face and for the standard head

1420
01:09:41,229 --> 01:09:46,689
because if I discover or whatever right

1421
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:50,279
and is it for the upper for the larger

1422
01:09:46,689 --> 01:09:52,950
numbers you use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I</font>

1423
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:55,599
identified fill for the extent of it

1424
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:57,130
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> buzzer is this cover you can now</font>

1425
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,040
you can basically each year to the

1426
01:09:57,130 --> 01:10:04,300
packaging imposed for match in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1427
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:09,700
standard header or extended head I think

1428
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:11,950
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you because this so</font>

1429
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:14,139
whatever we like to do exist we want to

1430
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:16,450
solicited feedback from this working

1431
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:19,060
group and the respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address our</font>

1432
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:21,280
concerns and also basically 2k some

01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:22,890
operational implementation fear

1434
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:25,360
certainly from the cisco iOS

1435
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:26,469
implementation and also with the open

1436
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,049

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted at that good could I first</font>

1444
01:10:46,929 --> 01:10:50,650
make note that with my chair<font color="#CCCCCC"> head on so</font>

1445
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:53,499
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a substantial</font>

1446
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:56,079
modification to the protocol um we had a

1447
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:58,030
similar one just last week basically

1448
01:10:56,079 --> 01:11:00,969
which is the a larger packets for radius

1449
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:03,340
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp but that was experimental it</font>

1450
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:05,320
was over a new transport anyway so these

1451
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:08,260
were all fresh implementations what you

1452
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:10,268
have here<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically requires all of the</font>

1453
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:12,130
industry to update all their their

1454
01:11:10,269 --> 01:11:17,050
equipment and that's a whole different

1455
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:19,809
story so here he is yeah actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read</font>

1456
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:21,940
the number of drafts I also we have you

1457
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:24,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking we saw the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of this it</font>

1458
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:27,728
looks like actually the church is

1459
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:31,659
although conceptually yeah it is a

1460
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:34,780
fundamental<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree but the church is in</font>

1461
01:11:31,659 --> 01:11:37,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">really limit to the header the encoding</font>

1462
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:40,989
and decoding so my I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some</font>

1463
01:11:37,449 --> 01:11:42,489
other some code<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's look at my sense at</font>

1464
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:44,678
this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably a few hundred</font>

1465
01:11:42,489 --> 01:11:47,860
lines of code Shh because it's really

1466
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:53,229
limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in the infection of encoding</font>

1467
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:54,728
at you Cody yeah living so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't</font>

1468
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:57,849
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't have a concrete data</font>

1469
01:11:54,729 --> 01:12:00,909
but that's just my sense yeah so this is

1470
01:11:57,849 --> 01:12:04,900
Alan um yeah something like this has

1471
01:12:00,909 --> 01:12:07,839
been needed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years doing it is a</font>

1472
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:09,098
whole other nightmare as a point of

1473
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,039
information there is at least one

1474
01:12:09,099 --> 01:12:17,199
commercial radius server which extends

1475
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:20,559
the identifier space via of VSA they

1476
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:22,659
simply put a VSA into every packet and

1477
01:12:20,559 --> 01:12:25,300
the client and the server have a

1478
01:12:22,659 --> 01:12:28,329
configuration flag saying allow this

1479
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:30,190
vsause this VSA there's no negotiation

1480
01:12:28,329 --> 01:12:34,499
no nothing it's a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

1481
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:38,079
compatible with existing radius that

1482
01:12:34,499 --> 01:12:40,090
might be simpler and and would work

1483
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:43,480
without changing anything

1484
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:44,530
this changing the header if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1485
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">to throw out the header</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might as</font>

1486
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">well throw everything out and start over</font>

1487
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:51,009
from scratch which sounds sounds

1488
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:53,559
familiar i think we did that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i but</font>

1489
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:55,780
they seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have with the radius</font>

1490
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:58,120
product we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these discs our mattress</font>

1491
01:12:55,780 --> 01:13:01,290
that'll be that seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a nice way</font>

1492
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:04,240
to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the backward compatibility</font>

1493
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:06,550
to be technical the status server isn't

1494
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:09,969
really about discovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been abused</font>

1495
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:11,950
to be discovery we have had capability

1496
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:14,320
negotiations and radius going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

1497
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:16,030
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and everyone has run away</font>

1498
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,639
from them because they're different lady

1499
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:24,429
is why that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reputed its capability</font>

1500

as a individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's a perfect</font>

1502
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:34,900
use case for diameter which saying if

error if you can rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font>

1505
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:42,670
investigate any any any solution for

1506
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,920
that but if you can rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tribute</font>

1507
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:47,410
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if the real goal</font>

1508
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:54,520
is to enable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add will keep more than</font>

1509
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:57,070
250 556 concurrent operations it's the

1510
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:59,200
it's it's because you have a clean it or

1511
01:13:57,070 --> 01:14:04,389
something more and more in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case is</font>

1512
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:06,580
diameter it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think you'd see</font>

1513
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:10,150
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to take care about how to</font>

1514
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:14,260
extend and so on and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as set</font>

1515
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:17,730
by us define if the consequence even if

1516
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:21,100
it is simple from your point of view to

1517
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:23,230
update the other the error n to modify

1518
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:25,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> also client and the servers to be</font>

1519
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:27,730
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support that it's a huge impact</font>

1520
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:30,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on all the existing</font>

1521
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:32,290
implementation and actually what we are

1522
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:35,320
trying to do in this protocol is to

1523
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:37,990
extend the protocol functionalities but

1524
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:41,769
iranian something that anyone can decide

1525
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:44,670
to support or to ignore yeah but is this

1526
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:47,620
really i stand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle this really</font>

1527
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:50,650
does not a violent that pretty simple

1528
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:53,920
right so it's basically negotiation

1529
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:56,710
basis based yeah

1530
01:14:53,920 --> 01:15:01,870
right so here it is just a very very

1531
01:14:56,710 --> 01:15:03,670
practical a challenge we have today I've

1532
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:05,410
advocate with that the data point you

1533
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,990
know implemented we have hundreds now we

1534
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:11,110
are going to south I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just</font>

1535
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:13,630
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just I mean to people who</font>

1536
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:16,240
have not been associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the radius</font>

1537
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:17,830
who have not work it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the</font>

1538
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:20,889
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we talked about this sound</font>

1539
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:23,920
really silly then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we have a</font>

1540
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">history right so it's just as Ireland</font>

1541
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this new year with the</font>

1542
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:29,590
problem just one small additional

1543
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,970
comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after that I will let</font>

1544
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:34,000
the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we will flow the meeting</font>

1545
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:35,650
but the point is that for so for

1546
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">instance for diameter it is said that it</font>

1547
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:42,580
is used in mobile network and join it's

1548
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:44,920
fine it's it's it's expensive and so on

1549
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:47,500
and and the fact is that everything

1550
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,270
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce as it is today is fine</font>

1551
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,700
for the current deployment and even

1552
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:53,350
future<font color="#E5E5E5"> functionalities now if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we think</font>

1553
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,120
that the protocol is not so fine and we

1554
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:57,940
need also to modify the protocol itself

1555
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:59,950
not only at a adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> attribute to be</font>

1556
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:02,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind that is a key</font>

1557
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:04,690
issue for you as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see a thing I think</font>

1558
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:07,860
it's oh it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always time to think about</font>

1559
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:09,940
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to redefine also how the triple-a</font>

1560
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:18,839
infrastructure using such kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

1561
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:25,900
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's all appreciate ya</font>

1562
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:28,420
my name is my mission from Cisco so so I

1563
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:31,330
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so-called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1564
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:33,600
fundamental change is still if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

1565
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:38,590
support it you don't support it right

1566
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:41,530
from our a company point of view if we

1567
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:45,820
have such a use case and we also have

1568
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:48,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the suicide of the supports and it's</font>

1569
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:52,389
nice to do although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree to go to</font>

1570
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:55,210
things like a diameter is a simpler but

1571
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:59,620
this is a protocol needs to move forward

1572
01:16:55,210 --> 01:17:02,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">right ah if we keep delaying this thing</font>

1573
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:06,340
this issue is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real issue are navigate</font>

1574
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:10,090
the soft right so if you

1575
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:13,929
as another at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference so for folks</font>

1576
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:17,849
who actually who do know me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have been</font>

1577
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:21,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved in the routing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol area</font>

1578
01:17:17,849 --> 01:17:23,889
for a number years so weary tradition I

1579
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:26,650
don't know do you guys pay attention we

1580
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:29,260
transition the global internet from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25</font>

1581
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">years into four bodies in DDP that is</font>

1582
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:33,670
the sole fundamental right but buddy

1583
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:36,159
what's done is done really nicely now

1584
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:38,230
the tradition where you were you paid

1585
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:40,210
piece by piece spaces and the backward

1586
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:43,388
compatible and the whole world has

1587
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:46,619
tradition this this shall be some

1588
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:50,920
fundamental but it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me is really</font>

1589
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:52,989
the big here in st.<font color="#CCCCCC"> so full of of the</font>

1590
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:56,110
concept atacan concept from they were

1591
01:17:52,989 --> 01:17:58,690
not to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself my feeling is that as</font>

1592
01:17:56,110 --> 01:18:02,199
a as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> product designer and also at the</font>

1593
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:04,119
at the coder my sense is that this this

1594
01:18:02,199 --> 01:18:06,969
is really a few hundred lines cultures

1595
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:08,949
are we get more tea than later next one

1596
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:11,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah so I'm trying to find some</font>

1597
01:18:08,949 --> 01:18:12,848
nice closing words but so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1598
01:18:11,349 --> 01:18:14,920
honor I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what agree that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1599
01:18:12,849 --> 01:18:17,020
problem worth solving and it's hitting

1600
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:19,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the streets so that's no doubt about</font>

1601
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:21,340
that now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a solution here which</font>

1602
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:24,070
is a bit more heavy weight than what I

1603
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:26,159
told us about with the VSA and I think

1604
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:29,590
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> all go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> home</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and think about</font>

1605
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:32,170
how do we best solve this problem is it

1606
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:33,849
sufficient to well not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be as I</font>

1607
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">but standardized an attribute for the</font>

1608
01:18:33,849 --> 01:18:38,560
extended header or something extended

1609
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:42,849
identifier or you do do this rather big

1610
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:44,650
change um so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> our options are do</font>

1611
01:18:42,849 --> 01:18:46,150
we apply the<font color="#E5E5E5"> band-aid on one place or</font>

1612
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:48,638
another and is it a small piece of n

1613
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:52,509
tight or a big piece of band-aid the

1614
01:18:48,639 --> 01:18:53,949
truth is radius is pretty much as its

1615
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:57,580
limits here and we can't do without

1616
01:18:53,949 --> 01:19:01,388
band-aid so we have to less than perfect

1617
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:09,099
options on the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think and yeah we</font>

1618
01:19:01,389 --> 01:19:10,570
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make up our minds yeah please do</font>

1619
01:19:09,099 --> 01:19:12,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1620
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:26,530
so thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> staying longer than we</font>

1621
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:28,119
allocated anyway and for next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1622
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:32,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">will try to allocate 90 minutes because</font>

1623
01:19:28,119 --> 01:19:35,159
actually we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty to talk about so</font>

1624
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,159
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming goodbye</font>
