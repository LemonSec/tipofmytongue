milestones okay um well there's just

94
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,659
just a brief note about the seller

95
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:47,290
origin story about how the working group

96
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:50,140
was formed in late 2015 myself and tumor

97
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,360
the chairs you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter at</font>

98
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the you are all there and the mission</font>

99
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">statement is using existing work done by</font>

100
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,740
the development communities of matroska

101
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:01,959
ffv one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> flac the working group will</font>

102
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,640
formalize specifications for these open

103
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:09,399
and lossless formats and so these are

104
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,470
our current milestones these were

105
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,600
created when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group was first</font>

106
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:17,440
formed and some of them were updated

107
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,579
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> past spring what needs to be</font>

108
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,940
discussed i think is whether the dates

109
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:29,890
for these milestones need to be adjusted

110
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:32,170
in light of the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

111
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:36,760
done on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the on the current drafts</font>

112
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:40,649
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been submitted that's so i</font>

113
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,649
guess i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> open that up for discussion</font>

114
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,970
considering that that the dates on two

115
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those milestones have already passed</font>

116
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,750
yeah this is ben and i was going to say

117
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly that that the mouse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font>

118
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,890
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adjusted the</font>

119
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,890
ones that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> July</font>

120
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:12,639
all right well um just just to give my

121
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:14,499
personal opinion I think the the draft

122
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,540
for ebay ml is probably going to require

123
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:19,329
at least several months more<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and</font>

124
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">considering that that blocks the drafts</font>

125
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:25,599
for matroska which is much much larger

126
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:33,160
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that even the July deadline</font>

127
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:35,199
is is going to be unrealistic and this

128
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,339
has been again a clarification question

129
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:42,309
short de RAF that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now are</font>

130
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,720
for the one two and three milestone not

131
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,509
the version for milestone is that

132
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,540
correct um so I think the draft that was

133
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:58,360
submitted<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a standards track if I</font>

134
00:10:49,540 --> 00:11:00,429
remember go pull it up here yeah so so

135
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,689
the the individual draft that was

136
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:03,279
submitted<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently says that it is</font>

137
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:06,279
standards track which would seem to

138
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,429
indicate it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the milestone for</font>

139
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,009
version 4 um it also specifies the

140
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:15,249
elements for all the versions one two

141
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:16,899
and three um but our milestone for that

142
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:19,059
is informational which means that would

143
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,769
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in a separate document so I I</font>

144
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:22,839
don't currently think the individual

145
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,309
draft that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> submitted directly</font>

146
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,220
targets either of these two milestones

147
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:29,469
without some adjustments so we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

148
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:34,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how that works okay thank</font>

149
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you hi this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is David Rice I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to</font>

150
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:41,110
speak about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the workload in</font>

151
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,230
the habits that we're using versus the

152
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:48,610
informational and standard submission I

153
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:51,100
the I mean for IETF in matroska the

154
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,019
documentation is has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been historically</font>

155
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,839
developed on within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the matroska</font>

156
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:57,669
community and integrates all of the

157
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,439
versions together with<font color="#CCCCCC"> flags and</font>

158
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:03,309
identify errs to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> refer to what</font>

159
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:07,118
version they relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so we've been</font>

160
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:08,679
continuing to develop it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> conjunction</font>

161
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:11,199
like that but a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of our recent</font>

162
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:12,980
discussions have been to focus on what

163
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:16,099
specifically to remove

164
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,230
from the I guess the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard version of</font>

165
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,310
this draft that would create the version

166
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:24,470
for specification so I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a</font>

167
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,439
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a tactic for us might be to focus</font>

168
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:30,579
really on this standards version and

169
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,829
then to drop the aspects that relate to

170
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:35,660
versions one two and three but<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

171
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:37,729
the drop would be considered the the

172
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,579
informational submission like that it

173
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,470
contains all this legacy information it

174
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:46,089
contains documentation of depreciated

175
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:49,190
elements like that entirety<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font>

176
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:52,070
possibly a an informational submission

177
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:54,139
and then after the removal of the

178
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:57,380
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one two and three we could</font>

179
00:12:54,139 --> 00:13:02,779
have a standard submission for ritalin

180
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:04,820
for specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

181
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:07,670
makes a reasonable amount of sense and

182
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,380
that that this draft could probably be

183
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,800
modified to do those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so your</font>

184
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,720
intention would it be for when you say

185
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,910
you you're removing the things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

186
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,829
two and three you're you're then going

187
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,870
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> include those in a separate document</font>

188
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:22,130
that does not have anything for version

189
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,010
4 in it and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

190
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,319
publish this information I mean we are

191
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:32,389
certainly looking for for advice on on

192
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:35,660
how to proceed but I I think there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

193
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:37,519
is motivation for the participants to to

194
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,829
release in informational documentation

195
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,420
that reflects you know the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

196
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:44,989
matroska files that are already existent

197
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,430
to be seen you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as in as an</font>

198
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,000
informational submission as well as

199
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:52,489
having a more standardized focus for FF

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,139
4 version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 I mean I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know one of the</font>

201
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,540
comments we've received is that the

202
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:59,240
document is massive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can remove</font>

203
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,040
a lot of the work in progress remnants

204
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,569
that are still on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> documents and a</font>

205
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,029
lot of the documentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> on depreciated</font>

206
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:08,209
elements I think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really constrain</font>

207
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:09,740
this for a standard submission well its

208
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:11,239
presence for the informational

209
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,790
submission might be necessary to kind of

210
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,490
understand what happened in the history

211
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,439
of matroska right and and I think

212
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">generally for an informational draft um</font>

213
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,050
you know you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to include a</font>

214
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:26,529
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more with a lower review bar um so</font>

215
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,029
that that may be easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

216
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:30,649
now this has been and I'll address that

217
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:32,300
statement first and then back to what I

218
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:34,519
was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that's that is a true</font>

219
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">statement to some degree it's especially</font>

220
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,170
true if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it clear and</font>

221
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,180
informational that this draft this

222
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">document is documenting work that was</font>

223
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,019
done elsewhere as opposed to this is you

224
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:48,649
know new work being done on the ITF

225
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,529
obviously that's not true of the

226
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:54,050
proposed standard version now what I was

227
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:56,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to comment is the milestones were</font>

228
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,829
put together because of what people at

229
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,420
the time thought was the best way to

230
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:03,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">organize things they're not written in</font>

231
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,579
stone<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can be changed I think the</font>

232
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,279
separation we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is still</font>

233
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,920
probably a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good one and milestones can</font>

234
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,639
be worked in parallel if that works for

235
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,130
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group but I do caution</font>

236
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,320
people not to get caught up<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

237
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">critical path where everything is</font>

238
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,850
dependent on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest thing you know</font>

239
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,470
if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are if there are anything</font>

240
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,180
that's low hanging fruit we can get this

241
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">done quickly and show some output from</font>

242
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,349
the working group that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be nice</font>

243
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:41,000
yeah hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will to make some</font>

244
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:43,579
progress<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that respect today so so</font>

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,160
anyway um having not heard detailed

246
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:47,899
discussions on our detailed proposals

247
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,519
for when we should revise the dates for

248
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:51,019
these milestones I think Tess and I will

249
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,269
put together a proposal incentives<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

250
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:56,139
lists and people can complain there if

251
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,139
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with</font>

252
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:15,620
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just sorry so this slide was</font>

253
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:18,920
just Farrah reference to remind the

254
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">group of the deliverables so it ties</font>

255
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,790
into kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we were discussing</font>

256
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:25,970
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the milestones um I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

257
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:31,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need to discuss anything on this</font>

258
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:39,050
slide um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I guess without further</font>

259
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:41,900
ado Steve sorry I should give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

260
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,060
introduction steve is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

261
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:47,240
talking about matroska and<font color="#E5E5E5"> EB ml and I</font>

262
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:52,219
will let you present your own biography

263
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:55,880
as you yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> um quick thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about myself</font>

264
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:59,450
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I created could you say yeah step out</font>

265
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:05,680
of my life dude is it rough to stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

266
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:05,680
close<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still very closely</font>

267
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:15,708
so I'm Steve lon I'm from France<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

268
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,400
created not alone matroska based on

269
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:26,480
another format that never saw the light

270
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:29,990
of day the when we we I said we because

271
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:35,180
there was more people involved online in

272
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:38,600
a open community development rasca we

273
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:42,200
sub a good design would be something

274
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:45,379
like XML<font color="#CCCCCC"> been binary but not too verbose</font>

275
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:49,450
that so we created eb<font color="#CCCCCC"> mls the strut</font>

276
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:55,280
underlying structure from<font color="#E5E5E5"> etruscan and</font>

277
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:59,300
then matroska was built at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time</font>

278
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,389
so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues see to see if we</font>

279
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:05,060
could work on progressing and matroska

280
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,930
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BM e BML is not finish is</font>

281
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:11,080
completely doable because we're eb Mel's

282
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:14,799
already quite stable

283
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,559
and my choice car as a lot of stable

284
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,139
parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so a lot of stuff can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be done</font>

285
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:26,200

287
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:35,289
but myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I just did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a side</font>

288
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:39,580
project and it evolved<font color="#CCCCCC"> into something</font>

289
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:44,110
that's now used in web m4 so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

290
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:48,519
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of vp8 vp9 videos you watch in</font>

293
00:18:53,110 --> 00:19:01,330
using metro scale as well and now the

<font color="#E5E5E5">subject of the working group seller is</font>

296
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:14,500
for a storage of longtime preservation

299
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:28,750
involve the whole matroska design was

300
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:33,668
bait also for streaming videos that's

301
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:37,990
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google uses it I forgot to give you</font>

304
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:52,529
there you go so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the for the ebm</font>

306
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:59,049
were done in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside the matroska</font>

307
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:02,169
specifications later we did a side

308
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:08,110
project just for a BM l but<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

309
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:12,250
same information but just alone now

310
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:14,080
you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> right the I mean every</font>

311
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:17,169
changes to the current specifications

312
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,800
are done on github and discussed on the

313
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:24,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">seller mailing list and</font>

314
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:31,180
so that created<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ebm l draft</font>

315
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:34,950
RFC and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for matroska</font>

316
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:41,010
so there's also an<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft which is a</font>

317
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:43,840
in a very early stage it's basically the

318
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:47,560
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the information that was on the</font>

319
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:56,320
website even<font color="#E5E5E5"> not exactly specification</font>

320
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:58,419
stuff and cleaned up as an RC so some of

321
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,030
the issues identified from the

322
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:05,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussions on the mailing list or I can</font>

323
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:07,960
think of as in the specification<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

324
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,900
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is called timecode</font>

325
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,210
throughout the road matroska

326
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:16,570
specification is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> chilling something</font>

327
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:19,170
that's x then x cotton clothing with the

328
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:22,659
video world it's something you know the

329
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:25,270
dates and time you can see while playing

330
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,940
a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> in movies or stuff like that</font>

331
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,790
time stuff is actually something built

332
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,550
in the format you have audio and video

333
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:37,330
and subtitle synchronized it's not

334
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:38,649
something the user sees so something we

335
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,389
should really<font color="#E5E5E5"> change in the</font>

336
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifications as everything that's</font>

337
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:47,110
refer time code is actually changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

338
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,410
tensed and on top of that we do not have

339
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:53,260
proper<font color="#E5E5E5"> timecode support yet so the thing</font>

340
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:56,860
that people expect to see the time

341
00:21:53,260 --> 00:22:00,670
flowing that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is needed</font>

342
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:02,469
by archive people so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something</font>

343
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:09,310
that's being worked on in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Middle</font>

344
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:11,680
East and the Vienna spec room yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

345
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:16,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">does i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was Tim mentioned that</font>

346
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:19,390
the IBM<font color="#CCCCCC"> our specifications do refer to</font>

347
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:21,700
things they're actually defined later so

348
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that might be a bit of real boring of</font>

349
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:29,020
the text<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the paragraph so it flows</font>

350
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:32,550
more better so that's probably something

351
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,550
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done as well</font>

352
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:39,539
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maltese also may I already</font>

353
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:44,980
mentioned a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inside the matroska</font>

354
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:51,970
specifications<font color="#CCCCCC"> define things that are</font>

355
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:55,539
not yours useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for playback so like</font>

356
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:58,720
nine<font color="#E5E5E5"> words it's a very rare where you</font>

357
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:00,700
use feature that's not completely needed

358
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,919
now so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can drop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that from the</font>

359
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:08,049
specifications the<font color="#CCCCCC"> codec mapping</font>

360
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,539
definitions even on our website it's

361
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:13,179
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> saturated from the specification</font>

362
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:15,220
between because basically every codec

363
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:18,610
used in the container should have its

364
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:21,789
own document you say are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> map the</font>

365
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:26,860
codec data into matroska inside and out

366
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:32,370
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this probably are the parts that can</font>

367
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,370
be dropped<font color="#CCCCCC"> or elements they are not used</font>

368
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,700
now our single cell on the mailing list

369
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:43,299
was mentioned we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> define more what</font>

370
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:48,250
kind of attack can be done either on IBM

371
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:51,010
LMA troska so probably more work it

372
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:54,730
needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done for that because</font>

373
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:57,370
obviously since it's a complex format a

374
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:00,309
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be done there are</font>

375
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:05,080
general rules already explained in eb ml

376
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:08,529
that maybe we can be more specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font>

377
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">hatch star start time cuz i was talking</font>

378
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about before it's an ongoing discussion</font>

379
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:16,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this morning we had the talk with</font>

380
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,510
archivists to see what they need and

381
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:25,530
what exists already in their world so

382
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:28,560
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't reinvent the wheel sure</font>

383
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:31,290
so one of the things we could do as well

384
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,590
to reduce the size of this specification

385
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:37,050
is remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> the elements that have been</font>

386
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:42,480
deprecated for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and nobody</font>

387
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:45,149
actually use the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> for not a</font>

388
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,250
document an<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML document to generate</font>

389
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:50,160
code so it always matches the

390
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:52,620
specifications in that document will

391
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,960
keep the deprecated elements because we

392
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,989
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that curve to still be able to read</font>

393
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,530
these elements so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should</font>

394
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:04,170
still have one way somewhere to know

395
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:06,300
that desire not exist so somebody

396
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:10,950
doesn't try to use them for something

397
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:17,909
else so I propose to Damon in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the annex</font>

398
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:21,150
or one way or another yes also in order

399
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:24,060
to reduce the size of the documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

400
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:28,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">building of a system to or define what's</font>

401
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:31,830
a default values if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

402
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:34,290
value you do not have to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on the</font>

403
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:38,760
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> its implied by the semantics of the</font>

404
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:41,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">file so that was designed to avoid</font>

405
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:46,700
writing values they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the same</font>

406
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:49,770
which reduce the size of the file 0 when

407
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,890
elements do not have a different level

408
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:55,290
range level and it's meaningless for

409
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,390
these elements right now the written

410
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,030
because the original specifications

411
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:02,490
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a table so every cell of</font>

412
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:05,460
the table that to be filled we probably

413
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:08,330
don't need that anymore with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font>

414
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,330
format we have

415
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:16,740
that's what has been done what we

416
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:20,230
already discussed so in the future

417
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,960
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft</font>

418
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:26,260
and probably we need blood more comments

419
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:33,070
as well at least on ebn el which is

420
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:35,350
already know good shape<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

421
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:38,320
post obviously your questions on the

422
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:42,309
mailing list and whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel like</font>

423
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,639
talking about on the specifications<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

424
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:49,889
formatting probably could still

425
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:53,110
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the mattress casa de been</font>

426
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:57,689
improved that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's been</font>

427
00:26:53,110 --> 00:27:02,340
worked on and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are aware of that also</font>

428
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:04,870
like adherence to the ITF protocols

429
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:08,620
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all learning</font>

430
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:13,149
while we're doing this so but trying our

431
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:17,768
best and yourself from discussions with

432
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:20,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google we had recently they added a few</font>

433
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:25,929
elements to my true scale for their own

434
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:28,090
needs many of them for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example on the</font>

435
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:31,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">color space have been added</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and merged</font>

436
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:32,830
into matroska and a time here there's a

437
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:36,129
two elements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are needed for</font>

438
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:38,408
encryption that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to support</font>

439
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,389
white line which wouldn't work without

440
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:44,860
these elements so we are probably going

441
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:50,350
to add them into<font color="#E5E5E5"> metro sky as well to</font>

442
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:54,000
avoid conflict in the future and also

443
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:59,289
something else talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> or recently</font>

444
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,659
probably at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> debt now the semi BML</font>

445
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:05,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">and my Trescott are trimmed to des</font>

446
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:07,960
designed and the words then the

447
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:11,260
specification is when you go down one

448
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:14,409
will available<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree or up you say which</font>

449
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,899
level number you are but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very</font>

450
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:19,659
practical and not very readable so I

451
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:22,090
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we might change that formatting to</font>

452
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:24,190
just saying which parents

453
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:29,860
that element belongs to when it's a lot

454
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:32,500
clearer and faster to read and I think

455
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:36,428
that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me so you probably have a</font>

456
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:41,289
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions I hope except for days</font>

457
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:45,549
Dave knows everything the device I just

458
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:47,890
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> a supplement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit in our work</font>

459
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:49,870

<font color="#E5E5E5">part we're working on removing content</font>

465
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,190

466
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:08,250
mean there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of understanding</font>

467
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:13,750
comprehension and familiarity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of of xml</font>

Steve mentioned as part of the matroska

469
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,880
libraries there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML document that</font>

470
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:22,630
defines the matroska elemental structure

471
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,250
in XML so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the larger components</font>

472
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:27,730
that we added to the e.b ml

473
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,740
specification is that we define you BML

474
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:32,860
kind of it as an analogous for binary

475
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:36,190
format to xml then we add within that

476
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,320
specification away 22 right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andy BML</font>

the eb<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean ii BML schema is analogous</font>

480
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,600
to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml schema in that it defines what</font>

481
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,380
elements are available in what the

482
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:56,559
constraints and semantics are of a eb ml

483
00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:00,010
document of which matroska is is one so

484
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the vin eb ml work we're defining a lot</font>

485
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:06,730
of how matroska is to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined and you</font>

486
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,149
know hopefully prepping the way for

487
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:16,800
other formats to use binary xml as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

shins we have one hour where we have an

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:28,890
hour left Thomas Dayton<font color="#E5E5E5"> is oh um I want</font>

491
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to expand on the point earlier I was fun</font>

492
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,010
of people on the mailing list i was

493
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,379
making comments about the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

494
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do when you have a bad format or you</font>

495
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,070
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> an attack or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that the big</font>

496
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,320
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going for there is not so much</font>

497
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">just you know corrupted data but also</font>

498
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,970
just you know poor software or different

499
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,830
encoders because right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

500
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:50,910
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> many ways there are many many</font>

501
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">different ways to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encode a matroska file</font>

502
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,720
and the question is you know what what

503
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,880
is valid and if you make very many many

504
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,470
many things valid it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to get</font>

505
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself to the point where you start</font>

506
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,370
depending on player specific behavior

507
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,840
they may generate a file it may look

508
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,060
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> in being a one player and then the</font>

509
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,639
other player can't read it or plays in a

510
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">different way that's you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all</font>

511
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">working like you know you might make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

512
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,930
work one in one place but this is very

513
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">confusing and I think it's really</font>

514
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to be able to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff in</font>

515
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,420
the in the terms of the player behavior

516
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:23,399
so people realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have screwed</font>

517
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,770
up and they can say this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

518
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,840
valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> or this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't valid and auto just</font>

519
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:34,080
as we know it plays one player<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

520
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:37,100
in a BMA I think we'd try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover as</font>

521
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,689
much as we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of in terms of</font>

522
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:43,409
what you do when something bad happens

523
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:45,660
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Metro skites non-existent right now</font>

524
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:48,810
and we know we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on that and</font>

525
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:51,930
that's also the thing that the document

526
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:54,629
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so quite big right now but it's</font>

527
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:58,200
actually not as big as it should be

528
00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:00,030
because all the elements of like this I

529
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,260
don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never counted but that's</font>

530
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:07,230
probably like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 elements is each other</font>

531
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:10,170
like one or two or three lines

532
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:13,200
definition and that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough</font>

533
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:16,620
to explain for each of them what to

534
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,260
expect and what what to do and something

535
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:23,850
goes wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially for the important</font>

536
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,999
parts for playback like sizes and stuff

537
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,509
like that

538
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:31,329
so yeah the that's going to be a lot of

539
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:34,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the work I mean going from now because</font>

540
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:39,969
yeah we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to define a lot</font>

541
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:42,279
more precisely a lot of the elements no

542
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:44,379
one else comes up a couple more kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

543
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:46,089
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Muhammad what one is</font>

544
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,009
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one way to tackle</font>

545
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:51,698
this is you could probably define

546
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:53,049
something like a standard way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle</font>

547
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:54,519
this and that many of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> elements if</font>

548
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:56,559
you define what is valid you can then

549
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:59,619
give basically standard behavior such as

550
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,439
skip you know a skipped element and do

551
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:04,988
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> parsing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skip them you</font>

552
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:06,789
know skip skip its parent or it like so

553
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:08,709
you know however that bubbles up you can

554
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:09,819
opt you<font color="#E5E5E5"> two probably make something so</font>

555
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:13,029
you have to specify you know the

556
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:16,089
behavior how each each tiny change makes

557
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:18,159
it but you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be lit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

558
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:23,109
kind of there or it's actually when you

559
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:26,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">can detect it prior to reading like with</font>

560
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:29,139
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CRC and most of the time people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

561
00:33:26,229 --> 00:33:32,139
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear right CRC's in their files</font>

562
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:35,109
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something archive people do not</font>

563
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:38,589
like they want CRC's to know when

564
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:42,668
there's an arrow and isolate it as small

565
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:45,999
as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe fix it even so but</font>

566
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:48,489
they're so that's one case that probably

567
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:50,859
should bring the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ebm inspect because</font>

568
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:54,729
this year see is there and it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

569
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:59,829
anywhere in any way I BML master element

570
00:33:54,729 --> 00:34:03,309
in natural scale there's probably a lot

571
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:06,129
more scrutiny that can be put on

572
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:10,268
elements to see what could happen if

573
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:14,139
that element goes bad and I think that's

574
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:17,138
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you some of the stuff that like</font>

575
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:20,619
I could think of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> video size if you</font>

576
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:23,829
put something completely wrong or pixel

577
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:29,789
crop that ends up losing and negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

578
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:33,039
size image that kind of stuff yeah and

579
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:35,409
last thing is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was whenever Isis also</font>

580
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,560
you talk about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is little to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube</font>

581
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:40,720
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

582
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,279
ebm<font color="#CCCCCC"> l schema so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what the</font>

583
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,199
scope of that would be like is it going

584
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,990
to are you going to use to validate an

585
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:48,310
entire matroska document or is it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

586
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:50,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want do you want are you have like</font>

587
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:53,049
entire validation they're described to

588
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,210
the schema or is that going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

589
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:57,130
for the correctness of Annie BML

590
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:01,540
document but not necessary of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raza</font>

591
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:04,570
file it's certainly at least at the NBA

592
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:07,840
level and much was considered a semantic

593
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:10,210
is man I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if the logic can be</font>

594
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,750
putting that like like what I was just

595
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:15,520
saying you've pixel cropping gives you

596
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:19,420
invalid data I don't know if that can be

597
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:24,550
done by an external yeah I pbn a schema

598
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:27,340
I do not think so so I don't have this

599
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:29,710
like machine-readable things that exist

600
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:32,680
to do that it would certainly be good

601
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,720
because it's far as finally the answer

602
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,100
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the email schema can't validate</font>

603
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,189
a fall like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might need more</font>

604
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:43,540
information yeah but in the context of

605
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:45,970
video preservation if we can do as much

606
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:50,259
validation and that's something they're

607
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:53,319
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's actually something</font>

608
00:35:50,260 --> 00:36:01,150
that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reprove improve as much</font>

609
00:35:53,320 --> 00:36:02,980
as we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok Steve guys I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to ask</font>

610
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:07,810
you answer a bit of Thomas's question

611
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:11,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">too we're we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to use the the</font>

612
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:14,170
basis of the specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the xml</font>

613
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:18,250
schema to sort of influence how we can

614
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:21,760
define<font color="#E5E5E5"> eb ml schema so if if there is an</font>

615
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:23,380
analogy and an analogous method of

616
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,870
making such a declaration we're using

617
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,720
that and if we have to go outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

618
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,940
what can be done in xml schema we we are

619
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,029
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more cautious because we</font>

620
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:37,960
are defining something new in the case

621
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:41,290
of in the case of EV ml we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

622
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,600
areas where we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define a default</font>

623
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:46,210
value and in an XML schema you can

624
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,950
define a default even if the element is

625
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,290
present but we have a few instances

626
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,250
where the default is not a number or

627
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,890
string but it's a relator to

628
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:58,670
related element and this is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

629
00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:01,700
like not a part of what XML can do but

630
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:03,920
it's part of what matroska is currently

631
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,839
doing so this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

632
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,780
considerations of like having this kind

633
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:12,290
of relational element be a default for

634
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,370
another the other part is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had</font>

635
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:17,840
some discussions on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list</font>

636
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:20,270
about having having validation rules

637
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:23,180
based on equations of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> elements so</font>

638
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:26,509
the case you're talking about we're like

639
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,810
the the like pixel crop left can

640
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:32,840
certainly not exceed the the width or

641
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:35,210
like the the I guess pixel crop left

642
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:38,740
plus pixels crop right<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot be greater</font>

643
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:42,680
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the weights with the pictures with</font>

644
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:45,109
so so I mean we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

645
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,629
define how to express an equation of

646
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:50,930
related elements like how to get like an

647
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:52,580
ex-cop style expression to refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

648
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,680
related elements and then like what

649
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,170
types of equations we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font>

650
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,060
but I think it it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivating to</font>

651
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,650
move as much of the validation into

652
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:04,250
machine readable context in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the EPL</font>

653
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:07,130
schema as we can but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's</font>

654
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:10,360
certainly there's certainly a<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit to</font>

655
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we can do because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

656
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:17,120
recommendations<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the matroska document</font>

657
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:18,470
are you know implies it requires some

658
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,470
human intelligence to figure out if

659
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:23,290
they're being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used accurately at the</font>

660
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:26,029
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that it don't</font>

661
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:29,150
boil the ocean on eb ml by defining a

662
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:30,860
turing-complete and and then publishing

663
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,150
a reference implementation to be Phoebe

664
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:36,260
ml that's probably more than you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

665
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:38,690
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also this validation we're</font>

666
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:41,140
talking man is just for a schema so it

667
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:47,930
would be the mattress<font color="#CCCCCC"> k part doesn't</font>

668
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:51,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">imply eb ml validation like if you have</font>

669
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:54,080
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> master element the size of the</font>

670
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:57,200
elements inside cannot exceed the size

671
00:38:54,080 --> 00:39:00,560
of the master itself the element above

672
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,049
and that's the kind of thing that's not

673
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really defined in the schema but it's</font>

674
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually an important check to do</font>

675
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:09,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you can</font>

676
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:14,390
find that something is wrong if if you

677
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:16,820
find that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening so even a</font>

678
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:18,680
sight from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ebm esquina there are</font>

679
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,440
other checks that need to be done as

680
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:31,180
well there are not described completely

681
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:31,180
outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the schema anyone else</font>

682
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:42,410
Chairman's chairman and who cares

683
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:44,990
Chelsea any chairs so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I sent</font>

684
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:47,660
most of my specific comments on the the

685
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:49,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">eb ml document and to the list um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

686
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:55,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">least a few comments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the matroska one</font>

687
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:58,490
arm so we did have some discussion that

688
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the current matroska draft</font>

689
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:03,220
that was submitted directly supports the

690
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:06,320
two milestones um as we said before um

691
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:08,029
but the eb ml draft does seem to

692
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly support the milestone with that</font>

693
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:14,060
respect um so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we could</font>

694
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue a call for consensus to adopt that</font>

695
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:20,390
draft as a working group item um so

696
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:24,410
those of you who would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> adopt</font>

697
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:31,940
that draft please home now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eb ml 1</font>

698
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:33,830
yes eb ml draft don't get up this has

699
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">been yeah it's worth saying a couple of</font>

700
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:38,390
words what that means and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess i'll</font>

701
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:40,790
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but i just came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up here when you</font>

702
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:43,250
adopted draft doesn't mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it</font>

703
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:44,450
doesn't mean it's right it doesn't mean

704
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that every word and it won't change</font>

705
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:48,859
before you're done what it means is that

706
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,780
the working group believes that right

707
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,340
now that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best way forward to</font>

708
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:55,910
fulfilling that well piece of the

709
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:57,380
milestone right the question is do do

710
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,180
people in this working group think that

711
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:03,830
is a good start for fulfilling this

712
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:06,649
milestone this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is David Rice I think we</font>

713
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:08,660
have a short number maybe like a half a

714
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:11,120
dozen issues in the EV ml github trucker

715
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:14,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vmail specification that we need</font>

716
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,680
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve but i think this combined</font>

717
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:18,590
you're quite comprehensive comments

718
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,520
about the EV ml draft is is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

719
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,380
extent of like

720
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,360
our current<font color="#CCCCCC"> pots are between where the</font>

721
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,820
document is at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment and where it</font>

722
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,010
needs to get finished so if I understand

723
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:31,250
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being proposed</font>

724
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:33,650
now where we kind of have the the vision

725
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:36,710
is a bit you know constrained and

726
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:38,600
defined at this point and we know the

727
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:42,670
the tests we need to do to finish the

728
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:45,970
goal then I think we are at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

729
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:50,120
yeah we are fully aware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

730
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:53,810
ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> final specifications but yeah</font>

731
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:57,350
we would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a at least readable</font>

732
00:41:53,810 --> 00:42:01,490
and has a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful information</font>

733
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:04,759
that need to be there right so so yeah

734
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,259
the basic question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is you know do you</font>

735
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,140
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good starting point and</font>

736
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,180
and the other major difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

737
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,970
an individual draft and a working group

738
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,799
draft is that the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> editors will be</font>

739
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,330
responsible for representing the

740
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,220
consensus of the working group in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

741
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,860
document and not just their own personal

742
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,390
opinions even if they happen to disagree

743
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:27,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the consensus of the working group</font>

744
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:29,180
um but so with that in line um it occurs

745
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:31,250
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that many many of the people</font>

746
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:35,569
working on these documents probably have

747
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:37,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">never done an ITF hum before so when the</font>

748
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,110
chairs call for please hum for or

749
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:44,629
against a position like you're actually

750
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:47,810
supposed to hum in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room so let's</font>

751
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:50,930
let's try that again um all those who

752
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:53,450
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adopt the current current</font>

753
00:42:50,930 --> 00:43:00,290
draft to the 4 eb ml as a working group

754
00:42:53,450 --> 00:43:02,359
item please home now um and all those

755
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:05,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">who would not like to adopt the draft as</font>

756
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:09,050
a working group item please home now

757
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:11,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right that sounds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

758
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:15,640
consensus do it up to me I worked realms

759
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:19,240
in the channels rose<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you um</font>

760
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,240
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a louder</font>

761
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:32,150
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we will go confirm that</font>

762
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:34,160
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list um but at least we</font>

763
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:37,420
have one milestone that we've adopted a

764
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,420
document for so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good progress</font>

765
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:53,980
right okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right um I think then um</font>

766
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:57,230
unless there's any other<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions great</font>

767
00:43:53,980 --> 00:44:00,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think then thank you very much</font>

768
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:04,130
Steve oh you I think we'll move on to FF

769
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:12,440
e1 and Darrell Martinez is going to be

770
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:17,300
leading the discussion on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> joe</font>

771
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:25,130
Martinez so we will talk about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ffv</font>

772
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:29,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video formats the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AFC 4 over the</font>

773
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:31,990
left is on vaca<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have also a</font>

774
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:34,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">guitar pro positively hosted by FFM pay</font>

775
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:39,379
because if everyone was initially

776
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:43,009
created by ffmpeg one of ffmpeg

777
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,680
developers so I am NOT with developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

778
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:51,020
F everyone I am NOT were authorized

779
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:56,290
everyone if everyone was created by

780
00:44:51,020 --> 00:45:00,770
mckernon<font color="#CCCCCC"> emil and i helped to update the</font>

781
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:05,930
specification because the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we</font>

782
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:09,530
got with FF everyone was decoder encoder

783
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:11,629
and decoder directly it was coded and we

784
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:14,450
want to have something more turned out

785
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:17,450
so we are creating the corresponding

786
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:20,330
specification there was a first draft of

787
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:23,649
the specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> created by in mcallen</font>

788
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:26,990
Adhamiya and now i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> helping about</font>

789
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:32,530
having a better specification available

790
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:37,399
and something we can have in the ITF

791
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:40,100
so what we done we have done since the

792
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:43,540
beginning of the year we move from the

793
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:49,100
old leaks text format which was

794
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:53,390
initially used but this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very it</font>

795
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:56,569
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> also none as the mag done so we</font>

796
00:45:53,390 --> 00:46:02,839
switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> from leaks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> format to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> madden</font>

797
00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:07,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">of text format we we also a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dated a lot</font>

798
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:11,930
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ffv</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one specification in order to</font>

799
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:17,030
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> more details and we we don't</font>

800
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:20,990
want to have to dig in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FF impex code</font>

801
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:23,890
if for creating<font color="#E5E5E5"> a novel decoder so now</font>

802
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:27,319
we updated a lot with everyone

803
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:32,450
specification with frame more details

804
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:36,050
about the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a slider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

805
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:37,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">defined what is a plane how the</font>

806
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:42,170
bitstream is done for planes and lines

807
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:45,080
and there was already a lot of work

808
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:48,580
about how is the decompression method

809
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:55,819
how how is the algorithm so this part is

810
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:58,250
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was not touched we also created</font>

811
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:01,190
an independent<font color="#E5E5E5"> ffv one at limitation</font>

812
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:05,120
shaker in order to our to have to

813
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:09,650
implementation of a decoder not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the</font>

814
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:12,440
ffmpeg one so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a completely and</font>

815
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,690
deponent implementation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

816
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:19,430
specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> from scratch we don't we</font>

817
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:24,770
use a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> safe MPEG code and we hope</font>

818
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:26,960
with two decoders and 20 to be to see

819
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:29,509
what is wrong in the specification and

820
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,670
we want to fix everything in the

821
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:39,170
specification before submitting to the

822
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:41,750
ITF so the in the next six months we

823
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:45,200
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> update again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a more of a</font>

824
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:46,309
specification and for that we need some

825
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,430
peer review so

826
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:51,380
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for peer review and we</font>

827
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:54,739
want to create more test files in order

828
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:58,880
to cover all the scope of F everyone

829
00:47:54,739 --> 00:48:02,979
video format we want to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> bergey</font>

830
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:06,529
files so there's already some magnifies

831
00:48:02,979 --> 00:48:10,098
alive so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

832
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:12,559
specification can say what we should do

833
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:15,259
when we meet some such file we want to

834
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,420
create verifies in order to stress a bit

835
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:21,339
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> decoders and in order to see that</font>

836
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:26,569
the specification is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with that and</font>

837
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:32,328
we want first to standardize<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I ITF</font>

838
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:35,779
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already live for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone</font>

839
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:38,150
version they all one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and three and after</font>

840
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:43,729
that when it is finished we want to add

841
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:46,130
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> features to everyone because there's</font>

842
00:48:43,729 --> 00:48:51,229
some requests from other people for

843
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:54,049
adding different new features<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we</font>

844
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:57,618
don't wish you<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop some color spaces</font>

845
00:48:54,049 --> 00:49:00,380
like you are a B and lgb but we don't

846
00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:04,519
you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a barrier color space we don't</font>

847
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:07,999
support X Y Z and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we want to</font>

848
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:14,089
add that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 everyone in order to</font>

849
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:17,538
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> any video format any frame</font>

850
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:20,630
format in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the modifier in</font>

851
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:22,329
the video world and we want to to

852
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:26,559
increase the compression performance

853
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:29,029
while in adding we want to add some

854
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:34,880
different features for the better

855
00:49:29,029 --> 00:49:40,009
compression in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fev1 a term I just want</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clarify so for the first first</font>

857
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:46,939
document would be version 01 and three

858
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:49,009
is an informational document yes right

859
00:49:46,939 --> 00:49:52,098
and then it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very very swim all</font>

860
00:49:49,009 --> 00:49:55,150
the way the fights already exists it is

861
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:59,660
already a lot used so we cannot change

862
00:49:55,150 --> 00:50:02,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">something right so we want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

863
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:04,788
good explanation about what already

864
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:08,420
exists before moving forward to F

865
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:10,160
everyone version 4 and 4 question for we

866
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,829
can change things because it is not

867
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">already out right so version 4 would be</font>

868
00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:19,160
in the standards track yes right now

869
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:20,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you yeah I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to point</font>

879
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:49,069
basically no colorimetry information it

880
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:54,200
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just says everyone says you</font>

they'll switch it between<font color="#CCCCCC"> planer and</font>

883
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:00,589

demonstration giraffe includes tons of

885
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:04,339
all the color information is that the

886
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:07,490
general ideas you basically want to have

887
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:12,500
are all the color information in

888
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:15,140

working for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the first stage</font>

897
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:41,390
is to define transfer characteristic and

<font color="#E5E5E5">ought to be careful that is you have to</font>

914
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:19,190
carefully specify what happens because

915
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,500
now you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cop you may have two</font>

916
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:23,990
copies of information we know what one

917
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,510
in FF you know what ffv one version four

918
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,828
and one copy and the matroska

919
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:31,099
potentially still have to define what

920
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:32,599
this is not something specific to a 51

921
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:36,020
actually you can have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

between metascan h264 as justice also

has some color<font color="#CCCCCC"> of color space</font>

when information in metal container and

933
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:08,629
Jonathan sort of generalizing that a

934
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:10,190
little bit I mean you could also say

935
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in the standards track version of</font>

936
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,220
matroska and drop this information

937
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,290
because it's an f 51 I guess you want to

938
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,118
say do you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support standards</font>

939
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,259
track matroska with information left if

940
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,420
you want or<font color="#E5E5E5"> by store so you wanted to</font>

941
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:22,460
say that if you're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF a</font>

information ones are designed to work

945
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,440
together but so you're moving the

946
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,089
information not copying<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what I'm</font>

947
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,430
saying and then in general do you want

948
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:38,150
to say that it should these be mutually

949
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:39,859
dependent um we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to move</font>

950
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:42,680
something we won't have to end from the

<font color="#E5E5E5">information I've everywhere and the</font>

00:53:57,369 --> 00:54:05,200
such information not in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FF v 1 v</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">stream or not in every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> / video codec</font>

958
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,000
this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is often lost and we</font>

959
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:12,950
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to lose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> such important</font>

00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,109
other container already do that for

963
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:23,930
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> a movie quicktime they already</font>

964
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:26,540
safe such data in the container and

965
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:30,589
h.264 already<font color="#CCCCCC"> safe</font>

966
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:36,710
data so we we do the same as the the

967
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:42,140
ovals still trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer further the</font>

968
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:46,250
question actually every codec that's

969
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:49,670
putting matroska as a mapping to put it

970
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:55,580
inside and outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example in mp3</font>

971
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:58,760
yeah MPEG<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 or mp3 audio it's possible</font>

972
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:01,610
because mp3 is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a container and a</font>

973
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,250
codec even though it's small you can

974
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:07,790
remove completely a container part and

975
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:09,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and still work in matroska it's not</font>

976
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:12,950
often use because when you take it out

977
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:14,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">of matroska programs are lazy and they</font>

978
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:18,529
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take care of putting bad they're</font>

979
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:21,950
backed information but for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

980
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:24,170
now if everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is using the avi my pin</font>

981
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:27,080
with which is a general case for

982
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:30,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can put in avi you can put</font>

983
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:34,180
in my troska but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to</font>

984
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:37,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">define a specific mapping for FF v one</font>

put in removing hint of information

987
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:46,880
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already set in The Container so</font>

988
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:49,160
there's no redundancy not so that would

989
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,680
not be a possibility of having a

990
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,420
mismatch and when it's taken out and you

991
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,759
have to put it back take it from the

992
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:59,900
container and put it back in whatever

993
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:02,720
other format you will put and it's the

994
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:06,170
same for<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically every codec we're</font>

anything duplicated we have width height

00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:21,259
we have frame white it is often

1001
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:23,600
duplicated so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the only</font>

1002
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:26,450
information sometimes a container<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed</font>

1003
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:29,089
and sometimes we also need it in the

00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:30,859
bitstream in order to be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose</font>

1016
00:57:01,549 --> 00:57:05,920
container format probably has a reason

1017
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:08,809
to have information that's duplicative

1018
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,999
if someone is foolish enough to write a

1019
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:13,579
tool that allows inconsistent

1020
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:14,839
information then it's kind of on them

1021
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:16,789
you can kind of worn them into

1022
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:18,078
specification not to do that but I don't

1023
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:19,700
know that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to design the</font>

1024
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:25,819
container so that it's impossible to do

1025
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:28,700
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay on the topic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of conflicts I</font>

1026
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:32,029
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention that occasionally it's</font>

1027
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:35,359
it's it's it's intentional there are

1028
00:57:32,029 --> 00:57:37,789
some codecs that contain information

1029
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:40,819
such as like I'm thing about the DV

1030
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:45,380
codec contains a aspect ratio as a flag

1031
00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:48,259
that only supports like 43 in 69 so if

1032
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,839
DV information that is not that aspect

1033
00:57:48,259 --> 00:57:53,119
ratio is encoded at that like that value

1034
00:57:50,839 --> 00:57:56,390
could be overridden by the container the

1035
00:57:53,119 --> 00:58:00,319
correct information I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1036
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:03,259
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like if we want to a store a</font>

1037
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,029
bit stream in a container if if some of

1038
00:58:03,259 --> 00:58:06,680
the information of the bitstream cannot

1039
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:08,599
be clarified because of the limitations

1040
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,618
of that specification then we have the

1041
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:14,529
container that can correct it so if we

1042
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:17,900
have the if we have some content that is

1043
00:58:14,529 --> 00:58:20,299
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 19 aspect ratio and it's in</font>

1044
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,819

1045
00:58:20,299 --> 00:58:25,430
montrose co this this could be clarified

1046
00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:27,558
if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be clear in DV alone</font>

1047
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:30,469
it's not possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> the specification we</font>

1048
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:32,329
have to have a container<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is has a</font>

1049
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:35,509
specification that clarifies that the

information is intended to override

1051
00:58:35,509 --> 00:58:41,799
what's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dakota because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes the</font>

ah Thomas titty again missoula<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also</font>

1055
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:54,060

I want really want that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1057

disagree i would actually very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1058
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,819
the behavior when you have these

1059
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,979
mismatches to be specified<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be</font>

specified either in a mapping or in the

00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:07,680
matroska container depend how generic it

1062
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:10,500
can be um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just don't want the case</font>

1063
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,240
where people say they take a format they

1064
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,490
use davids a badly written you know if

1065
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,470
they use some buggy software they

1066
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:18,328
produce Billy's cut this conflict

1067

1073
00:59:28,589 --> 00:59:32,759
do that because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something more</font>

00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:40,710
every video or audio format so putting

01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:06,660
yes it's not as if this is all to find

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I mean there are many</font>

1090
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:18,750
significant characteristics are video

1091
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:21,779
that are traditionally held in the

1092
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:26,220
encoding such as like the color space

1093
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:27,780
information in h.264 in<font color="#CCCCCC"> prores and some</font>

1094
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:30,328
streams like will declare if their

broadcast range<font color="#CCCCCC"> ouran or full range but</font>

1096
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:35,069
I'm not aware of any container that that

1097
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,140
stores this information but part of the

1098
01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:39,930
goals of matroska is to also document

1099
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:41,970
uncompressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> video which has no ability</font>

1100
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:44,540
to describe any of these characteristics

1101
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:48,240
at all so every all these

1102
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:50,940
characteristics that are even you know

1103
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,959
more typically put into the encoding in

1104
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:56,520
more modern codex is not possible with

1105
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:58,290
uncompressed video so the video like

1106
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,770
that we have to rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a container</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1107
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:01,020
do

1108
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:03,120
everything I know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> QuickTime</font>

1109
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:05,759
specification is there are some parts of

1110
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,440
the specification<font color="#CCCCCC"> that say if the</font>

1111
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,600
containers used to store uncompressed

1112
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,040
video then these particular parts are

1113
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:15,360
mandated but if the content is not then

1114
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,750
they aren't so potentially we could add

1115
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:21,180
some conditional constraints and

1116
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:22,860
conditional mandates a you know to

1117
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,450
clarify like when the data should be

1118
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:37,020
used or when it should be deferred to

1119
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:39,720
the encoding although Christians we are

1120
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:45,000
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Debra from Peter boob stinger</font>

you Peter okay if any other questions

1127
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:16,740
of time but i think but i went to talk

1128
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,240
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the session was</font>

01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:22,229
moving forward and our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps</font>

1130
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,990
discussed the possibility of an

1131
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:27,750
in-person meeting in 2017 if the group

1132
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:32,490
finds it necessary in chicago in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> march</font>

1133
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:35,370
of 2017<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we kind of discussed or</font>

1134
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:36,990
started to discuss two and three as to

1135
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:40,430
mention t and i will review the

1136
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:44,879
milestones and then circulate revised

1137
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:49,799
schedule to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list and then i think</font>

1138
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:53,720

group was approved so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if</font>

01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:41,460
anybody here is has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">flack not as part of this group but you</font>

1175
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:50,970
know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> in general is been following</font>

1176
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:55,170
the developer list there nope David Rice

1177
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:58,799
I mean I I helped organize the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1178
01:04:55,170 --> 01:05:01,680
markdown to RFC draft conversion for

1179
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:04,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">APML matroska and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FF II one so if like</font>

1180
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,839
one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blocking issues</font>

1181
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,840
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups a commentary on</font>

1182
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:12,540
black is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that it exists in I</font>

1183
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:15,780
think it's in HTML in a in their own

1184
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:17,430
github repository I could I mean I could

1185
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:20,490
help right the the make file to make the

1186
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:22,230
conversion from the specification as it

1187
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:25,709
exists in their current form as the

1188
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:28,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">community maintains it into RFC</font>

1189
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:31,500
so that we you know can have the

1190
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:34,080
document in a form that is comfortably

1191
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:36,800
reviewable by both communities the the

1192
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:40,799
working group and the fact developers um

1193
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:43,410
but I would yeah they're there needs to

1194
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,210
be some type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bridge between the two</font>

1195
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:49,259
communities to like this I'll take the

1196
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:51,720
discussion better right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

1197
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:54,089
agree I don't know that if there's any

1198
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:58,490
sort of cross participation<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they</font>

1199
01:05:54,089 --> 01:06:01,710
between the flak and the you know and

1200
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:04,470
the seller<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob sorry at the seller</font>

1201
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:07,320
working group so that I think

1202
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:11,700
communicating with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flack developers</font>

1203
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:14,599
and writing the make file to get that

1204
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:18,839
into the IRC format would be spectacular

1205
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:20,700
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's I mean you know i'm</font>

1206
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to assign your you know</font>

1207
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:25,319
speaked something something that will

1208
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:26,279
assign work to somebody else but you

1209
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,480
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1210
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be done in parallel with the</font>

1211
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:34,260
current but they got current working

1212
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:36,930
working group milestones<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think</font>

1213
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:39,030
you know it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font>

1214
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:41,419
controversial or require extensive

1215
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:47,790
review you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be wrong but</font>

1216
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:51,150
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's my viewpoint so if there's</font>

1217
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:59,810
any way anybody else has a differing

01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:46,270
this is David Rice yes I mean I i should

1227
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:48,100
say like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the process to build up</font>

1228
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:52,380
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meeting has been especially</font>

1229
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:55,060
helpful that I mean the july eight a

1230
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:56,560
deadline for the submission of drafts

1231
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,870
for consideration for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion</font>

1232
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:02,700
here like was a big motivator because a

1233
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:05,290
lot of us are quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> deadline driven so</font>

1234
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:07,149
you will notice a huge amount of work

1235
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:10,480
happened because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of because of this</font>

1236
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:15,010
deadline um particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> on matroska</font>

1237
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:18,010
matroska was not in good shape for this

1238
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:21,089
kind of draft submission at this time so

1239
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:24,100
there was a lot of work to kind of

1240
01:08:21,089 --> 01:08:25,660
adjust the formatting and gather missing

1241
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:29,859
sections like security considerations

1242
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:31,839
and abstracts so the this the structure

1243
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:34,660
of preparing for the meeting helped

1244
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:35,950
quite a bit also<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know now that we are</font>

1245
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">eternally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the meeting like a lot of</font>

1246
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:38,979
the commentary like that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and</font>

1247
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:40,510
others had provided is quite

1248
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:44,080
comprehensive and give this a lot of

1249
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">work to address between now and the next</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting i think i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to state</font>

1251
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:51,810
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the historical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> record just exactly</font>

1252
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:56,200
how big the matroska specification is

1253
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:58,839
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess this is this is sort of one</font>

1254
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:01,269
question to get advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> on because we</font>

1255
01:08:58,839 --> 01:09:02,620
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> makefile that turns that</font>

1256
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:07,060
concatenates a collection of markdown

1257
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:08,890
files and we have the eb ml schema

1258
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:10,839
representation of matroska which is an

1259
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:13,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">xml document to define the structure so</font>

1260
01:09:10,839 --> 01:09:15,910
I made an XSL to convert it into mark

1261
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:20,950
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run it through mm mark to run</font>

1262
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:24,279
through XML to RFC the total pile is 220

1263
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:25,809
pages at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

1264
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:28,300
quite massive I think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1265
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:30,130
changes i can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can it for instance</font>

1266
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,680
if i make some optimization to the

1267
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:35,170
conversion of the eb ml schema to mark

1268
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:37,810
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably throw out</font>

1269
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:41,680
60 pages of white space in and how that

1270
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:43,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">is presented in the RFC so some some</font>

1271
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:46,120
minor work can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that number down</font>

1272
01:09:43,089 --> 01:09:47,290
quite substantially something where I'm

1273
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:50,290
not

1277
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,550
specifications but there are a couple

1278
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,870
sections of matroska that are you know

1279
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:03,550
quite quite relevant to move into

1280
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:07,019
separate sections for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1281
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:09,490
matroska specification defines a

1282
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:12,310
structural component for how tags are

1283
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:14,889
stored and they are semantically defined

1284
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:18,700
and then the document also contains a

1285
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:20,440
lot of space attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a specific tags</font>

1286
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:23,290
that can be used within that structure

1287
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:25,750
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the metadata vocabulary</font>

1288
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:28,360
of matroska could stand alone<font color="#E5E5E5"> as its own</font>

1289

1290
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:34,929
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much dependent on the matroska one</font>

1291
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:38,470
the other one is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1297
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,880
used in machine-readable context but I

1298
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:58,210
presumed it would be a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more</font>

1299
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,710
reviewable if we converted it have the

<font color="#E5E5E5">process to convert it to mark down so</font>

1301
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:05,290
that there's tables in the RFC draft

1302
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:07,270
rather than just like a bra<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML dump but</font>

having the tables and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> XML is of</font>

I'm both glad and horrified to hear that

1314
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:47,200
the deadlines to drive work or an

attractive nuisance of the IETF IM poor

1316

people to try to not get into that habit

1317
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:54,460
work can happen anytime we don't have to

1318
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:58,269
be in meetings to discuss things is

1319
01:11:54,460 --> 01:12:00,750
mailing lists and such especially if

1320
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:03,270
you're planning a meeting cadence of

1321
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:05,880
you know once a year or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess that's</font>

1323
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,950
maybe but still so you do end up with

1324
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,900
the you're in danger of ending up with

1325
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:15,210
the great big Python that just ate the

that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most efficient way to</font>

keep in mind with your meeting schedule

on the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document I thought I</font>

of massively big document to get 20

people in case people didn't know that

1344
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:07,589
the it can be useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

unicode point the the Bo thing I'll say

1356
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:50,550
now when you start by talking about the

<font color="#E5E5E5">XML being what people use versus the</font>

1358
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:57,140
text being explanatory we need to be

1359
01:13:52,920 --> 01:14:02,310
careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we consider normative</font>

1360
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:04,170
and if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i heard the idea</font>

1361
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:06,720
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> xml might be the normative part</font>

1362
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:09,210
and everything else maybe explanatory

1363
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:12,710
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not out of the question but</font>

1364
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:14,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">that requires some thinking about it and</font>

1365
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:17,420
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1366
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:19,799
good answer can that we have done

1367
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:21,480
strange things with codex in the past

1368
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,690
we're probably not going to do again for

1369
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:27,659
example having code be normative in

1370
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:30,960
openness but right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if I understood</font>

1371
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:33,809
correctly you're generating a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1372
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:39,929
tables in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matroska draft</font>

1373
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:42,119
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML yeah yeah so so it there</font>

1374
01:14:39,929 --> 01:14:44,690
may be fewer issues if the explanatory

1375
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:47,480
part is machine generated from the I

1376
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:49,469
guess it depends on if you have a

1377
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:51,388
someone else who's going to implement

1378
01:14:49,469 --> 01:14:54,869
this from scratch what do you expect

1379
01:14:51,389 --> 01:14:57,679
them to use to implement from so just a

1380
01:14:54,869 --> 01:15:02,009
clarifying comment like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to Ben um</font>

1381
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:05,880
we we've kind of adopted this from the

1382
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:07,980
way a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of XML documents are</font>

1383
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,360
standardized<font color="#E5E5E5"> where there'll be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML</font>

1384
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:12,209
schema which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine readable</font>

1385
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:16,139
version and we can use tools like XML

1386
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:17,579
into to do validation and there will

1387
01:15:16,139 --> 01:15:21,300
usually have to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human readable</font>

1388
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:23,070
component of the same information and in

1389
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,199
many instances I've seen the human

1390
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:28,199
readable component is produced from the

1391
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:31,369
the machine readable one so one is one

1392
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:37,159
is the derivative<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other I mean</font>

1393
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:40,079
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ebm L had been conceived of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> XML as</font>

1398

as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> how normative if it is to the</font>

rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the documentation</font>

1400
01:15:55,990 --> 01:16:00,490
ok I think that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough for now</font>

1401
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:02,740
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just something we kind of need to</font>

1402
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:05,530
keep track up normative xml is not an

1403
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:07,630
unusual thing but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to be</font>

1404
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:09,040
clear that so that a developer who's new

knows what they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be paying</font>

1406
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:14,560
attention to um do we have examples of

01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:16,300
other RFC's that have had normative xml
