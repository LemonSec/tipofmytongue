00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:17,060
looks good enough word yeah okay hello

co-chairs together is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the common refuse</font>

6
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:30,030
to do the introduction right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now well we</font>

7
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,369
have tight schedule<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this year we only</font>

8
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,759
get one love almost for the workshop

9
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:38,850
unlike past years so let's likely start

10
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,979
so for the first four speakers i have

11
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,990
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area in</font>

12
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,940
this area for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the camera don't forget</font>

13
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,440
that everything you say is recorded and

14
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:56,069
broadcaster and and we also passing

15
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:01,759
around this blue sheet where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

16
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:01,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">well conservatism</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i would like</font>

17
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:14,670
so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to ask the first</font>

18
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaker people to start um since we have</font>

19
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,429
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speak very careful</font>

20
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">with how much time you use we calculated</font>

21
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,150
20 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> first a committee need not</font>

22
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,709
seek relief including question sir so

23
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,180
the more questions you want which is

24
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,520
actually the interesting part right when

25
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,280
you come to an ITF needy as I shorter

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:39,510
you should make your speech speech<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,380
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fair to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use this earth it's great</font>

28
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,519
definitely yes

29
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:49,310
so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for introducing me and also</font>

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:53,950
for this opportunity do you think

31
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:58,460
microphone is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ugly oh I need to yeah ok</font>

32
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,350
so I'm better Elena<font color="#E5E5E5"> zolani I'm the new</font>

43
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,610
based on four fundamental principles the

first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network control and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the network farting logic is obstructed</font>

50

from hardware to program all

control element is introduced it to

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,620
coordinate network-wide 14 decisions and

54
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:12,709
also a sdn has a flexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture</font>

55
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:15,350
with four planes the application plane

00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:24,590
application plane comprehends the net

plane comprehends the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN controllers</font>

61
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:35,300
the folding plane comprehends the set of

62
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,530
simple farting devices and the

63
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,460
management plane comprehends the

64
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:43,130
management solutions for example

65
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:48,070
solutions to resource allocation and

66
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:50,360
monitoring device status and nowadays

67
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:54,590
the most relevant as the end

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,290
implementation is stay open for protocol

69
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,159
because of these principles and it's

70
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:02,630
flexible architecture as the end a

71
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,790
reduces or even eliminate some

72
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,950
traditional management problems for

73
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,930
example enabling network configuration

80

management contacts and there can be

81
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:31,760
considerably different from traditional

and some proposals are that centralized

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,750
control channel and also another

proposals<font color="#CCCCCC"> like devil flow and the fain</font>

91
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,670
attempted to alleviate these bottlenecks

by distributing the control logic open

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,510
basically we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have two contributions the</font>

112
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,849
first one is the control channel

analysis that we quantify the overheads

114

by impulse it by Oakland full control

115
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,860

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,039
interactive approach

123
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:33,030

<font color="#E5E5E5">those arrival giving a idle timeout</font>

199
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:31,209
observe when we set this idle timeout to

00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:35,920

seventy-seven percent of these rules

203
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:46,210
I'll the reason of this amount of idle

204
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:51,830
rules is because most of users are

<font color="#E5E5E5">request a web file web it requests do a</font>

the message that our exchanges to

but the overhead imposed for monitoring

228
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:11,780
is lower because we don't have too many

to a higher values we have more overhead

more rules to to monitor but we have

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:30,050
more less installation process in this

234
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:33,050
in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this means that the</font>

301
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,579
we can see that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

303
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,740
can see also that we lose we have a

305

307
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,770
also interesting to to see that in the

308
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:31,550
last configuration that mr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> show to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

he decreased the polling frequency to 50

311
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:41,540

314
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:51,520
to our control channel analysis we

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,590
identified that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single factor</font>

all the difference on both resource

319

load and through our prototype we we

320
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,970
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to retrieve statistic about</font>

330

major challenge of our work was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>

with the control channel statistics that

in our case there are different

334
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">currently there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is no standardized</font>

348
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:43,600
implementation in a campus network was

349
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,330
your test bed let's say where you deploy

350
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,879
your your prototype or you're seeing

351
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:51,310
your simulations but why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hope how</font>

352
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,350
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you imagine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open flow network</font>

353
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:55,270
deployment using different controllers

354
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,409
why would an administrator try to use

355
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,410
only a single controller

356
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:05,030
is there any case that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

357
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:07,428
yeah we only consider one only one

358
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:10,910
controller but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you consider more</font>

359
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:13,850
than one yeah we should implement more

360
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,920
drivers because there are different

361
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,219
implementations and we could not address

362
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,650
for example we used floodlight our

363
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,679
modified food light if you want to use

364
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:27,380
box or you you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement a</font>

365
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:32,049
specific driver to retrieve<font color="#CCCCCC"> this same</font>

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:36,110
information to to use in our prototype

367
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:38,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measurements do you</font>

368
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,040
envision or do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see any sort of</font>

any consideration on that we only

this in this case of the prototype but

00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:22,970
it can be generalized on any other kinds

409
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:52,039
caveats like if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do some</font>

410
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,019
forensic analysis you want to learn from

others that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already detected or</font>

412
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:58,940
improve your techniques or verify if the

00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:02,809
attack is to positive or both negative

414
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:05,659
it's a trap how it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done very cool</font>

415
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:10,730
with only flow based unless so our goal

416
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:13,940
was to pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is it better right</font>

417
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:17,619
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> our goal is to automate the light</font>

418
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:22,519

421
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:31,009
altogether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would like to combine the</font>

423
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:37,609

424
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">basic we have a turn up for computation</font>

425

426
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:46,219

427
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:49,190

428
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:52,279
extend this to sdn we call it

429
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:56,210
software-defined monitoring this our

430
00:23:52,279 --> 00:24:01,639
concept we create a special network are

431
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:03,859
on 100g it includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pga core and this</font>

432
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:06,709
capable of filtration medication and

433
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:09,439
computation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flows so using this</font>

434
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:12,019
technology we can offload the

436
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:16,730
and we can spare some resources on the

00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:23,990
for other computations so on a highlight

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,890
principle we have the mercury Pro the

analyzed by some application identifier

444
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,730
for example if the same position

446

00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:46,760
detect these<font color="#E5E5E5"> network incidents and we</font>

448
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:49,130
want to give the feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> the alert when</font>

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:52,070
the incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> is detected back to the</font>

450
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,230
monitoring probe with SDM and start the

451
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,090
full packet capture it so from<font color="#CCCCCC"> now on</font>

452
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,310
the full packet capturing will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

455
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:07,510
data from the past so the time machine

456
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:10,670
technology so our real-time approach

457
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:13,480
we've included will give the film are

458
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:18,110
implemented on the car the light drink

459
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:21,170
so getting to the time machine we've

460
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:24,260
looked at the technology or the proposal

461
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:26,300
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> coordinates lamp axons building</font>

462
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,980
a time machine for action recordings and

00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:32,060
receive a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-volume networking traffic</font>

464
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:34,790
and 2005 they use the storage of

465
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:38,060
packages on hard drive which is nowadays

466
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:40,700
some hopefully because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can store so</font>

467
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:43,250
much data on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on hard drives and</font>

468
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,740
they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for long range 3 g's the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">coronas was that not all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> packets have</font>

470

471
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,340

475
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting for us so our modification</font>

476
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:07,910
to the SVM time machine we use the

477
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,889
principles but and I sit by storing the

478
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:13,130

479
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:16,280
into DRAM which is much faster we use

480
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,440
technology for 100g we implemented the

481
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,260
software ring buffer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> give us as</font>

482
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,660
much space as we need or it's given in

483
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,629
the ramp and restores only the first end

484
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:29,450
packets of each<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow that can be stored</font>

485
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:32,960

486
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:35,270
so giving this when the other is

487
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,130
reported we are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start the full</font>

491

way we can look like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past so if</font>

494
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,750

<font color="#E5E5E5">using the SDM if they machine we can get</font>

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:25,080
incidents from the past so you might ask

504
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:27,409
are the end but gets enough so we've

505
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,960
done some monitoring or our network and

506
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:34,559
we find out that the aggregation is the

and person is the data that I'm not so

512
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:51,299
interesting for you because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so it</font>

518
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:10,710
we choose decision threshold at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

522
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:22,559
stored in the ram so with the decision

523
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:25,110

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:42,809
that's used but in general it's it's

528
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:47,189
this so the machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've used for</font>

529
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:51,360
the sting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> contains two CPUs overall</font>

532
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:01,950

537
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:16,649
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could store about 15 minutes of</font>

00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,490
the incident start full packet capturing

542
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:32,070
and retrieve the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data from the past but</font>

543
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,100
these numbers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very dependent on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

traffic volume distribution etc so it

546
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:45,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">might differ so some other measurement</font>

547
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:48,870
on the configuration how many or<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:02,970
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about eight thousand seconds but</font>

552
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:05,340
it's unacceptable most dimes so we find

00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:09,179
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the most reasonable trade mole</font>

554
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:12,059
is around 10 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it will destroy</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">all we are we have the most success rate</font>

556
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:19,639
in detective of the incidents so but

557
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:22,229
look at the use case of see fraud attack

558
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,270
the basics<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the attack is a</font>

00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:28,350
pre-configured private branch exchange

560
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:30,660
on some company using this technology on

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,689
our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> we observe around or video</font>

562
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,730
observe around four of these attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

563
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:40,169
different attacks per day on our

00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">be interesting for some companies to</font>

know that they are vulnerable for this

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,750
kind of attacks it's based on boot

568
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,590
configuration because some

569
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:56,820
administrators just forget to to exclude

section of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and its effects</font>

574

unfitted by malware or under to come

576

and attacker starts to guess the secret

00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,770
predicts that you include before the

00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:45,890
the attack is successful attacker just

587
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:51,169
starts the call and withdraw the money

588
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:53,050
from the paid service so the sip session

589
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:56,330
initiation protocol is text based

590
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:59,060
protocol it contains just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> messages</font>

591
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,980
and this message messages can be parsed

592
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,860
on the computer or the combination

593
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:07,310
hardware that that's used for the

594
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:10,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">capturing order for the product so we</font>

595
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:15,260
just extend the IP fix that we use for

596
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:17,990
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> net flow exports and we include the</font>

597
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:20,629
URL from the invite messages and we

598
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:24,200
observe because that<font color="#CCCCCC"> rhv</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so when the</font>

599
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:27,260
attack is successful the server results

600
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">they or return the message 200</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

601
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:32,840
the call can't start so typical attack

602
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:35,390
looks like this other concerns very

603
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,720
large amount of invites with different

604
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:41,810
prefixes the server returns this message

605
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when the attack is successful you</font>

606
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:47,179
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> observe this pattern so perfect</font>

607
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,850
guessing you can imagine in this way

608
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:55,100
this is the private number prefixes and

609
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:57,830
attacker tries to get this prefixes so

610
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,510
how we can detect this attack from point

611
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,280
of network architecture we just need to

612
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:04,370
be in the middle into<font color="#E5E5E5"> interstellar</font>

613
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,940
communication monitor pro export IP fix

614
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:10,310
and using<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own system that does not</font>

615
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,710
have developed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nimiya the intrusion</font>

616
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:15,440
detection system which is based on flow

617
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:17,389
processing or stream processing of net

618
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,969
flows it can be text

619
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:22,668
this kind of attacks and white control

620
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:24,259
and report to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a supervisor and give the</font>

on and the threshold on which it can

625
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:40,009
test that this is the attack or this is

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack so you can imagine like</font>

627
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:45,859
this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some domain some number</font>

628
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:49,700
and a lot of sub trees with the prefixes

629
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:52,908
that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be called so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

630
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:56,269
the typical pattern of this attack our

631
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:58,729
monitoring or the visualization so we

632
00:33:56,269 --> 00:34:01,190
can conclude this dispute the system

633
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:03,709
we've used the open source network

634
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,679
forensic analysis tool of detective that

635

638
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:17,569
information from application layer and

639
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:20,210
it mostly they are used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

640
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:23,629
forensic analysis so it can operate with

641
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:26,349
vary among large amount of a certain

642
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:31,210
protocols and it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily easily</font>

643
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:34,879
extended so for the visualization path

644
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:37,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented into this tool to be an</font>

645
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,319
monitoring center or the overview and

646
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,419
this is the architecture that the

647
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:44,299
administrator couldn't see when he

648
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:46,308
deployed this technology can see the

649
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:48,409
process of the monitoring or the

650
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:52,149
detection of the attack the suspicious

651
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:55,339
eye peas transfers of the pcap files etc

652
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:57,529
from this table the<font color="#E5E5E5"> unrest a jury could</font>

653
00:34:55,339 --> 00:35:00,940
see able to attack was successful all

654
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:04,069
filter the communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find out if</font>

655
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,109
it's real attack or not so this tool

656
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:08,630
also generates the prefix trees so you

657
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:10,400
can easily see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

658
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,680
positive or both<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative of the attack</font>

659
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,880
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> it provides some additional</font>

660
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:19,669
information like performance statistics

661
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:23,329

665
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,710
layers etc

666
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:35,810
sometimes in my views will to see some

667
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:39,830
packets chance to detect some kind of

668
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:41,570
attacks and of course the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

669
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:44,630
functionality the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word shark like</font>

670
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:48,770
approach to see the inner outer pockets

671
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:51,670
so conclude this presentation we

672
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:55,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">developed technology to monitor 100g</font>

673
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:58,910
we've extended the flow records of the

674
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:01,790
application antivirus based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our</font>

extension have been implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> into pga</font>

676
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:08,420
and the present system provides for

677
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:11,569
records food packet capturing on the 100

678
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">g and it enables you to see the history</font>

679
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:16,040
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> communication from the point</font>

680
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,009
where the attack actually occurred on

681
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:22,220
the network and to reach the gap before

682
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:25,250
the detection so you get all the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

683
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:27,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cat city so thank you for your</font>

follow us on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter or so on so thanks</font>

687
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:44,720
again and the questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alexandra lemon</font>

691
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:59,330
an important data and then the attack

692
00:36:55,850 --> 00:37:01,100
vector passes through undetected yeah do

693
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:04,340
you have anything in plans to avoid that

694
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:07,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">or is it your system even susceptible to</font>

695
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:10,160
it well it would depend on the

696
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring mechanisms of the</font>

697
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,600
interrelations is that if it's able to

698
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:16,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">go with this kind of attacks or not if</font>

699
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's detectable from the extended</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> falls</font>

700
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:22,190
or not to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not I'm not the right</font>

701
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:24,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">we drive this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> against this this</font>

702
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:26,570
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks we mainly focus on the</font>

703
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:29,810
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> common attacks on our network and</font>

704
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:34,250
to provide us the feedback if we are

705
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:36,830
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do monitor or detect</font>

706
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:40,640
this kind kind of sucks actually and if

707
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:43,549
it if the detection are too positive or

708
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,029
we are just observing something that

709
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:47,750
isn't

710
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:49,930
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks so the question I'm not</font>

711
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:52,700
aware if we tried in this kind of attack

712
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:57,009
can you thank you for your answer let's

713
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,009
have a conversation afterwards thank you

714
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,810
Geronimo from the floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> International</font>

715
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:06,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">University I saw you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a network tab</font>

716
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:08,570
ah so it's a way for you to monitoring

717
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:10,880
the communication but you guys have any

718
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:14,540
plans you're starting to review the case

719
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,150
you see an attack less close a call that

720
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,950
thank you for excellent question we are

721
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,570
currently developing a solution that

722
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,569
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to filter the</font>

723
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:26,210
communication and divert the traffic

724
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:29,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> contains the attack or just been</font>

725
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:31,040
eight or so on so for now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

726
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,169
developing the solution for this

727
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,660
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it should be available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

728
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:42,920
think in december this year<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you</font>

729
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:45,170
thanks i saw a very nice presentation so

730
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,760
it's on the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines on what he has</font>

731
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:52,970
asked so the tap device would relate the

732
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,600

effect on the throughput no you have no

no effect on the proposed it's just the

medic i'm francesco yeah thanks for

757
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:22,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the question other questions look um</font>

758
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:26,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we still have time to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

759
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:29,279
either one question when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you showed that</font>

760
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:32,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the statistics about how many peckers</font>

761
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:37,920
you would need for for the number for

762
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:41,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the different protocols yeah but ready</font>

763
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,500
to blow blows idea I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

764
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:46,350
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you cannot detect the protocol</font>

765
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,880
right or online so you cannot say you

766
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:50,940
want diplom of packets for different

767
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,370
protocols well we we can we can detect

768
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:57,000
the protocols based on some primitive

769
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:59,310
and was like the port number about none

770
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,570
for now not nothing so so much

771
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:04,259
intelligent like machine learning

772
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:06,900
methods or of something okay because i

773
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,080
was asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> leak awesome SSH I see</font>

774

there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but 11</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so it</font>

775
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:17,310
would be yeah it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground for 22</font>

776
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:20,850
the education of the stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> no okay</font>

777
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:29,610
thanks no questions you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's sexy</font>

778

00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:24,970
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have synchronized what isn't a</font>

787
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:26,740
burst of time come on okay um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

788
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:28,598
the time to ask the question how many

789
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:32,379
people are subscribed to the energy

790
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:34,480
mailing list raise your hand please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

791
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:38,079
next time I want next year I want to see

792
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,519
more hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> no so just joking so if</font>

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,499
measurement for management part which is

796
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:49,779
what of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire my energy here</font>

797
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:54,959
actually we have one of the energy what

798
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:54,960
is your official time actually chairs

799

805
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:38,950
limited and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you</font>

806
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,640
about an experiment with it together

807
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:45,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a lack Nick measuring connectivity</font>

808
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:51,819
in south america and caribbean so a

809
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:53,019
little line line<font color="#CCCCCC"> out we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

810
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:55,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the challenge of measuring the</font>

811
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:57,459
region with the already available right

812
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,349
atlas for example they're not so many

813
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:02,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">process there so i won't tell how we</font>

814
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:04,539
overcame that problem with software

815
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,788
probes I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk you about the</font>

816
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:08,619
experiment how it did with the fine

817
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:11,640
connectivity since we don't have a

818
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:14,859
standard definition for connectivity so

819
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,620
we defined there and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

820
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:17,029
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

821
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">alson discuss a little bit about that</font>

822
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:23,480
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we find after they doing</font>

823
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:25,850
these measurements ok so the Latin

824
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,700
American and Caribbean region doesn't

825
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:31,040
have too many probes in comparison to

826
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,930
other countries in the world you can see

827
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,020
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is taking from the official</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">site of ripe Atlas and the country with</font>

829
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:42,140
more probes has is Brazil a giant

830
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:45,380
country with only 50 56 probes and and

831
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:47,930
the line down<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very pale</font>

832
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,970
blue color the meaning that the

00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:52,930
percentage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of probes covered by that</font>

834
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:54,799
country is too high in<font color="#CCCCCC"> depth this case</font>

835
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:58,640
zero-point-six percent of the total

836
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,040
probes of ripe Atlas and and if we

837
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,390
compare with the next with the rest of

838
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world we can see for example in the</font>

United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Germany their whole</font>

840
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,440
they're both colored with dark blue

841
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:13,580
meaning they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a high percentage of</font>

probes being available for<font color="#E5E5E5"> measurements</font>

843
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,020
and we can see their niche in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Latin</font>

844
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">American curry is either pale blue which</font>

845
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:23,060
means a very low percentage or yellow

846
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:28,580
which means no information or no active

847
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:31,720
probes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we did to go over come</font>

848
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:34,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">these problems is a checker it has a</font>

measuring network software<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a with</font>

with software probes called probe<font color="#E5E5E5"> API</font>

851
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:42,080
with which through an API we can control

852
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:45,800
measurement probes and gather results

853
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:48,770
and to stuff that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up a level</font>

854
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:51,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">with other measurements and since their</font>

855
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:53,150
software probes they're easily to spread

856
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,799
and to install<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're not a</font>

00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,560
hardware that people have has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

858
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,570
home<font color="#CCCCCC"> and solve themselves and and</font>

859
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:03,049
they're running in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows computers</font>

860
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:05,150
real users computers so they have the

861
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:08,930
advantage of easy deployment but also

862
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:11,090
that isn't a disadvantage of a they are

863
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:13,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">very volatile they appear disappear all</font>

864
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:15,770
the time so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of them so we</font>

865
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:17,840
need lots of them to be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

866
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:21,680
reliable measurements and don't work

867
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:24,380
using synthetic traffic so we can see in

868
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,250
this graph a little comparison about a

869
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,570
plus and pro API<font color="#CCCCCC"> Atlas is the leela</font>

users but not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them are very well</font>

876
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:52,730
covered by either by not atlas or<font color="#CCCCCC"> api</font>

877
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:56,750
for example if we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top asn we</font>

878
00:46:52,730 --> 00:47:00,860
have 46 probes of in that ESN from at

879
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:04,370
last and 886 active at that moment when

880
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:08,060
we took the screenshot by<font color="#CCCCCC"> pro api so it</font>

881
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:10,160
can show this can shows us how we can

882
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">overcome these measurement problems with</font>

883
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:16,210
some hot software probes and what we did

884
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:20,689
in this region using this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

885
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:23,330
measurement method next one like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

886
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">before they are highly volatile that's</font>

887
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:27,830
why we require high number of probes

888
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:30,049
than normal to make reliable

889
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:32,420
measurements because because they appear

890
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:34,340
and disappear as users normal users you

891
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:37,760
open and close their laptops or

892
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:39,920
computers and monitoring from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users</font>

893
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,620
perspective yes lets us detect problems

894
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,650
that otherwise aren't really easy to see

895
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:47,299
because of the vantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> point problem in</font>

896
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:49,610
measuring networks that depending from

897
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,810
when you where you're measuring from you

898
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,330
will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

899
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:57,350
happening or not like in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the set in the</font>

900
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:59,000
next in this case we can see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

901
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:01,279
monitoring from inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network from</font>

902
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the center from the data centers of room</font>

903
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,350
servers or whatever we can monitor a

904
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:08,150
website which will tell us that it's

905
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:11,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay totally okay or from other users</font>

906
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:13,400
even it will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but if the an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

907
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:15,980
has connectivity problems or it has an

908
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,600
outage then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only way to detect that</font>

909
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:22,850
is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that perspective and that's one</font>

910
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,730
advantage i<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to show you from using</font>

911
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:27,740
this which can be of course it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

912
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:29,960
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> or worse than other measurements</font>

913
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">its complementary because it has its own</font>

914
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">advantages and disadvantages so we were</font>

915
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:39,170
going now to the experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself we</font>

916
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:42,140
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> sending between probes and and in</font>

21 countries the geolocation information

921
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:57,440
was taken from Mozilla and<font color="#E5E5E5"> max mine</font>

922
00:48:52,220 --> 00:49:00,439
databases yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the each measurement</font>

923
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,410
were like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten things so to say and we</font>

924
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:06,170
took the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of them to make to</font>

925
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:08,259
calculate our results based on the best

926
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:12,050
available connectivity the round trip

927
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:15,380
times and after getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results we</font>

928
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:18,340
group the countries like just observing

929
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:21,130
the results like clusters emerged very

930
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:25,820
there were very evidence to the eye and

931
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:29,590
and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say after grouping the</font>

932
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:33,080
countries we were able to define

933
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:34,970
connectivity of them using these three

934
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,340
measurements like the number of clusters

935
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:39,020
found how these countries how these

936
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:42,230
clusters relate to each other in terms

937
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:44,300
of connectivity how did the latency in

938
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:46,430
between the countries in this cluster is

939
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:51,320
or outside the cluster how the

940
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:53,210
connectivities so we have here to the up

941
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the upper side in the left we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

942
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:58,460
the graph we built and to the right the

943
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:01,580
map corresponding to go to the graph for

944
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:05,030
example if we take the cluster number

945
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:07,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">three argentina brazil paraguay and or</font>

946
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:09,680
why we can see that that cluster

947
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,120
internally like<font color="#E5E5E5"> between Argentina and</font>

948
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,419
all those countries they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very</font>

949
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:17,630
good connectivity 143 milliseconds

950
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:20,630
average and but to the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

951
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:22,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">cluster like going to other countries we</font>

952
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:26,930
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems not a problem but higher</font>

953
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:29,750
latency times or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> count the cluster</font>

954
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:34,730
number two which is Chile Bolivia and

955
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:36,560
Peru they have really not to encoding

956
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:38,360
compared to the other clusters<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

957
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:41,150
internal connectivity or external

958
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,730
connectivity isn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

959
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:46,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not very well connected to the</font>

960
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:51,440
region in that aspect and it will

961
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:53,600
observe cluster<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 and number one we can</font>

962
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,550
find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> between them they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have very</font>

963
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,799
good connectivity in their boundaries

964
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">are very</font>

965
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">evident in that sense we can also</font>

966
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,840
consider in one big cluster but at the

967
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,560
same time they have some some

968
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:07,750
differences let us differentiate them so

969
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,400
to the rest of the region they have to

970
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,190
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher times but between those two</font>

971
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:15,100
the between<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero and one they have only</font>

972
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:17,860
157<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue seconds latency in average so</font>

973
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:20,589
those are fairly interesting conclusions

974
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:25,630
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you can say to how the region</font>

975
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:28,420
is behaving in terms of latency and yeah

976
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:33,880
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a similar simple explanation of</font>

977
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:38,740
them of the graph and the I think I'll

978
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:40,060
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that already yes so I already</font>

979
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">told you these about the results of</font>

980
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:44,670
class number two's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> week in</font>

981
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:47,529
itself it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really connect between</font>

982
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:49,210
even internally or externally maybe only

983
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:51,010
inside the country's the connectivity is

984
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:53,230
good but between those countries Chile

985
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:57,010
Peru and Bolivia<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connectivity isn't</font>

986
00:51:53,230 --> 00:52:00,460
very good like I told<font color="#CCCCCC"> you also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

987
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:04,030
cluster<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has very internal cluster</font>

988
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:06,250
about lighting values but outside the

989
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:07,780
cluster it isn't very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

990
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,820
country between them they are very well

991
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,700
connected but to the rest it isn't very

992
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:16,450
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> told you before clusters</font>

993
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:19,569
0<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 1 can you go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to two slides</font>

994
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:23,049
yeah 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 1 are very well connected</font>

995
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:25,300
between them it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear cluster</font>

996
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:27,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that sense but to the rest of the</font>

997
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:33,690
countries they have liar a higher

998
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:38,140
latency values and yes go back three XS

999
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:41,890
so we followed the same procedure to

1000
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:44,710
detect bad connectivity or so to say we

1001
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:46,450
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same value of round 3 but we use</font>

1002
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:50,590
the inverse to construct<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same graph</font>

1003
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:53,549
and so it's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the we weren't</font>

1004
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:56,680
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the worst results but</font>

1005
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:58,000
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a comparing the least good</font>

1006
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,279
of them like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that where we're always</font>

1007
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,010
taking the best ICMP measurements and

1008
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,620
then we took the inverse of that and we

1009
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:08,680
can construct the graph based on the

1010
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:10,180
least good results<font color="#CCCCCC"> so um web</font>

1011
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,540
connectivity was

1012
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:15,460
detected in between Argentina and Chile

1013
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:19,509
which is surprising in some sense

1014
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:21,850
because they have a very big frontier

1015
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:23,920
very large but at the same time if you

1016
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:26,200
think you're geographically between

1017
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,910
Argentina and Chile others there's the

1018
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:31,660
end is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> between and it's not as easy</font>

1019
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:34,149
to lay a cable between the going through

1020
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:36,549
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> and s which are very very big</font>

1021
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:37,990
mountains Colombian Venezuela they don't

1022
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:42,640
have a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good connectivity between</font>

1023
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:44,319
them and Brazil and Peru mostly it's

1024
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:49,330
because normally that they're preferring

1025
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:51,160
we think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our key SE cables are</font>

1026
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:52,990
being preferred to connect on land

1027
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,810
cables and probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

1028
00:53:52,990 --> 00:54:00,250
geography of the region isn't really

1029
00:53:55,810 --> 00:54:02,440
that's favorable for laying cables<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1030
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:04,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why we think that ocean</font>

1031
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,760
cables are being used and that results

1032
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:10,810
sometimes in very long trips for things

1033
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:13,450
that could have been lot shorter next

1034
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:15,460
one please so yeah we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to the</font>

1035
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:19,080
end just three open questions we have

1036
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:22,890
after after<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this little experiment</font>

1037
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:25,420
it's there we can we summarize is

1038
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody have an idea if we can summarize</font>

1039
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:32,080
this indexes per country or per cluster

1040
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:34,420
so we can in one number we can compare

1041
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:37,360
them like how good it is internally

1042
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:40,690
externally or between them is there any

1043
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:43,540
funny idea to get to that point maybe

1044
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:45,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">our their physical connections that in</font>

1045
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,529
those countries are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really being</font>

1046
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,720
fully used and there's like

1047
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:53,140
infrastructure that's being misused or

1048
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:57,220
underused or maybe our measurements are

1049
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:58,629
escaping some links just relieved<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1050
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,790
with all those questions there's

1051
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:02,680
sometimes technically not too<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

1052
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:04,900
answer but i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to present them</font>

1053
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,799
to you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1054
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,800
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>

1055
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:17,598
take a Christian Christian yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kristin</font>

1056
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:23,900
some quite any question from<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience oh</font>

1057
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:26,099
that's a lot Oh drew taylor from comcast

1058
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:29,910
thanks for his<font color="#CCCCCC"> presentations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

1059
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:31,440
to see so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think one of the big selling</font>

1060
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:34,440
points behind right<font color="#CCCCCC"> ballast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

1061
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,780
hardware is very consistent so as the

1062
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,599
software stack yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm kind of</font>

1063
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:45,960
curious have you done any studies to see

1064
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:48,480
how that's affecting your data um no not

1065
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,390
really up to now we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> concentrated</font>

1066
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,210
in expanding the network and making this

1067
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:56,308
the probes as functional as possible but

1068
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:59,040
quality assurance and measurements is of

1069
00:55:56,309 --> 00:56:01,559
course is a an important task we have to

1070
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,619
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> into account but of course the</font>

1071
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:07,290
tower running the probes is very diverse

1072
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">depending on everybody's computers or</font>

1073
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:12,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows installation how healthy is the</font>

1074
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,720
installations of so yes it's it's very

1075
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:18,750
dependent on that yeah you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1076
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,220
thanks well Geronimo from Florida

1077
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,380
International University I have two

1078
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:24,990
questions the first one have you

1079
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:26,880
considered testing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connective</font>

1080
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:28,589
the last mile connectivity for example

1081
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,530
to understand if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> users using a</font>

1082
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:33,390
Wi-Fi that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily add 20</font>

1083
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:37,230
milliseconds or using wired connectivity

1084
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:39,720
and the second one it would be good to

1085
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:41,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> closer in US and other you</font>

1086
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">monitoring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Latin America but it looks</font>

1087
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:46,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">like at least between Brazil Chile and</font>

1088
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:49,349
Argentina all of the traffic

1089
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:52,740
intracluster is going through us because

1090
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:54,480
143<font color="#E5E5E5"> milliseconds a lot yes if yeah I</font>

1091
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:57,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's a lot going through Miami</font>

1092
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,240
or something I and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's yea big yeah</font>

1093
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:01,859
it's a bit stupid fruit from the sense

1094
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,899
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's how things are being done now</font>

1095
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:06,089
what was the first question again about

1096
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,280
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> mile for example if you have to</font>

1097
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:10,920
users pinging between them each one of

1098
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:14,040
the each users<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to a Wi-Fi you</font>

1099
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:17,790
have easily 40 milliseconds just for the

1100
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:19,500
last mile yes yes so the protest is the

1101
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:22,190
connectivity to the first to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

1102
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,910
router to understand if it's it's a

1103
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:26,369
Wi-Fi wireless

1104
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:28,828
we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that that part we are</font>

1105
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:31,230
assuming like the users point of view no

1106
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:32,670
matter what what is between<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and the</font>

1107
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:35,069
server because there may be more than

1108
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:37,319
one Wi-Fi in between there there's an

1109
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:39,569
undetermined number of things between

1110
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:42,869
them so until now we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that</font>

1111
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:45,750
part but yeah it sounds very interesting

1112
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:49,920
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do of course like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get that</font>

1113
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the of the charts thank you</font>

1114
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:57,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you I usually from GPRS my</font>

1115
00:57:54,660 --> 00:58:00,538
question is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the software probe how</font>

1116
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:04,589
did you deploy your software probe in

1117
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:08,280
lucky area and my another question is is

1118
00:58:04,589 --> 00:58:11,759
it available to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public if you have</font>

1119
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:16,619
any website I track you know if you have

1120
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:19,289
a if you have any website about software

1121
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:21,329
probe then I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to know yes yes we</font>

1122
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:25,319
have you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the speed</font>

1123
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:28,220
checker XYZ and you can download your

1124
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:30,990
own profits at<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed checking software</font>

1125
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:32,788
which users download and most of the

1126
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:35,759
time the software doesn't really do much

1127
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:39,180
then check your dsl speed and at the

1128
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,940
same time the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available to</font>

1129
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:43,140
us as a probe to to make measurements

1130
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,480
most of the time the software isn't

1131
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:49,470
doing anything but when it receives a

1132
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:52,859
measurement I command it will measure

1133
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:55,709
very shortly and we deploy that way we

1134
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:58,020
offer the users<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure the dsl</font>

1135
00:58:55,710 --> 00:59:00,059
connectivity and in exchange their make

1136
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:05,990
them their computers available to our

users that are running your software so

1152
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:45,240
if I'm tomorrow i will run your software

01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:11,100
research to use our platform for free

1162
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:14,070
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sense but like the users of</font>

1163
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:16,140
the present selves don't have a direct

1164
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:19,770
exchange of credits like like you

1165
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:22,230
described mostly you can you can you can

1166
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:24,540
make an account with us for free and use

1167
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:28,020
the to a certain point the measurement

1168
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:30,270
system but such a system as you say we

1169
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:32,160
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented that it's hard but</font>

1170
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:34,680
is it possible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> customize these</font>

1171
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:36,750
measure measurements or it is only

1172
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:39,149
opportunity to make something request or

1173
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:42,540
something like that something<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat</font>

1174
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:44,510
something yes that we have every probe

1175
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:48,150
has very different measurement methods

1176
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:51,060
we can make page load measurements like

1177
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:54,240
we're using a real instance of Explorer

1178
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:56,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">or Chrome the the probe response an</font>

1179
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:00,240
instance loads the page and it kills

1180
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:03,780
itself then and yeah we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

1181
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,129
single objects or thing and in there are

1182
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:07,860
customizable innocence that they are

1183
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:11,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">available either as a ready product we</font>

1184
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:13,050
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with a GUI or as I as an API</font>

1185
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,450
that one day one they used in this in

1186
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:18,210
latnok to make this measurement which

1187
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:21,299
they as an API you can code it's

1188
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:24,780
available through mush mush<font color="#E5E5E5"> shape so you</font>

1189
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:28,290
can use the code in java and PHP or you

1190
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:31,920
can interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the API using almost</font>

1191
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:34,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">any popular language</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you I</font>

1192
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,020
think to be very good if you will take

1193
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:39,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">ripe as an example it also will provide</font>

1194
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:42,900
your users something in exchange thank

1195
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:46,890
you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you yes thank you yeah I'm</font>

1196
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:49,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">where to I saw Katie FL so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

1197
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:52,288
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are aware but in Brazil dig deep</font>

1198
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:55,709
what the art is having a project to

1199
01:01:52,289 --> 01:01:58,769
perform measurements<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> project is</font>

1200
01:01:55,709 --> 01:02:01,348
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> cnet dar so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is basically</font>

1201
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:04,468
do essentially the same but using the

1202
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:05,999
end user to start application and

1203
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:10,739
perform measurements from the desktop

1204
01:02:05,999 --> 01:02:12,930
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pie or whatever so maybe a as a</font>

1205
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:15,749
suggestion maybe would be nice you to

1206
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:18,328
get this this data I think it's open to

1207
01:02:15,749 --> 01:02:20,450
the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> is much better to use this</font>

1208
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:24,539
data then use the right probes and

1209
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:27,239
another comment is that some answer to

1210
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:29,190
their questions input did think there's

1211
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:31,650
there are some operators in Latin

1212
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:33,209
America I remember from<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter Nexus they</font>

1213
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:36,059
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct connection from Brazil to</font>

1214
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:38,729
Colombia and I remember another one that

1215
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:41,729
which has connection from San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Paulo to</font>

1216
01:02:38,729 --> 01:02:44,519
Santiago passing through Argentina so

1217
01:02:41,729 --> 01:02:48,239
maybe it wasn't included to your study

1218
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:51,689
so you could consider this working thank

1219
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:54,420
you ya javani am the next speaker

1220
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:57,029
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for SI the end so you did</font>

1221
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:59,369
your measurements using ICMP right very

1222
01:02:57,029 --> 01:03:01,380
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes there's a lot of criticism in</font>

1223
01:02:59,369 --> 01:03:03,690
regards to i7 b because it's heavily

1224
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:06,479
shaped sometimes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lower key last</font>

1225
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:08,849
yes uh you know this criticism problem

1226
01:03:06,479 --> 01:03:11,218
so have you considered using other

1227
01:03:08,849 --> 01:03:14,910
protocols instead and compare the

1228
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:17,640
results um like personally and

1229
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:19,199
internally<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the company not this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

1230
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,819
study done by lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick and we're</font>

1231
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,650
presenting this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a cooperation they</font>

1232
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:25,049
had their own they made an over their

1233
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:27,390
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision of using ICMP but normally</font>

1234
01:03:25,049 --> 01:03:29,099
we use time to first byte using HTTP

1235
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:31,739
directly because it's the protocol we're

1236
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:34,709
using so normally with we measure either

1237
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:36,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">I won by its file downloading it just</font>

1238
01:03:34,709 --> 01:03:38,430
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or just we measure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it</font>

1239
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:40,259
take to download the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd and</font>

1240
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:45,890
that's mostly equivalent to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmp but</font>

1241
01:03:40,259 --> 01:03:45,890
using the HTTP stack yes thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font>

1242
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:52,709
last one please<font color="#CCCCCC"> pet line it Huawei I</font>

1243
01:03:50,249 --> 01:03:55,769
work with ripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> NCC and working on the</font>

1244
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:58,529
iPad last project so it's good the work

1245
01:03:55,769 --> 01:04:00,629
that you did but if you guys you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in</font>

1246
01:03:58,529 --> 01:04:02,940
Latin America are interested in more

1247
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,660
probes I'm sure they're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

1248
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,819
more pro

1249
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:07,288
you know if you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> contacts i'm sure</font>

1250
01:04:05,819 --> 01:04:09,240
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> contacts but if you do need</font>

1251
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:11,640
more context please feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check</font>

1252
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:14,490
with me please let me complete that one

1253
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:16,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">I am actually working off with ripe</font>

1254
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:18,058
Atlas as ambassador for Brazilian

1255
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:26,220
regions so if you live in South American

1256
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:28,380
you want probes I have them I also I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1257
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:30,808
do agree that a ripe ripe Atlas also

1258
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,670
have a worldwide coverage but it's nice

1259
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:34,650
to always have at diversity to

1260
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,809
measurement infrastructure even more

1261
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,549
when it goes to developing regions or

1262
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:39,900
poorer regions of the country of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1263
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:42,359
world where it's difficult to get the

1264
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:45,720
right ship to ship<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you I'd like just</font>

1265
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:48,900
to complete the question session with

1266
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:52,319
one question is your measurement running

1267
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">over time or you do it once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stop or</font>

1268
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:57,390
is it running for for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example I year</font>

1269
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:59,970
already it was done for a year and it

1270
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:02,700
was programmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure in regular</font>

1271
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:05,879
intervals as how you want be using the

1272
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:08,089
any any any time controlling algorithm

1273
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:10,289
you want if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iata and</font>

1274
01:05:08,089 --> 01:05:13,140
yeah it's not continuous monitoring is

1275
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:16,049
normally one test and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can repeat it</font>

1276
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:18,450
as much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want ok so like suggest</font>

1277
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:22,259
perhaps for a talk for an NMR<font color="#CCCCCC"> G next</font>

1278
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:24,180
year if you can see the impacts of

1279
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,829
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> and political decisions that are</font>

1280
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:28,049
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> South America I'm from South</font>

1281
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:30,510
America so I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are these</font>

1282
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:32,369
problems going on there quite often if

1283
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:34,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see from your measurement</font>

1284
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:37,349
framework the impacts that it have on it

1285
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:38,848
has on the connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people it's</font>

1286
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:41,270
always nice so we see papers being

1287
01:05:38,849 --> 01:05:43,680
published about Cuba about China about

1288
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:45,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">other places where we have one ripe</font>

1289
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:48,450
Atlas<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write pathless but they can</font>

1290
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:50,788
already see some nice characteristics

1291
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:52,770
there so that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be awesome movie</font>

1292
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:55,970
yeah Thank you Thank You Christian again

1293
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:55,970
let's everybody

1294
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:05,910
our next Victor speaker is Giovanni Mora

1295
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:20,520
Mora from SI quien laps do you need my

1296
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:52,470
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany oh yeah yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1297
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">not my computer disease Christian yes</font>

1298
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:56,270
kids say there's a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1299
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,270
today

1300
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:40,359
yeah so I figure can start just give you

1301
01:07:38,109 --> 01:07:42,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">some context so the working on represent</font>

1302
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:46,929
here is not say letter purely academic

1303
01:07:42,869 --> 01:07:49,089
this is a paper we publish up the AP WG

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> jeunesse traffic and this paper</font>

1311
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:09,178
shows a couple of applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1312
01:08:06,819 --> 01:08:13,329
what things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do quickly but that</font>

1313
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:16,690
should go next one um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you some</font>

1314
01:08:13,329 --> 01:08:18,759
context here what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do if you I</font>

1315
01:08:16,689 --> 01:08:20,318
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many how many people here</font>

1316
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:22,149
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have a big data problem</font>

1317
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:23,889
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume of data that's like you have</font>

1318
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:25,358
shown Eliza's fangs can you raise our

1319
01:08:23,889 --> 01:08:27,659
hands with those big data analysis here

1320
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:31,659
and big data is very vague but yeah

1321
01:08:27,658 --> 01:08:33,698
there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so I mean if you</font>

1322
01:08:31,658 --> 01:08:35,589
have a terabytes of data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> specially</font>

1323
01:08:33,698 --> 01:08:37,629
pcap files have generalizes thing you

1324
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:40,118
know how but a nightmare is or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font>

1325
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:41,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to do that um you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

1326
01:08:40,118 --> 01:08:44,078
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> inefficient in a cheap way so</font>

1327
01:08:41,979 --> 01:08:46,448
the engineers are going to company that

1328
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:48,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work for they start to use and stuff</font>

1329
01:08:46,448 --> 01:08:51,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">from other disciplines like the data</font>

1330
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:52,149
engineering people to optimize that then

1331
01:08:51,038 --> 01:08:54,639
bring that to that next working

1332
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:56,500
community and they call this in product

1333
01:08:54,639 --> 01:08:57,759
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a product that's build on open</font>

1334
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,828
source code i'm going to give the

1335
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:03,368
details<font color="#E5E5E5"> later one and what it does on</font>

1336
01:08:59,828 --> 01:09:06,328
top of that it is designed to ingest DNS

1337
01:09:03,368 --> 01:09:09,429
traffic we work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company that does</font>

1338
01:09:06,328 --> 01:09:10,509
dining out the top level domain the

1339
01:09:09,429 --> 01:09:12,670
netherlands so we collect of the

1340
01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:14,319
authoritative traffic and a store in our

1341
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:17,408
cluster for analysis for research

1342
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:19,000
purposes uh so a couple things you can

1343
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:20,528
do you can put on a single table if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1344
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,880
have this terabytes of data set since

1345
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:22,170
things

1346
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,330
you don't scare so you need something

1347
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:25,830
that will I scales and once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1348
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:27,448
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just two more hari on that</font>

1349
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:32,278
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fro more hard when you know you keep</font>

1350
01:09:27,448 --> 01:09:33,479
the speed so that's next lifeless<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and</font>

1351
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:36,569
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty much what they've done</font>

1352
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:37,799
that since we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need is a response type</font>

1353
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:42,330
interactive times they build his own

1354
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:45,719
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> x1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please so entrada is basically</font>

1355
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:47,908
an optimized for<font color="#CCCCCC"> matta in a platform for</font>

1356
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:49,589
performing data analysis on track

1357
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:51,899
internet trafficking out<font color="#CCCCCC"> roland also</font>

1358
01:09:49,589 --> 01:09:55,290
uses some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detector but not and</font>

1359
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:58,280
try to buy like Hadoop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Impala and</font>

1360
01:09:55,290 --> 01:10:01,139
the same file on his project there<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

1361
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:03,330
the thing is it can analyze the

1362
01:10:01,139 --> 01:10:05,280
equivalent of 50 terabytes of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcap data</font>

1363
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:08,820
in a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> four node cluster is a tiny</font>

1364
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,380
cluster and for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you need to</font>

1365
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:12,150
know what is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it in six</font>

1366
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:14,940
packets you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a network on a</font>

1367
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:16,739
vibratory if for example last year if

1368
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,940
you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> repeat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> caps and</font>

1369
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:19,468
process all the Sphinx<font color="#E5E5E5"> it do discounts</font>

1370
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:21,000
or the average packet size are going to

1371
01:10:19,469 --> 01:10:22,350
take forever but if you have stuff like

1372
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,449
that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be real quick like a</font>

1373
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:29,909
question of minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or seconds and</font>

1374
01:10:26,449 --> 01:10:32,339
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with so in try to buy</font>

1375
01:10:29,909 --> 01:10:35,159
us down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a DP caps converting that</font>

1376
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:37,530
thing to an optimized for map which is

1377
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:40,230
park a park is implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apache</font>

1379
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:45,299
dremel file system and which is

1380
01:10:42,929 --> 01:10:47,969
optimized callenders file format in

1381
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:49,260
short if you need to like do a radio Mir

1382
01:10:47,969 --> 01:10:51,020
file if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to just figure it out</font>

1383
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:53,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the packet size for all your files</font>

1384
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:55,380
for our your packet to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this internet</font>

1385
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:57,120
work you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually to read the</font>

1386
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:59,040
entire file you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to read the</font>

1387
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,980
entire column they're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in so</font>

1388
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,449
it saves a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you the</font>

1392
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,389
allows you to send sick of co2 analyzer

1393

pique pique pique pique<font color="#CCCCCC"> rivlin files so</font>

1394
01:11:12,389 --> 01:11:18,239
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy for anyone who want to do</font>

1395
01:11:14,639 --> 01:11:19,620
a data analysis fast as well yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1396
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,239
one please and the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

1397
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:23,449
in the confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like rapid all</font>

1398
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:25,530
those things together and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1399
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:28,080
implemented a data model to incorporate

DNS traffic and to a constant in<font color="#CCCCCC"> chaste</font>

1403
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:37,320
over two years now have liked videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1404
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:40,170
cures<font color="#CCCCCC"> there 21</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terabytes of data and</font>

1405
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:41,639
it's already converted and it captured a

1406
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:45,330
date they get it from our miam service

1407
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:47,130
that's it next one please do get a paper

1408

i'm not mistaken they figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font>

1438
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:56,100
domains that they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> for fishing</font>

1439
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:57,750
typically on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very first days or</font>

1440
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:59,970
hours after registrations they have a

1441
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:02,010
peek on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of queries that they</font>

1442
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:06,570
get and you'll deserve the same for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1443
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:08,670
now so for example the red the figure on

1444
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:11,730
the right over there it has an average

1445
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:13,380
number of 150 curious or 200 these are

1446
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:15,389
domains that were provided by netcraft

1447
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,650
that were found in fishing on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dianella</font>

1448
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:18,239
zone so we look at today our

1449
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:19,650
authoritative servers and you see hey

1450
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:22,080
how many queries we'd seen for those

1451
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:23,489
particular domains after the

1452
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,370
registration and you see there is a pic

1453
01:13:23,489 --> 01:13:28,139
and after 10 days it really dies down

1454
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:29,820
while the normal regular domains you

1455
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:31,380
have an average<font color="#E5E5E5"> of five queries a day on</font>

1456
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:33,929
the first day is a tree or whatever so

1457
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:35,190
there's a clear distinct pattern Nick

1458
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:37,140
feemster<font color="#E5E5E5"> found stuff and publish</font>

1459
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:39,239
whatever we kind of went a step further

1460
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:41,219
when you run a different algorithm to

1461
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:43,559
classify that k-means on top of that and

1462
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:46,170
had a paper and on this particular thing

1463
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,679
so next slide please and what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

1464
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:48,479
again

1465
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:50,699
every day<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domains</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that were</font>

1466
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,920
added<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our data nodes on they were</font>

1467
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:55,199
registered we'll look for a couple

1468
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">features the number of queries the</font>

1469
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,739
number of countries resolvers that are

1470
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:01,018
creating that thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first day we</font>

1471
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:03,049
run k-means on top of that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> classify</font>

1472
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:06,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">to to cluster suspicious and normal</font>

1473
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:09,239
normal and once you get a suspicious one

1474
01:14:06,449 --> 01:14:10,289
we notify our registrar's and red stars

1475
01:14:09,239 --> 01:14:12,749
are the confidence actually do the

1476
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:14,099
registration for us it's a pilot's is in

1477
01:14:12,749 --> 01:14:16,019
a pilot stage right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there's a couple</font>

1478
01:14:14,099 --> 01:14:17,939
false positives of course because you're

1479
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:19,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify fishing only from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1480
01:14:17,939 --> 01:14:23,670
query pattern of the domains as like

1481
01:14:19,979 --> 01:14:26,159
it's because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fisher's usually they</font>

1482
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:28,260
rely upon spam to notify their domains

1483
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:30,530
in the first days so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually have a huge</font>

1484
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:32,880
number of queries but any political

1485
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:34,920
motivated website also get this thing so

1486
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,039
we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> working to improve this but it's</font>

1487
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,479
it's working on a kind of status a

1488
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:42,809
prototype phase right now next one

1489
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:45,389
please this is a project of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marco who's</font>

1490
01:14:42,809 --> 01:14:47,010
sitting right over here I guess yeah but

1491
01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:48,329
my detection<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they they there's a</font>

1492
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:49,889
particular button that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1493
01:14:48,329 --> 01:14:52,079
talk much about it because if you are

1494
01:14:49,889 --> 01:14:54,179
the signature for this Batman and who

1495
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:56,489
killed attack that one looking our<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

1496
01:14:54,179 --> 01:14:58,949
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is seeing there's a couple</font>

1497
01:14:56,489 --> 01:15:01,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a think from a mistake and those are</font>

1498
01:14:58,949 --> 01:15:02,969
CNC channels domains<font color="#CCCCCC"> they use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1499
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:06,269
kind of you know monitor the traffic to

1500
01:15:02,969 --> 01:15:07,829
them and once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this thing we we</font>

1501
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:10,349
also use entrada that's a better form

1502
01:15:07,829 --> 01:15:13,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">channelized that is the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we</font>

1503
01:15:10,349 --> 01:15:15,059
notify what we call it sedition in each

initiative which is called abuse

1505

addresses for those autonomous systems

1511
01:15:26,999 --> 01:15:32,059
so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clean up the network's next</font>

1512
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:34,229
one please just worship to start cases

1513
01:15:32,059 --> 01:15:35,610
and this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number to see the time</font>

1518
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:47,340
that the way the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS works once we see a</font>

the resolver of the client on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

1522
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:57,090
network so they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do a</font>

1523
01:15:53,729 --> 01:15:58,600
little more investigation on that next

1524
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:01,320
one please

1525
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:04,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're there this two-hour season</font>

1526
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:07,360
that standardized different things

1527
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:09,340
policy and pre-made security this try to

1528
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:11,170
improve inmate security in a way to

1529
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:12,970
define who can send email for a

1530
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:15,700
particular domain and what is the policy

1531
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:17,770
was you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail from a different IP</font>

1532
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,929
address for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1533
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:22,570
measure their that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> adoption of that</font>

1534
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:24,010
using simply SQL queries in our platform

1535
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:26,200
because we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a traffic so you're just</font>

1536
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:29,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">one sicko run over the days and you see</font>

1537
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:30,550
like how this thing is growing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a next</font>

1538
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">one please so we have a couple results</font>

1539
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:34,690
here and it as a percentage like there's

1540
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,830
a lot of percentage of adoption in<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

1541
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,480
and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course this is the cloud</font>

1542
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:40,030
providers means<font color="#CCCCCC"> chimayo most of people</font>

1543
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:42,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">use gmail so yeah in a cloud providers</font>

1544
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:43,900
that's why you see this is fixing right

1545
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:49,900
have cloud we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the Spanx once the</font>

1546
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:51,309
adult that's it next one please<font color="#E5E5E5"> do or it</font>

1547
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:53,170
is our tunnel systems where they're

1548
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:56,830
located all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it can be</font>

1549
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:59,470
easily be done as well next one yeah so

1550
01:16:56,830 --> 01:17:01,420
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did you showcase a cup of</font>

1551
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:02,500
case studies which you can do so if you

1552
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:06,310
have a big data problem you should

1553
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:07,510
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself to use the tools that</font>

01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:26,050
the finger would develop it's all on the

and contribute as well next one place

1564
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:33,940
yeah you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are constantly a you</font>

01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:39,660
yeah and be happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take any questions</font>

01:17:57,019 --> 01:18:02,659
questions well one you just answered

1571
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:04,419
it's all open source yeah yeah I mean

1572
01:18:02,659 --> 01:18:07,308
that the whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open source and</font>

1573
01:18:04,419 --> 01:18:09,439
the changes we did the things we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1574
01:18:07,309 --> 01:18:13,130
also consortium and also about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

1575
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:15,289
how much of it also you can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24</font>

1576
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:18,260
for example for open access<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1577
01:18:15,289 --> 01:18:20,090
researchers or even curiosity yet so

1578
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,919
there's there's a we have a privacy

1579
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:23,449
policy that defines what you can share

1580
01:18:21,919 --> 01:18:26,209
what it cannot and how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use the</font>

1581
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:29,839
data we provide aggregated data on our

1582
01:18:26,209 --> 01:18:31,369
stats<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh provided to</font>

1583
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,530
research a fix that by that its case by

1584
01:18:31,369 --> 01:18:35,209
case we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that yet because</font>

1585
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:36,978
it's pretty strict no they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1586
01:18:35,209 --> 01:18:39,229
classified a personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> ended file</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

1587
01:18:36,979 --> 01:18:41,300
so its case by<font color="#E5E5E5"> kid I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think if you have</font>

1588
01:18:39,229 --> 01:18:47,709
an idea just contact us a nice you can

1589
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:50,840
do and on your malicious domain research

1590
01:18:47,709 --> 01:18:53,019
you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you would you take only</font>

1591
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:55,789
the new domains registered per day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1592
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:57,530
then you classify them as malicious or

1593
01:18:55,789 --> 01:18:59,809
not do you have any idea or can you

1594
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:02,360
close an idea of the relation the ratio

1595
01:18:59,809 --> 01:19:04,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">between register domains per day and how</font>

1596
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:06,398
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are malicious up so I</font>

1597
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:09,289
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends a lot on the day and</font>

1598
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:11,030
per day usually see like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1015 domains on</font>

1599
01:19:09,289 --> 01:19:14,090
average and there's a bunch of false

1600
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:15,590
some false positives to and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think also</font>

1601
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:18,229
depends will definition of malicious

1602
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:20,539
than 50 malicious suspicious that

1603
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:22,340
suspicious and let's say I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1604
01:19:20,539 --> 01:19:23,898
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day how many going to be</font>

1605
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:25,760
malicious but there's a different

1606
01:19:23,899 --> 01:19:28,459
definition definition of malicious this

1607
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:32,059
thing detects based on the volume of a

1608
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:34,159
curious so spam phishing is one case but

1609
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:36,499
there are cases that they create like

1610
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:38,299
you know websites and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sell and</font>

1611
01:19:36,499 --> 01:19:40,130
counterfeit products like shoes or

1612
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,899
pharmaceutical drugs so it's as

1613
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:43,369
malicious this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> illegal it's kind of</font>

1614
01:19:41,899 --> 01:19:48,590
gray area so does all of those things

1615
01:19:43,369 --> 01:19:54,079
too so it's yeah borderline yeah and one

1616
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:55,519
one last question for me is do you can

1617
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:56,040
you relate it similar to the question i

1618
01:19:55,519 --> 01:19:57,750
had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> chris</font>

1619
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:00,810
young as well can you relate the number

1620
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:02,760
of suspicious domain registration to

1621
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:05,490
certain events that go around the globe

1622
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:09,960
or mainly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Netherlands because i'd</font>

1623
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:11,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">say an example the the i don't know can</font>

1624
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:14,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">be even queen's day in the never me yeah</font>

1625
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:16,290
i mean we can see some stuff i mean we

1626
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:18,269
seen a cup of politically motivated

1627
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:21,390
websites after some terrorist attacks

1628
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:23,970
that he came up and they kind of spread

1629
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:25,140
like fire on<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter and of course to</font>

1630
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:26,880
see this thing's next day in aqueous

1631
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:30,900
patterns as well because they go insane

1632
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:33,780
so they can a domain is very popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1633
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:35,280
the first day Kim can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> for different</font>

1634
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:36,780
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> militias are not or like</font>

1635
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,630
political motivator or whatever so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1636
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:41,910
can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a sensor for that too and</font>

1637
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:43,800
so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're actually working extended</font>

1638
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:46,050
this this project to incorporate

1639
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,730
registration data to account for the

1640
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">likelihood of being like political</font>

1641
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:51,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">motive ated so rule out this kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1642
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:55,650
guys and you remain only those that are

1643
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually trying to be malicious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font>

1644
01:20:55,650 --> 01:21:03,809
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any more questions let's</font>

1645

<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunny again thank you for the</font>

1646
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:10,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">presentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then for the open source if</font>

1647
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:13,710
you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed the blue sheet yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">dunno</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where it is at this moment please</font>

1649
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:20,250
do so at the end when we when we close

1650
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:21,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring it here whoever has it</font>

yeah thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having attended</font>

1654
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:43,440
energy workshop as usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would like</font>

1655
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:45,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion on on on on the</font>

01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,589
event right and also on future events

1657
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:51,600
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example we originally started</font>

1658
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:55,250
several years ago that this kind of

1659
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:58,880
meeting was strictly on a flow based

1660
01:21:55,250 --> 01:22:01,650
measurement form network management and

1661
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:04,110
based on the feedback of the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1662
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:06,299
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> extended that from first full flow</font>

1663
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:08,190
based net flow based measurement to flow

1664
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,400
based measurement and this year we have

1665
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:11,500
extended<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to any</font>

1666
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:15,519
kind of measurement based network

1667
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:17,170
management so feel free to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give us your</font>

1668
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,230
feedback whether you like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction</font>

1669
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:23,159
whether you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have other other</font>

1670
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:27,820
topics in the next probably next year's

01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:29,710
instance of direction George now or send

1672

1673
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:37,179
fight<font color="#E5E5E5"> right which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is of course</font>

1674
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:39,520
appreciated anything as there will be

1675
01:22:37,179 --> 01:22:45,840
not an emoji joint event right maybe you

1676
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:48,219
can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and everyone just</font>

1677
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,110
commenting first on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> from inside so</font>

1678
01:22:48,219 --> 01:22:52,420
please join the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list and</font>

01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:55,030
interact on the mailing list and Ricky

1680
01:22:52,420 --> 01:23:00,580
if you wish on this measurement

1681
01:22:55,030 --> 01:23:03,070
monitoring a topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> of energy also you</font>

1682
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:06,070
used to have a combination of locating

1683
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:07,570
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF order network management or</font>

1684
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,460
rating conferences so you can express

1685
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:11,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">also your views if you think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1686
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,719
consistent and if you want to continue

1687
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:16,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">this way I will also encourage you to</font>

1688
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:20,409
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> try as a community on this topic</font>

1689
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:22,780
try to define what will be some research

1690
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:25,420
topics research areas and maybe document

1691
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:27,370
that with some internet draft so that we

1692
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:29,890
also show that as a working group as a

1693
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:33,159
research group there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity and</font>

1694
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:35,290
maybe also higher perspective to wear

1695
01:23:33,159 --> 01:23:37,960
this measurement and monitoring activity

1696
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:40,150
can can go not talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1697
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:43,270
somatization but as a research topic and

1698
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:45,699
also maybe try it in the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

1699
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:47,350
some interactions which there is this

1700
01:23:45,699 --> 01:23:50,919
map research group that has been

1701
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:52,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">recently created they're also looking at</font>

1702
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:54,310
measurement from a quite different

1703
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:56,409
perspective but I think there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a</font>

1704
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:59,080
community they're also going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1705
01:23:56,409 --> 01:24:01,809
scientific conferences so maybe the two

1706
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:04,540
activities can also be a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1707
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:07,630
interactions that can be a topic for

1708
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:10,780
another either an emoji or ma perché

1709
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:14,080
joint session and so what ramming

1710
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:16,719
mentioned there is a second energy joint

1711
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:18,760
meeting with NF v<font color="#CCCCCC"> RG and energy energy</font>

1712
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:21,040
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> friday morning so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

1713
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">morning session the topic is on the</font>

1714
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:25,180
managing virtualized and programmer

1715
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:26,980
network so we will have different kind

1716
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:30,040
of talks that are more oriented towards

1717
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:31,900
what are the challenges of managing the

1718
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:34,690
new type of environments with an avian

1719
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:37,330
sdn but also all these virtualization

1720
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:39,969
