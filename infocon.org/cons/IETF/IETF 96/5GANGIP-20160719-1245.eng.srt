texture presentation

38
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:28,180
so you got to connect through that then

39
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:34,839

48
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,780
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the team racing at the</font>

49
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,860
deutsche telekom chairs you can see for

50
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,690
communication networks and together<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

51
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,880
get advice and leading the fight cheat

52
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,850
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> germany and i was asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not to give a</font>

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,130
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduction about 45 g stop what</font>

54
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:16,720
all is and how it links to it already

55
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:19,180
ongoing activities here idea so um one

56
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,459
thing that we always tell people is 5 g

57
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,250
is different to other technology lat 43

58
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:27,010
good now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already know the use cases</font>

59
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,320
of my FG and we can already see whether

60
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,000
and the money would come from and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,250
the use cases what you can derive very

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,980
quickly are these technical requirements

63
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,720
right and i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people understood</font>

64
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,910
oh there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth like 10</font>

65
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,370
gigabit per second per user but what

66
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,329
they also he is this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> agency so</font>

67
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:49,359
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> vacancy and maybe many times in</font>

68
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:51,760
context of<font color="#E5E5E5"> webpages latency and Facebook</font>

69
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">and Google Amazon how they want and</font>

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,470
reduce the latency but this latency is

71
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,370
even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we if Olivo is one</font>

72
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:02,650
millisecond delay out of my two or three

73
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,840
we at the factory<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Germany always</font>

74
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,220
referred to one millisecond because what

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,980
we want to do is they only want to

76
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,500
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> is steer and cyber physical</font>

77
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,810
systems and when you want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

78
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:18,149
besides agency narrate your to need

79
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:20,918
security driver reliable the bad news is

80
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,780
when you think about these things have

81
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:26,380
to get 10 gigabit per second one

82
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,359
milliseconds each parameter<font color="#CCCCCC"> C is already</font>

83
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,280
difficult to achieve but you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

84
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,930
and at the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

85
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,690
what it's all about

86
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,610
and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are thinking about 5 g is</font>

87
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,889
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have to think about</font>

88
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,360
the air at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the face right what it's very</font>

89
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,690
important to the network of the cloud

90
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,000
and mainly this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5g because this one</font>

91
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,889
is just an add-on but the silicon is

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,259
also something that really in for

93
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,270
providing security<font color="#E5E5E5"> negatives and have to</font>

94
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,770
have something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast computing this</font>

95
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,770
is the four tracks that we have

96
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,948
identified in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 52 left Germany and I</font>

97
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,830
wouldn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivate a few of them so</font>

98
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:07,240
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about 5 g and you look at</font>

99
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:09,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">do into the context of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 25</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> G then what</font>

100
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,470
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really say is that everything</font>

101
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was before 5g was something</font>

102
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,009
connecting people<font color="#E5E5E5"> right remember the</font>

108
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 5g we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about five front of</font>

billion things that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to control</font>

110
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,150
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already different and</font>

111
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,740
controlling this is a week with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

115
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,039
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's clear but there's not the</font>

main thing and love to relieve the

117
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,229
treaty partner game so if you do that

118
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,630
and we too often talk about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech</font>

119
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:56,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">tile internet so in an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet that</font>

120
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,729
gets your feedback in a certain and time

121
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,190
and this is the one really second if you

122
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">know think about what is the the pink</font>

123
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,690
time nowadays if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 4gb or</font>

124
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,500
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 30 milliseconds but this</font>

125
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,539
is just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pink time on layer 2 so you</font>

126
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,190
involve the cloud you will see higher

127
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:14,199
values there what we think about is a

128
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">one millisecond end-to-end delay and</font>

129
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,940
where do you get right we talked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

130
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,370
lot of stimulation bodies above this IDF

131
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,380
is one of them I to prepare etsy and all

132
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,570
of them talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the higher and</font>

133
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,909
five teeth the first network that really

134
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:32,620
supports this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tech cart internet</font>

135
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:35,259
in the end and and if you talk to sorry

136
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,909
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> latency this is the picture I very</font>

137
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,259
light you see some gamers there they

138
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:40,810
always knew that late is it more

139
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:42,039
important than data right and the nice

140
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,289
thing is they also give you the

141
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,150
explanation how to get no latency you

142
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:47,580
just get it

143
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,280
opportunity is something that brings you

144
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,870
the latest unfortunately I<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot show</font>

145
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,549
you this video here is not starting on

146
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,590
the machine but it's something that we

147
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,540
build up some<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago it's just</font>

148
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,760
something like an oculus rift where you

149
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,800
have a camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> on left and what you do is</font>

150
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,450
you just see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the camera sees it's</font>

151
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,700
the normal one one copy of the real

152
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,490
world but what we can do that is truly

153
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,800
to adjust the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latency it's very funny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

154
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,260
see people fighting as a mortal 1587

155
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,050
expertly later it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible</font>

156
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,420
right if you want to try it out we also

157
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,980
did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a catwalk in application</font>

158
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,280
nowadays you can just download it and

159
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,200
just try it out yourself so if you don't

160
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about what is this mighty kind of</font>

161
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,760
use cases I mean steering something like

162
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,950
humanoid robots is something interested

163
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much for us if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

164
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,840
industry and 4.0 I psychology and

165
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,790
Germany or industrial<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet if you</font>

166
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about something like robots</font>

167
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,090
nowadays<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are standing still they</font>

168
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,160
have one program and they're just

169
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">running that in the future these robots</font>

170
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,720
will interact with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other and then</font>

171
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,460
you need the 182nd if you talk to cooker

172
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,910
with meeting these robots they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say</font>

173
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,310
one incident is unless in there it would

174
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,290
like to go lower than that and then of

175
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:02,340
course then you have something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

176
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:05,610
kind of drones flying in the air not

177
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,679
only using this network to control these

178
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,500
drones a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think about</font>

179
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazon just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bring in my next new gadget</font>

180
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,280
but here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot of these things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

181
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">are building the network not only that</font>

182
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're using it they can also build it</font>

183
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,340
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only the drones could be</font>

184
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,010
cars there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like smart grids</font>

185
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,780
when you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> control different kind</font>

186
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,190
of energy grids and wind plate if you

187
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,380
want to bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> that together you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

188
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:31,170
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to and look at the faces</font>

189
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,580
they have your 50<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hertz and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the energy</font>

190
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,490
grids if you want to put them together

191
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,530
one millisecond is already 80 degree of

192
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,680
facebook so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 milliseconds</font>

193
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,569
this is a shortcut well we can live with

194
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">reactive power but shortcuts it's not</font>

195
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,350
what we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> also interesting</font>

196
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,390
these were<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first people came in</font>

197
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming just saying and when they heard</font>

198
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,800
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one millisecond they said hey</font>

199
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,020
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network for one reason we</font>

200
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,258
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so the farmers out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

201
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,929
field they want 187<font color="#E5E5E5"> my job this play</font>

202
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,209
or say if the flowers get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't want</font>

203
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:05,839
one millisecond the rest also<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

204
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:08,849
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay my father's view and</font>

205
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,089
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> just explained is it that has to do</font>

206
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,649
with the control of the of the machines

207
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:15,419
to each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

208
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,279
something the way they have to be very

209
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:20,249
precise and the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want</font>

210
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,959
to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be precisely on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground so</font>

211
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:23,129
the soil is very important they don't

212
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,949
want to go a little bit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

213
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,749
right out of here<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing really work you</font>

214
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:30,899
have localization and they do though the

215
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:32,189
nation but communication plummets one of

216
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,189
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I did not mean here I</font>

217
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:36,748
<font color="#CCCCCC">just make it a little bit more</font>

218
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:38,429
emphasized on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

219
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:41,369
Germany and reveal about with car

220
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:43,439
manufactures is about already control

221
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:46,129
that you have in a car apparently you

222
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:48,748
have controlled between the wheels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

223
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:51,179
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already one millisecond or to</font>

224
00:09:48,749 --> 00:09:53,129
Billy second depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the where you</font>

225
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,689
buy it if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bus system it will be</font>

226
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:57,209
one millisecond when the wheels

227
00:09:54,689 --> 00:10:00,118
communicate to realize something<font color="#E5E5E5"> ESC or</font>

228
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:03,299
abs I mean future what we want is we

229
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:06,389
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have cartoons right and if you</font>

230
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:07,949
have platoons that is not only single

231
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,839
color you have to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all</font>

232
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:11,309
the wheels you really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring them</font>

233
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,759
together to<font color="#E5E5E5"> own a clean very few hours</font>

234
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:16,230
50 centimeters half are there has to be

235
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,329
really precise communication and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

236
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,970
more things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into your cue the</font>

237
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:23,248
more complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> because so the one</font>

238
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,769
question is why do we do I didn't really

239
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:28,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">need communication why don't you can</font>

240
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:32,039
just you how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know his cars right also</font>

241
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:35,519
notices for me cars that are just rely

242
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:37,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">on their own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> senses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to minute I would be</font>

243
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,660
them so what you see here these are some

244
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:42,269
robots and these robots are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

245
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,368
following the line and then they have a

246
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:46,499
distance measurement to understand what

247
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:48,619
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of them and what you see is</font>

248
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:51,059
then doing a pretty good job right and

249
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:53,699
they do it as long as there is no

250
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,409
disruption<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wait</font>

251
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:57,238
even if my treatments are running that

252
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:59,729
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see there's a disruption coming</font>

253
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:01,919
in the end and the first one will stop

254
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:03,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you will see the second will</font>

255
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,759
stop and the short one will stop nicely

256
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the force one and after the force</font>

257
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,949
one you get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of cakes this</font>

258
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:11,760
is control theory if you combine linear

259
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:14,189
system

260
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,220
or you go to order number<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight any</font>

261
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,560
other problem right then so therefore we

262
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,030
need some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of communication and what</font>

263
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,280
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have is something like this</font>

264
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,500
system right if you have a network and

265
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,520
the cost can communicate directly but

266
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,860
you also would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

267
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,900
communication where you go directly to

268
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,850
this kind of streets and what you see is

269
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,740
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something like this you</font>

270
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a network that can steer the cars</font>

271
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,780
into dating section and this network

272
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,760
what it will do is it will combine all

273
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,949
the sensors of all hands together you

274
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,960
make better decisions remember the Tesla

275
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,030
problem it was looking for a truck

276
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,060
didn't see the track if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just would</font>

277
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,949
know that there is a transom so and just

278
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell you that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have built something</font>

279
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,390
like this and you what if you want the

280
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,480
video is there on five th left Germany

281
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:02,550
de web page we built such a system where

282
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,010
you have eight cars they still have all

283
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,829
turnover sensors but may also on fire a

284
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,120
network share these this high with each

285
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,420

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,380
if you don't he laughs and that's it

289
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,780
just let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you the last cycle to</font>

290
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,030
last year but this is the one where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

291
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,100
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come to where you say you and</font>

292
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,900
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 5g you have these</font>

293
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,720
requirements and we shall make the other

294
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,420
kites are the bullets where you would

295
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,000
say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what idea Charlie good right</font>

296
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,339
most of them and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,440
have to fulfill get 5 cheat right if you

298
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,450
think multipass multipass this piece

299
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,450
here at half<font color="#CCCCCC"> this year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network coding is</font>

302
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,440
over here network slicing so all these

303
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,660
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are currently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're discussing</font>

304
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,430
this already but if you formal together

305
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,230
this is what we call with five th all

306
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,630
right so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will hear about</font>

307
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,780
this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we are the right place</font>

308
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,460
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's mai-chi just to understand how</font>

309
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,930
we relate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the new vehicles</font>

310
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:17,370
thank you very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> crimson French can</font>

311
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:21,239
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> so come I think we wanted to have</font>

312
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,450
some Q&A but yes we live it to the end

313
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,450
okay

314
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:38,850
you don't need yeah and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

315
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,100
hear that was fine there you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

316
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,710
own one right no no there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

317
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:51,100
this one oh you be the presenter ya know

318
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:53,560
the USP now your seats in there was

319
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:59,440
there i<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the ESP cuz that's the</font>

320
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:05,770
control which PK no you need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

321
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:07,720
that monday<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great um hi</font>

322
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:11,530
my name is conquerors and today i'll be

323
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:15,030
presenting<font color="#E5E5E5"> ila four five Jake this is</font>

324
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:21,640
some work that Julie's Miller from AT&T

325
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:23,530
myself have been kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting so we</font>

326
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,960
present or if you're that a little bit

327
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,300
last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> grade the ball n minus their</font>

328
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,030
worries thank you buck and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give a</font>

329
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,209
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail specifically how I la</font>

330
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:36,760
might be applied to five feet so just a

331
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:41,320
quick recap my layers and identifiers

332
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:44,500
locator kind of protocol we split ipv6

333
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,140
address into locator<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier the</font>

334
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,480
upper 64 bits are round of all these are

335
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,689
potentially identify each physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

336
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,670
the lower 64 bits for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifier this</font>

337
00:14:52,690 --> 00:15:00,010
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the virtual or logical</font>

338
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:02,620
address um so given that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the 500</font>

339
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:05,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">corgis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parvez I Cleon sinking ipv6 these</font>

340
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:10,300
really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit for that how do you need</font>

341
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:12,940
equations for the onion flavor so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

342
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:16,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">so there's obviously a lot of management</font>

343
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:19,600
role playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine ok so the component so</font>

344
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,829
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice thing about Iowa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run on</font>

345
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,750
imposing devices work from the network

346
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:28,080
one important thing obviously is a

347
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,400
mapping database so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is mapping</font>

348
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,460
identifiers which again are like the

349
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,970
local<font color="#E5E5E5"> or logical address to the physical</font>

350
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,720
address of devices so in order for net

351
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,709
were like this

352
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,689
we have to distribute this mapping table

353
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:45,508
conceptually the site is the full size

354
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:49,240
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the table is up to the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

355
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">object which can so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font>

356
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,180
ways to scale this into the 500 million

357
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,189
or training range and then there's a

358
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,800
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> lane behind all of this which</font>

359
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:02,349
distributes the map in and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

360
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,240
somewhat like a routing protocol there's

361
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,000
actually some national efforts for doing

362
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,189
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in BGP but we tend to</font>

363
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe it's more of a very large-scale</font>

364
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:16,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">distributed database will have some</font>

365
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:19,509
probably some more work to do on that so

366
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:26,740
look again so did this mapping database

367
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:30,160
is Indiana's wife DNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's mapping one</font>

368
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:33,490
64 bit number to another essentially so

369
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,810
it's a database lookup one of the things

370
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're looking at and I believe we're</font>

371
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,989
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start it's a mailing list on</font>

372
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:40,508
this is something called hyperscale

373
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,309
address management it's basically

374
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:44,199
tackled this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think we believe</font>

375
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:47,680
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> generic problem we've already</font>

376
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen this in the context of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NGOs 3 where</font>

377
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,969
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to map virtual addresses to</font>

378
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:57,779
physical addresses but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a larger</font>

382
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:11,619
we are intending to deploy my<font color="#E5E5E5"> OA and</font>

383
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,689
this is kind of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overview of it</font>

384
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:17,469
fundamentally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's simple it's fairly</font>

385
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:21,250
simple a source in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packet does a dns</font>

386
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:24,039
lookup usually yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> manager s and doesn't</font>

387
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,199
go this address<font color="#CCCCCC"> other than the normal</font>

388
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:28,960
ipv6 address sends it on to the network

389
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,960
and somewhere the network we can

390
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually translate this basic virtual</font>

391
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,179
address into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> physical address by</font>

392
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:41,890
overriding the first verse 64 bits with

393
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:44,980
a look actually I locator so in this way

394
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,929
we sending packets untranslated the

395
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,380
eventually hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> over Colin I Oleg router</font>

396
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:50,760
that does a translation and that's

397
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,040
and on to the actual physical

398
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,080
destination where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> note with that</font>

399
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,970
identifier please and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

400
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,510
optimizations we can make actually as if

401
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,160
the post device<font color="#CCCCCC"> supports I la we can</font>

402
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,370
have some sort of redirect like

403
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,870
mechanism resolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol send it</font>

404
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,330
back to the host and try to eliminate

405
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:13,739
the triangular around so there's some

406
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:15,780
optimization can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go n to it looking at</font>

407
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,300
kind of some of the other solutions or

408
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">concepts specific to 5g I would say</font>

409
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:24,240
there's a few advantages<font color="#CCCCCC"> by awake so one</font>

410
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no consolation involved if</font>

411
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:32,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you send 64 by an IP packet ipv6 packet</font>

412
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:36,179
in I la is translated as a 64-byte ipv6

413
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:39,300
packet the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network will see this if it's</font>

414
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,520
a TCP packet at<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the tcp / IP packet</font>

415
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,520
which means it can do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the normal</font>

416
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,310
network optimizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware off loads</font>

417
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,580
of things like that also since ur throne

418
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,230
capsulation we eliminate a lot of the

419
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,139
headaches of encapsulation and trying to

<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out MTU issues dealing with you</font>

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,940
transport layer this is really a

424
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,400
difference with<font color="#E5E5E5"> IL NP which actually</font>

425
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,620
kind of basis violate I like being

426
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,630
require some changes all the way up<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

427
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the transport layer which really makes</font>

428
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,520
it hard to party to plumb the post and

429
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,750
then on a router or I'm not sure what

430
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,650
they do I guess they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some sort of</font>

431
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,650
proxy um<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing is</font>

432
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,880
yeah I look at this is also transparent

433
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,980
in the application which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is nice and</font>

434
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,050
good so one of the nice things we want

435
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,180
and the mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases make the</font>

436
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:41,040
application s tram as transparent as

437
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:42,780
possible to the networking by search we

438
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,480
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an open source implementation</font>

439
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,870
so this basics of the I la hoz have been

440
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,350
up to greenville<font color="#E5E5E5"> endings for a while and</font>

441
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:54,929
we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hackathon less on good</font>

442
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Saturday Sunday and the cisco guys</font>

443
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:00,030

outer and SVP which is another high

447
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:10,300
performance data pack so the upshot of

448
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,270
that is we believe we can implement and

449
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">I only router in commodity Monday</font>

450
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,220
servers commodity<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware basically</font>

451
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,510
pretty official so we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font>

452
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,780
700 million packets per second gone

00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,220
through a normal server<font color="#CCCCCC"> go annihilate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

454
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,220
it's not to say that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> you someone</font>

455
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,910
martin report but we can deploy without

<font color="#CCCCCC">hardware support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the initial ground</font>

457
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:35,920
so looking at the requirement specific

458
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:38,110
to mobility 5g we want to consider

459
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:42,190
homogeneous or heterogeneous<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gandalf</font>

460
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:46,059
when you crossed networks IP addresses

461

changing things like that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single user</font>

device via mobile versus a whole network

463
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,309
so that cruise ship analogy when the

464
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,610
curtain goes whole networks change

465
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:59,980
location in the network where<font color="#E5E5E5"> would I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">only run so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font>

run it between the border router to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:37,840
of efficiency latency at some point we

478
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:41,260
want to push that closer to the user

479
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,949
closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the edge so for example in</font>

480
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,390
this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> to user devices could talk</font>

481
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,179
just through the base station to each

482
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,309
other the gradation does the ILA

483
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:53,470
translation handle handles that or you

484
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,910
can talk between base stations and of

485
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,650
course we always want to be tough be

486
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,600
able to talk from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user device all</font>

487
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,330
the way that internet or external

488
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,250
networks in which case the ILA really

489
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,678
occurs at the end so the middle of the

490
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,170
network you would see Iowa after five

491

mentioned we have we do have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability</font>

495
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:21,049
to push us into the host my concern with

496
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,489
mobile obviously is this does require

497
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:25,799
modifications to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the OS Android</font>

498
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:27,840
what have you it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very possible and it</font>

499
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:31,408
becomes a nice optimization especially

500
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,059
in a multi-homed coast which obviously

501
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:39,320
most mobile devices are going to be

502
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:43,289
anyway so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of control plane</font>

503
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:48,119
pended answer your question identifiers

504
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:49,830
are allocated globally within Facebook

505
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,899
we have a mechanism to basically

506
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,210
allocate unique identifier than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

507
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:56,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">stamp so what kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depend on the use</font>

508
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,649
case we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe there will be some</font>

509
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:00,840
higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> allocations so for instance if</font>

510
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:02,758
true providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're participating in</font>

511
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,639
this each of them could have one

512
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:08,399
component of the 64-bit namespace then

513
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:09,928
they can allocate identifiers within

514
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:11,580
that space as they wish now these

515
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:13,169
identifiers are compatible<font color="#CCCCCC"> with two</font>

516
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,228
different fighters so they could

517
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:17,460
participate in ila and with the next

518
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:22,950
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we didn't get an interview</font>

519
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:25,489
scandal there's some more detail that

520
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:31,220
mostly Julius<font color="#E5E5E5"> did is more specific to</font>

521
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:31,220
some of the 5g architectures and

522
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:39,570
pertaining to the at the model of 5g we

523
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:41,189
also want to consider when we do move

524
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,649
the applications into the network I

525
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,289
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the only ultimate goal</font>

526
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:48,178
will make the service model<font color="#E5E5E5"> closer to</font>

527
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:51,539
the actual devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> to telling that one</font>

528
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:53,369
millisecond latency in this case we can

529
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:57,619
have the application servers and

530
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:57,619
participate directly and in newcomers

531
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:04,408
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes yeah thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ella tom so we</font>

532
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:12,409
go to the next the next talk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

533
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:17,930
bitter dispute<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay just clean this and</font>

534
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:21,840
yours<font color="#E5E5E5"> is better playing this fun</font>

535
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:23,700
yeah okay all right thanks amor<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mele</font>

536
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,169
this this kind of our subject takes

537
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,700
about an hour and a half of questions

538
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,700
I've tried to distill it down to 10

539
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:32,640
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and soggy kind of interesting</font>

540
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:35,790
then we'll start with just the whys and

541
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,710
what's of slicing the first presenter

542
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,420
talked quite well about all the

543
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,430
different permutations and combinations

544
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,950
of the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> faces and whether that</font>

545
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,330
requires different aerator faces to

546
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,790
support them all but essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

547
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of it as different qos different</font>

548
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,710
purely requirements for many different

549
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">types of new agency guy or T devices</font>

550
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,030
which require low bandwidth and almost a

551
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,620
connectionless type interface and then

552
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:01,410
smartphones of course with very high

553
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,969
bandwidth the delay<font color="#CCCCCC"> or blind reliability</font>

554
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,260
requirements which you saw in some of

555
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,910
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> first videos and you can imagine</font>

556
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:09,390
extending that<font color="#CCCCCC"> out into a real</font>

557
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,820
automotive environment it's scary but

558
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,310
then you've also got issues like very

559
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,310
fast mobility mobility I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> dv/dt</font>

immobility I mean in terms of the speed

562
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,690
at which something is moving and the

563
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:27,420
current OFDM technologies which are used

564
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,820
with 4G today don't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> up high</font>

565
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,470
mobility speeds but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want</font>

566
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,480
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> more fun ability speed that's</font>

567
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,580
not necessarily efficient for things

574

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,370
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and challenges of chopping up</font>

other interesting issues around being

00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:10,379
able to create networks quickly and

583
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,780
migration and so forth another way to

584
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,930
think about what slicing is you can look

585
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:19,530
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from the ue right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end user device</font>

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,460
as a slice lose you

591
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:34,019
department slice now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the</font>

592
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,269

593
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:37,710

594
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:39,600
hard about different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of describing</font>

595
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,600
this the easiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I can come up</font>

596
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">with for folks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself it's think</font>

597
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,649
of it as a set of subsets all the

598
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,590
resources I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain that in a minute</font>

599
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:51,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">but that set of subsets forms a new set</font>

600
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:55,259
which essentially becomes an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-to-end</font>

601
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,669
network so from the yuli's perspective

602
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:59,789
there there are three or four different

603

<font color="#E5E5E5">ways you can slice eue right Ichi we can</font>

be in a different in its own independent

605
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:06,418
slice that's pretty obvious pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

606
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:08,428
I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> come vertically through the you</font>

607
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,229
eat and have different essentially

00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:12,629
different virtual machines inside the ue

609
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:15,869
so the radio access technology presents

610
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:19,349
itself to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an individual sios sees one</font>

617

you at the same time present themselves

as<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interfaces to a single or less</font>

00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:45,749
see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll eat and of course you</font>

622
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:48,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into complicated combinations</font>

623
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:49,679
and permutations of<font color="#CCCCCC"> foods too so they're</font>

624
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:52,499
they're slicing from a unique

625
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,049
perspective now from a networks

626
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:58,139
perspective it gets a lot more

627
00:27:54,049 --> 00:28:00,749
sophisticated a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complicated the</font>

628
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:05,340
way I'm describing this is the slice is

629
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:06,840
a subset set of subsets so the universe

630
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">of all the resources that I have</font>

631
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,090
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to chop up to slice who starts</font>

632
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:14,519
with the antennas the analog front hall

633
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,709
next to those antennas and then these

634
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,419
three sets in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> here represent</font>

635
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,639
the digital signal processing which is

636
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,619
essentially driving those antennas so

637
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:24,238
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU and</font>

638
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:26,759
hardware resources that drive the

639
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:28,979
antennas fabric which interconnects not

640
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,200
that hardware and<font color="#E5E5E5"> compute resources and</font>

641
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:33,269
then here we refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the numerology the</font>

642
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">mathematics or digital signal processing</font>

643
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:38,129
which is actually implementing OFDM or

644
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:40,009
other technologies at the antennas so

645
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:43,320
from here how is sort of an analog

646
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:47,340
interface from here back we

647
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:51,000
have backhaul pocket interfaces so this

648
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:55,080
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a data center fabric it could</font>

649
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:00,420
be a core network transport network etc

650
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:02,520
and then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual core network</font>

651
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:05,070
of the packet processing portion of the

00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,660
of the 5g network<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forging</font>

653
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,270
network which is essentially in Italy

654
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:13,440
the implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> walls the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers all</font>

655
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:15,900
of the resources and so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then a</font>

656
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,900
slice can be thought of as taking a set

657
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,300
of these subsets so some of the antennas

658
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,500
some of the front wall some of the

659
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,139
digital signal processing fabric

660
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:30,480
resources and numerology some of the

661
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:35,780
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the data center resources for</font>

662
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:38,400
the record and you do not have to have a

663
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:40,230
proper subset right this can be you can

664
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can use the complete set if you want</font>

665
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,420
you for a slice which leads you to an

666
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:48,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting diagram which shows you that</font>

667
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,150
I've got four different slices red blue

00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:54,780
green<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yellow slice that they're</font>

669
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:57,150
sharing resources up to the point where

670
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,710
there's a fork in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources here for</font>

different radio access technologies

672
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,720
perhaps the red slices using a different

673
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,580
type of OFDM different different spacing

674
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,400
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> sub carriers which are better</font>

676
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:17,430
others require more normal OFDM and then

677
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:19,530
we're splitting here at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EPC so I'm</font>

678
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:23,850
using different core processing maybe

679
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:26,190
one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a traditional IP core</font>

680
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:30,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe one of the others is this based</font>

681
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:33,000
warm on one of the non-traditional IP

682
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,800
core so you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibility of</font>

683
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,230
running and splitting at different

684
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,870
points and I can split into two

685
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,460
different further slices after I finish

686
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,110
the report pro system because I might

687
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,130
have different content but I wish to

688
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:49,229
provide or different downstream

689
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:52,230
processing so the slicing can be thought

690
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:55,110
of not only in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of the physical</font>

691
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,610
resources but logical partitioning that

692
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,110
happens

693
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:01,040
straightens<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost haunting these</font>

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,980
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this ability to to to create</font>

696
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:08,270
slices then the obvious question is that

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,730
I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able to move</font>

resources from slices lights and again

699
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:16,070
this starts with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the driving requirement</font>

700
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:18,260
at the input which is that I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

701
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:21,020
move spectrum from one slice to an art

00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so take your point in time one</font>

703
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,889
of my slices is going to use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font>

processing and we walk across it down

712
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:43,040
the street to do the packet processing

713
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,219
and that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> need more capacity</font>

downstream for the interconnect this all

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,790
know how to do make<font color="#E5E5E5"> before break here in</font>

718
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:57,470
forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know how to do think before</font>

720
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:04,700
doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the way</font>

721
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:08,929
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the front</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the system alright</font>

722
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:11,480
so just to to quickly go through some of

723
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:14,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the areas that are potentially a packet</font>

724
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,940
or impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 5 g vice versa obviously the</font>

725
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:20,450
address in growth visit is an

726
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:23,720
interesting concern information-centric

727
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:26,809
networking and this are very interesting

728
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,150
topics because they potentially require

729
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:31,820
a change in the ue and that's always

730
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:34,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">their impediment for some of these new</font>

731
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:37,340
technologies we're slicing there will be

732
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibility of changes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ue and</font>

733
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:42,260
there will be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibility to run</font>

734
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:44,120
brand new technologies experimentally or

735
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,750
even to migrate them from experimental

736
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,540
into something interesting worldwide

737
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,250
through through slicing technology so

738
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:56,230
slicing technology is is an interesting

739
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:58,220
way to adopt these new and interesting

740
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:00,230
evolution so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're going on</font>

741
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:06,440
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimun yeah we showed two minute</font>

742
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:07,910
um now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just distracted I'm sorry and</font>

743
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,860
so there's also there's also the

744
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,690
possibility I could said

745
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,969
using these technologies internally to

746
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:15,309
the next generation course as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce</font>

747
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:19,390
Kimberly so the sort of two interesting

748
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:22,510
use cases for ICN<font color="#E5E5E5"> listed cetera in this</font>

751
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:34,570
into the GTP of course could potentially

752
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:37,179
be extended the function chains because

753
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:39,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next generation cocky quorum in</font>

755
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,100
implemented will be implemented

756
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:47,500
virtualized within within a cloud

757
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:51,370
interconnect downstream all those Corban

758
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Collins to load balancers and firewalls

759
00:33:51,370 --> 00:34:00,070
and so forth is a perfect application

760
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:01,720
for sfc I to RS forces and other nasty

761
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:04,480
and related technologies are highly

762
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,460
relevant because we some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packet</font>

763
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,159
core functionality is essentially

764
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:12,429
virtual router and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> virtual routers</font>

765
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,929
are should be split into a virtual set

766
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:16,030
of virtual control planes and a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

771
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,580
is one of these technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yes</font>

772
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:30,550
times up times up anyway multiple other

773
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:34,779
technologies probably another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

774
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:36,850
great interest is multipath TCP because

775
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,379
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said in my first or second slide</font>

776
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:41,859
will be showed the ue with multiple

777
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:44,500
slices multipath TCP is an ideal way to

778
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:46,779
use those two interfaces and it's

779
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,369
entirely luckily the 5g radio access

780
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:52,510
technology is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come over</font>

781
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:56,230
concavity for prior matter so and of

782
00:34:52,510 --> 00:35:01,380
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang everybody yeah okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks</font>

794
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,759
it turns out that most of this mobility

<font color="#E5E5E5">if you want to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a longer version he's</font>

802
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:27,880
come to that and also i'm doing a Pecha

803
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kucha presentation on thursday night at</font>

00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,130
1030pm sorry so late but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

805
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:35,890
describe the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of list it's</font>

806
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:38,109
kind of this mr. nikken in the fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

807
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:41,290
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe the entire</font>

808
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:43,180
chronology of loose so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would explain</font>

809
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:45,040
in this presentation why this solves a

810
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,660
mobility problem and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

811
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,550
explain that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually two forms</font>

812
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,770
of separation and use located on the

813
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:52,960
separation and that we also have an

814
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:55,810
optimization column where we can do

815
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,180
handoffs at near zero<font color="#CCCCCC"> packer class so i</font>

816
00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:01,240
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue with that or just do you</font>

817
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:04,390
does the audience want to see one minute

818
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,629
one slide presentation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> list yes or</font>

819
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:11,440
not yes look because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think there's</font>

cap sleeves all packets after that

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay host Rob pretty much it's been</font>

861
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:00,930
experimented over the last 20 years it's

862
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,790
pretty much a non-starter if you if I

863
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,370
have an IP address and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

866
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,310
that's moving has to be injected

867
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,140
everywhere in the routing system that's

868
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:15,480
going to cause handoff problems too much

869
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,009
state and there's also policy

870
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,200
restrictions where the horse<font color="#E5E5E5"> crops can't</font>

871
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,540
get everywhere you want to get where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

872
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,569

874
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,480

875
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:32,100

876
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:34,890

home if I have an IP address it is

00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,609
attached to a subnet that means it's

879
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,839
part of the topology somewhere in the

what's moving is something that's fixed

could Peter sent me to support and using

slicing that's something we maybe could

00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:56,899
experiment them but we probably want to

use this solution this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the IP</font>

but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arlo's are actually in the</font>

958
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,450

basically how is this fit on the current

five-year proposed 3gpp architecture now

983
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:24,259
if you look at this slide there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

984
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:26,630
here this is existing Nautilus sites

branch offices data centers where you

986
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,890
see these double color things these

987
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,839
where it lists can run so those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

988
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,970
sites over there a branch would list a

00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:36,920
data center with<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists and now we can</font>

990
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:41,959
look at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possible combinations of</font>

00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:44,240
where you could put less<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so first</font>

992
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,010
and foremost today list was running in

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,078
these environments where r SI PE routers

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,640
so this internet does not have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry</font>

the IP addresses of each of the course

00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the first thing we could do is</font>

998
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,869
we could put this peer into the

999
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,150
encapsulation between the s gateway in

1000
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:06,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be that would</font>

1001
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:10,790
be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get is</font>

1002
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:14,060
whenever a uni moves ue<font color="#CCCCCC"> Simon Eid it's</font>

1003
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:15,529
an IP address can be v4 or v6 one

1004
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,109
question that has the answer would find

1005
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">cheap is how you explicitly not support</font>

1006
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:23,420
acted before very important question

1007
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:25,520
anyways if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you eat moose from this this</font>

1008
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">SMS gateway to that s gateway then the</font>

1009
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,200
new binding is done so the PK menos and

1010
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:34,490
caps like<font color="#CCCCCC"> there versus there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1011
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:36,649
that would be a good solution another

1012
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:38,810
solution is clicked closer to the movie

1013
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,390
andy so then you get much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more granular</font>

1014
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:43,640
mobility domains or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vig moves from one</font>

1015
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:46,640
note to another you could have it done

1016
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,490
there in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases where the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decap</font>

1017
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,250
happens at the peak gateway it could

1018
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:54,770
rien kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maybe a branch rather than</font>

1019
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,540
its talk to maybe this phone is talking

1020
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,359
to something at a branch this guy in

1021
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:02,150
caps lates d caps<font color="#E5E5E5"> lakes the packet from</font>

1022
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:04,098
here re encapsulate here this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1023
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:07,210
called an RTI function we encapsulate

1024
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:11,210
internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> rocker that could be done</font>

1025
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:13,160
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best solution is to keep it</font>

1026
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,619
close to the moving entities so you have

1027
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,240
good granularity and that he had caps

1028
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:18,860
lakes all the way to where he has to go

1029
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,790
this is

1030
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:24,950
supporting an overlay where the

1031
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:27,380
functions are in the network as close as

1032
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:30,620
you can to the edges<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a network but</font>

1033
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,900
not in the edges yeah there's no reason

1034
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:35,450
why that top Iraq switch that's doing

1035
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> D capsulation can't be in a vm on a</font>

1036
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:40,640
server somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> today's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think</font>

1037
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:43,670
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a network function let's say the</font>

1038
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,460
CPU resources in the you ease and then

1039
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:49,400
the servers for doing applications and

1040
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:51,560
let's put risk in these various things

1041
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,880
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want you to you know when we have</font>

1042
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,590
the time I want to entertain thoughts

1043
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,150
and where<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think the best place to</font>

1044
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:59,810
put in you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a lot of</font>

1045
00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:01,550
flexibility there we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want list to</font>

1046
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,259
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to go from this point to that</font>

1047
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:07,760
point so could support all the various

1048
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:09,520
flows is Michael<font color="#CCCCCC"> here oh yeah okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1049
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,220
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to call them yeah</font>

1050
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:15,500
there's another released talk so just

1051
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:32,959
hang around and Michael Michael meant ok

1052
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:37,550
Michael and we need the USB yeah it's in

1053
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:40,760
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh No</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where is the aim USP that</font>

1054
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:46,880
comes into somebody took it is not in

1055
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:50,060
session maybe where is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it then I'm will</font>

1056
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:57,590
have to go your speed that comes with

1057
00:47:50,060 --> 00:48:00,200
this anybody has AI using this one yeah

1058
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:04,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know it was here something anyway go</font>

1059
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,149
ahead Michael I'll change from here we

1060
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:14,930
agreed on my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is clear.its</font>

1061
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:18,730
microphone is like a fun yeah this is

1062
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:21,770
slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> different but it's work him</font>

1063
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:23,180
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also located identifier squid</font>

1064
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:28,100
but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of different</font>

1065
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:31,069
flavor than a lisp and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> LA and the</font>

1066
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">application of 5g context is probably</font>

1067
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:35,829
pretty much the same that's why

1068
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:40,010
I will concentrate on the differences

1069
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:44,089
this is a work that was discussed about

1070
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:46,160
say eight met eight years ago in the

1071
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:48,740
research routing group and it was

1072
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:52,868
published some years ago in the future

1073
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,868
internet journal so next slide please

1074
00:48:52,990 --> 00:49:00,500
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of you we have an ipv6</font>

1075
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:05,118
internet backbone we have some local

1076
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:08,480
domains and the idea of GOI split is

1077
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:11,569
that we have a routing locator that is

1078
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:14,660
specific to a local domain and which

1079
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:16,790
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> local locator and routing</font>

1080
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:20,149
locator that is specific to the global

1081
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:23,839
routing domain and within the local

1082
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:27,200
routing domain we use addresses that are

1083
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:30,380
composed of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local locator and the</font>

1084
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,348
identifier and within the global routing

1085
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:36,710
domain we are using an address that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1086
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:39,440
composed of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the identifier and the</font>

1087
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:42,349
global<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> global locator that's the</font>

1088
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,510
main idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the attachment point</font>

1089
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:46,430
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> local routing domain and the</font>

1090
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:51,530
globe will go out global routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> main</font>

1091
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:54,950
a so-called GLI gateways this is very

1092
00:49:51,530 --> 00:50:01,280
similar to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other approaches like an</font>

1093
00:49:54,950 --> 00:50:07,098
<font color="#CCCCCC">IT RS or so interest handle router we</font>

1094
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:10,550
have a interworking concept with exit

1095
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:14,300
with classic ipv6 domain and within a

1096
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:19,609
GLI domain we may<font color="#CCCCCC"> use classic ipv6 nodes</font>

1097
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:22,220
and upgraded G&I ipv6 nodes next slide

1098
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:24,740
please<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you can change it</font>

1099
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:27,009
yeah I realize the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DSP is already there</font>

1100
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:32,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and you can use those as a point</font>

1101
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:35,000
okay so some nomenclature we have the

1102
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:38,690
identifier we have a local locator and

1103
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,339
the identifier is used to look up the

1104
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:45,480
local locator in a local mapping service

1105
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:48,840
the global locator can be looked

1106
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:55,170
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a global mapping</font>

1107
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:57,750
service so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the address structure</font>

1108
00:50:55,170 --> 00:51:00,510
we have three<font color="#CCCCCC"> different types of</font>

1109
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:02,609
addresses we have identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses</font>

1110
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:06,270
that contain only the<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifiers and</font>

1111
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:08,310
they may be used for lookups we have the

1112
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:11,130
local ad we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have local addresses that</font>

1113
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:13,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">consist of a local locator and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

1114
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:16,200
identifier that is used for local

1115
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:18,869
routing and we have the global address

1116
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:24,200
that is composed of global locator and

1117
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:27,260
the identifier so this allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1118
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:29,790
an attachment attachment attachment

1119
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:34,820
points within a local routing domain

1120
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:37,859
that are independent independently

1121
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:39,930
recorded in the addresses so we can

1122
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:42,840
change the attachment point in a local

1123
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:45,660
routing domain without changing the

1124
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:53,790
attack without it without changing the

1125
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:56,700
global address of the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so how</font>

1126
00:51:53,790 --> 00:52:01,470
does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work then within a sink within</font>

1127
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:04,618
a local network<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a node 1 and</font>

1128
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:10,020
node to a node one wants to communicate

1129
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:15,560
with node 2 so it looks up the local

1130
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:15,560
locator and pushes this local locator on

1131
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">on to the packet header and this packet</font>

1132
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:30,420
can be used for forwarding in lowering

1133
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:32,880
context this works similarly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> node one</font>

1134
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:36,869
wants to communicate with note to it

1135
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:40,710
looks up in the local mapping service

1136
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:43,500
look at the local locator for note 2 but

1137
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:45,600
it cannot find it so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> carries the</font>

1138
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,850
global mapping service and finds the

1139
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,720
global locator for this destination node

1140
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:54,259
this packet is forwarded through the

1146
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:12,510
we need this<font color="#E5E5E5"> July gateway to hide any</font>

presented some years ago firms as a

00:57:56,579 --> 00:58:01,559
very powerful it must be reliable it

00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:39,299
do we go from here so will this become

1277
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:42,599
we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buff oh yeah all or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay yeah that's a good question now I</font>

01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:37,349
don't know if that's gonna make people

1342
01:02:45,059 --> 01:02:49,529
relevant pieces of work I've actually

1343
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:52,619
like to see a draft charter even if it's

1344
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:54,390
a crap version just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a joke charter to</font>

1345
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:56,459

1346
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:58,078
right above yeah well I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even just</font>

1347
01:02:56,459 --> 01:02:59,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">going for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bob let's just put some</font>

1348
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:01,829
staff down on a piece page make some

1349
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:04,289
children and then and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can argue</font>

1350
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:07,140
about it on the list and then we can see

1351
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worth doing with with summer</font>

1352
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:11,160
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it is your prob you probably</font>

1353
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:12,390
are not going to have a botnet off next

1354
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">time or at least not a working group</font>

1355
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:15,359
forming one because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1356
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:16,920
anyone's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> approve it but you</font>

1357
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:19,799
could aim for March and I think that's

1358
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,690
probably a better time frame so I think

1359
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:23,069
you're right about that but let's start

1360
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:25,739
arguing about a charter because there's

1361
01:03:23,069 --> 01:03:30,150
enough people here so okay thanks

1362
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:32,339
Natasha well you busy will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok Don</font>

01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:37,160
go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right done before i'm</font>

1366
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:39,440
kicking being kicked out just my

1367
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,990
observation it's from the presentations

1368
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,630
and the draft that i have read right now

1369
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know if I'm to write</font>

1370
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:50,450
a charter of if I'm to do a ba victory

1371
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:53,390
exactly where it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be long but i</font>

1372
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:56,689
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen like disparities the pieces of</font>

1373
01:03:53,390 --> 01:04:01,790
works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe long in routing may</font>

1374
01:03:56,690 --> 01:04:03,589
belong in the internet area some of them

1375
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:07,460
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be actually incremental work due to</font>

1376
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:09,380
existing working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group so there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

1377
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:12,619
much work to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe that</font>

1378
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:16,400
Beckett is perfectly right we need to

1379
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:18,920
actually to do show activity on the

1380
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:21,369
mailing list right draft and especially

1381
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:26,050
comment an answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment in order to</font>

1382
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:28,880
kind of help crystallize and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so our</font>

1383
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:31,480
layer of the ideas here and understand

1384
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:36,920
what what what we where we can add value

1385
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:40,069
EG I gave absolutely thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> no way</font>

1386

1388
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:47,270
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 5 g's not time force like</font>

1389
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:49,308
the slideshow presentation it's a time

1390
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:51,710
for defining what you want to do or what

1391
01:04:49,309 --> 01:04:54,670
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> needed to do with in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IDF and to</font>

1392
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:57,680
define the scope of the work because

1393
01:04:54,670 --> 01:05:00,020
3gpp will not wait for two years to have

1394
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,450
any solution there's already working on

1395
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:05,900
the zia closing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the architect network</font>

1396
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:10,308
and the even even we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty work</font>

1397

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre 5g work ray-j a shake you well</font>

1398
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:16,220
yeah we have we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have also</font>

1399
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:18,618
protocol safety it's a CSP for security

1400
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:20,808
but for the protocol aspects in<font color="#CCCCCC"> city</font>

1401
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:22,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">level we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have already some work on going</font>

1402
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:24,109
on separation between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control plane</font>

1403
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:26,450
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say we are following closely what's</font>

1404
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:29,390
going on a trip of course the point is

1405
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:33,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not coming up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a in</font>

1406
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:37,879
in a short time with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> charter and a and</font>

1407
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:39,400
a concrete work plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it all this</font>

1408
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:44,750
discussion will be a useless because

1409
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:47,050
3gpp will not wait for any solution so

1410
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:50,120
so so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying you should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hurry up</font>

1411
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:53,660
yeah absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> so then then then do</font>

1412
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:57,170
like a dancer you can sum up it like

1413
01:05:53,660 --> 01:06:01,609
that do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan said okay I guess</font>

1414
01:05:57,170 --> 01:06:04,220
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it folks thank you to all the</font>
