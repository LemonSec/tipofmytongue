have a very focused<font color="#CCCCCC"> agenda fairly like</font>

27
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,389
the agenda I will start with a quick

28
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,049
summary of the working group status and

29
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:04,219
we have two main presentations which are

30
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,599
essentially the two key deliverables

31
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:10,520
that the working group is working on

32
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,610
first we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the</font>

33
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,109
connection oriented model and if you'll

34
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,430
remember the connection oriented model

35
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:27,889
went through working<font color="#E5E5E5"> robles call it many</font>

36
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:30,940
of the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> and corrections fixes</font>

37
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:30,940
that were sent to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list were</font>

38
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,989
incorporated into a new version I think

39
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:39,050
the editors are still working on

40
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,719
incorporating edit so we're going to

41
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,090
hear an update the goal here is to

42
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:45,530
understand

43
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,448
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection oriented model</font>

44
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,809
what's needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually take it to</font>

45
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:53,539
working group last call and you know

46
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,940
getting also a bit of guidance from<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

47
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:58,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">why that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also a good time to engage</font>

48
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:03,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> young doctors for the connection</font>

49
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:06,050
oriented model the second topic is about

50
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,930
the connection list we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

51
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:12,229

53
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:20,270

ITF this is still an individual

56
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:31,310
contribution is draft Kumar so the goal

57
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,769
here is to understand where we are in

58
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,328
terms of actually formally adopt in this

59
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:37,849

different grouping for Meg ID in maad

193
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:15,070
because if we look at a philosophy of

<font color="#E5E5E5">transition from CFM to 1731 and mpls-tp</font>

does follow their philosophy of 1731

196
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,339
that mag ID is just a different type of

197
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,640
ma ID and a short ma name so probably it

198
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,860
could be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

199
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,930
yes the different types o which will

200
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,979
help us do multiplex and interpret

properly the format<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's again it's</font>

can provide some no solution our

240
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:05,450
how I because because otherwise why

241
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:10,310
there isn't need to replicate their

242
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:13,790

00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,470
om mpls-tp or am yang model oh I mean I

245
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,899
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the argument is the other way</font>

246

around in the sense that burials

<font color="#CCCCCC">generalizations that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exist in this</font>

know a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology specific</font>

252
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:42,860
ones but rather the mpls-tp one needs to

253
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">be you know constructive and eloped is</font>

254
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:48,949
such that it references and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

255
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:53,500
but but my<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern is that this document</font>

256
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:56,840
are you goes into specific of mpls-tp

257
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so it uses mpls-tp specific</font>

258
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:04,610
constructs rather than using some attack

259
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:08,750
identifiers then can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> then mapped into</font>

260
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:11,959
technology it you see what what happens

261
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:14,060
so basically it it provides the

262
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,410
construct which are technology-specific

263
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:20,360
whether it's a trail or mpls-tp right

264
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,920
but in this case and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't disagree</font>

265
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,870
right but in that case if<font color="#CCCCCC"> these provide</font>

266
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,810
the document provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> an on technology</font>

270
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:39,830
propose<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's let's look at where this</font>

271
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:42,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">nonspecific ends and where a specifics</font>

272
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:47,210
begin so the specifics contained in

273
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:50,210
mpls-tp yang data model and then can be

274
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,040
argument it from mpls-tp data model

275
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,020
because yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it a</font>

which does not belong in the car I don't

out with the technology specifics out of

283
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:15,409
here excellent yeah it also great oh

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:17,990
yeah ramen<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco Greg your comment</font>

with Michael about this this morning

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:26,290
particular regarding the addresses in

435
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:28,720
particular regarding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> topology you</font>

436
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:30,639
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to spin a new version and</font>

437
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,320
we you know we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> should take</font>

438
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">advantage of the fact that that were</font>

439
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:40,470
here in by the way and the topology Alex

440
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:40,470
Clem is also here in in barling

441
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:06,160
okay okay good morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone my name</font>

443
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:14,530
connection connection is OEM model

444
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:16,810
status update and so the chapter<font color="#E5E5E5"> bushing</font>

445
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:19,090
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> colonel latest number is the 05</font>

446
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:22,360
and if you was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a blue this new</font>

450
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:33,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we also add a new author</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cherie and</font>

451
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:38,230
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of input and happy</font>

452
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:40,090
to improve this<font color="#E5E5E5"> chapter yeah so what</font>

453
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:43,510
happened since the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> night a meeting</font>

454
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:46,449
so actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> after last I the meeting we</font>

455
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:50,050
had we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ensure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a meeting and for</font>

456
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:53,440
the connection is again we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have</font>

457
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:57,070
a dedicated session in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second</font>

458
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:01,860
interim eating we have a editor session

459
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:04,540
to join<font color="#CCCCCC"> with author and as a participant</font>

460
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> homework rebels and some other</font>

461
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:11,620
people we go through this whole chapter

462
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:16,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 99 page by page you to do the editor</font>

463
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:19,060
and we got a lot of comments so we make

464
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:21,820
a huge up database these comments and

465
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:26,770
later actually we receive some comments

466
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:30,820
from young doctor and and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

467
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:32,530
the comments very useful we also raise

468
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:35,200
these comments the issues update

469
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">adjusting in this week and from some</font>

470
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,360
other comments is just some offline

471
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:43,710
comments from the reg pad and Sam and

472
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:47,889
some other cortical from my company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

473
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:49,900
also I mention we still we still have a

474
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:52,750
line a compatibility with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crazy we</font>

475
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:55,840
waiting for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> updater after we</font>

476
00:33:52,750 --> 00:34:00,390
progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a discuss its chapter</font>

477
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,389
and we can we can follow that follow up

478
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:07,390
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a highlight in the model</font>

479
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,779
design goal here actually we what we do

480
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,059
is

481
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:13,599
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined the base model is so</font>

482
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:17,950
frame look confused by the connection is

483
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:21,279
OEM OEM technologies the<font color="#E5E5E5"> commish om</font>

484
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:25,598
actually we r fo care a free number<font color="#CCCCCC"> tfd</font>

485
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:29,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">mpls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oen up he um and there may be some</font>

486
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,690
as a finish her name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> om come up and</font>

487
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:33,970
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually take the top down approach</font>

488
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:36,159
instead of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> autoharp approach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

489
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,828
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will allow the customer to</font>

490
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,169
use this model to talk with the

491
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:42,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">management system the management system</font>

492
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:47,020
can take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model to</font>

493
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:50,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">perform the ultimate net the photo tag</font>

494
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:54,239
notes and isolation so we also have the

495
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:57,279
model design detail it's actually a

496
00:34:54,239 --> 00:35:02,589
document in the backup slides and we can

497
00:34:57,279 --> 00:35:04,660
revisit it if needed so so what chain

498
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:07,180
will make since the last I came eating

499
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,740
and to interim eating<font color="#CCCCCC"> foster change</font>

500
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,770
actually we made it we remove the

501
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:15,368
improper the parameter that for the

502
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:17,770
tools in the base model based on

503
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:21,339
secondary intermediate discussion mostly

504
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:23,799
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> color so we think is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maker is</font>

505
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:27,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">very mixed sense so we remove these can</font>

506
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:31,509
incorporate parameter and we also align

507
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:34,329
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> modal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> description in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sections</font>

508
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:36,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">three with model hierarchy to make it a</font>

509
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:41,710
more consistent and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

510
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:43,029
cosmetic<font color="#E5E5E5"> change and we also remove the</font>

511
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,609
pair of the source and destination

512
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:50,829
address the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interior and theory address</font>

513
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:52,808
from the ITF connection model<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

514
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:55,750
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention we actually broke broke</font>

515
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:58,539
down the this base model into to model

516
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:00,430
actually is connectionist model another

517
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:03,990
is actually it's only a mess of the

518
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:07,089
model we<font color="#CCCCCC"> sink a facedown bottom a</font>

519
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:10,149
top-down approach we think is better we

520
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:13,750
actually can have more reusable building

521
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:16,510
blocker and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this can be reused by a</font>

522
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:20,349
various different connection is om

523
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:21,640
technologies and for the longing sort of

524
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:24,819
shortly

525
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:27,700
issue actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sensible the colors</font>

526
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:29,769
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he already follow up and grow up for</font>

527
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,480
properties<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss melodies then we have</font>

528
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:32,890
a good discussion we narrow down

529
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,990
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sing we should use that</font>

530
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:39,848
emoji that defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> FC 7276 that is used</font>

531
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:44,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">and among and proactive so we closed</font>

532
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:46,480
this issue and and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned we</font>

533
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and buy more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into two</font>

534
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,059
models so here is that it reach reach

535
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:54,279
our map<font color="#CCCCCC"> Messer that we actually</font>

536
00:36:51,059 --> 00:37:00,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed and define it as a separate</font>

537
00:36:54,279 --> 00:37:02,740
model and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also we added some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> common</font>

538
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:05,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">session information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

539
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,509
so you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using during blockers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

540
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:12,250
can be applied to the VIP or some other

541
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:13,720
clannish<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2m technologies and for the</font>

542
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,119
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitoring father actually</font>

543
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,788
this is something has already discussed

544
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:20,769
many times we sink is bad you separate

545
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:23,170
out and we have several chaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss</font>

546
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:25,118
this I think you doesn't need to be

547
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:28,859
covered<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the by this the connection</font>

548
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:32,259
connection connection is OEM model and

549
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:35,828
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FEC is as the attribute of the</font>

550
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:39,039
TP and location has been removed from

551
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:41,920
the connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> OEM model based on</font>

552
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:50,769
discussion I think it's from the grad

553
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:55,500
yeah I Greg<font color="#E5E5E5"> mercy so yes if we then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

554
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:59,049
if offers would like to have phones

555
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:01,150
monitoring as a separate model then I

556
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:03,569
would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

557
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:09,190
characterized as a fault management

558
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:11,049
model that's first and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case if</font>

559
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:14,769
the performance monitoring will be a

560
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:17,980
separate model then I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

561
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:23,140
mention t101 because it's a performance

562
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:27,369
measurement methods protocols ok so

563
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:30,129
again if you plan to have a separate

564
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:32,230
model for performance monitoring so then

565
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,840
this model effectively is a fault

566
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,720
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

567
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,820
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> gori</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> om actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comprised</font>

568
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,740
to power minus 4 imagine that thursday

569
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,370
is problems in monitoring currently we

570
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:47,500
actually for the popcorns monitoring and

571
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:50,529
I think it's summer<font color="#CCCCCC"> workout to cover by</font>

network puppy technology use cases and

574
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:58,840
so we check out and by the way we still

575
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:03,520
won't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually more have no</font>

again um I i would i would encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

580
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:23,379
separate because that probably would

581
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:26,439
make it easier to to make this make this

582
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,050
our community both of these models it

583
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,240
yeah otherwise otherwise if if we talk

584
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:35,770
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> t whump Oh whump we must talk</font>

587
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:43,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">here exit to try to model the existing</font>

traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> OEM technology rather</font>

589
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:49,299
actually only focus on photo management

590
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:51,399
we actually try try to cover where's OEM

591
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:54,580
protocol you know so we need to have a

592
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,190
generic name<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it is ok it's a choice</font>

593
00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:08,529
of the offers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can only suggest cannot</font>

594
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:10,750
force you to do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay another</font>

595
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:14,350
wise powder passive lomito am discussing

596
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:16,570
and I think we is actually also provide

597
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:20,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">for futaba by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kernels and we</font>

598
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> several terminology</font>

599
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:29,470
and in active and passive and and in

600
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:33,370
banner up and we better<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand well</font>

601
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:35,259
water this term means and i think we

602
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:38,200
sinker these the patio am like a

603
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:40,210
standard asian so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree actually</font>

604
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,290
auditors currencies you wish to this out

605
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:47,480
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get these passive own</font>

606
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,100
standards some somewhere we can actually

putback putback again at a disease

608
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,180
moment I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasonable</font>

609
00:40:50,960 --> 00:41:00,170
to cover this in this connection is OEM

610
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:03,290
model so so actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are now actually</font>

611
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:06,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">closed the passive perform my master</font>

612
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:10,369

00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,930
a define and<font color="#CCCCCC"> based on schedule and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

616
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:23,930
adopt this one yeah that's all thank you

617
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,209
you know I have 11 initial question can

618
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:28,419
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak up a little bit about the</font>

619
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:31,880
relationship between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document and</font>

620
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:34,760
other technology specific ones so you

621
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,470
mentioned that you know you've been

622
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,540
working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deepak on the applicability</font>

623
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:42,529
you've been working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rashad on the</font>

624
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:44,690
BF the relationship can you can you yeah

625
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:46,850
yeah in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colonel Chad we did have a</font>

626
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,340
section to discuss the relationship

627
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:51,618
between this model and as a model we

628
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,390
actually we clarify in this light

629
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:55,520
actually we have some motor design

630
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:57,980
concept that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> sink this model yourself</font>

631
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,780
at space model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of generic</font>

632
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,330
framework that can be extended by the

633
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,510
various<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology specific on model and</font>

634
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:07,250
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> broke down the base model into to</font>

635
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,940
model actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mona as still outpaced</font>

636
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:14,960
to base model and about the idiot depend

637
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:18,560
on use cases and you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> post basic</font>

638
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:22,369
mode or use one of base model and for

639
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,740
the apricot applicability wiki<font color="#E5E5E5"> page and</font>

640
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:28,880
we plan to follow up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk with a</font>

641
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:32,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">rich hat and to get it solved and and</font>

642
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,810
and we will update this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> pigeon we</font>

643
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:39,410
picture the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fall out of it is the reg</font>

644
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:43,340
card and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I know be of these</font>

645
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:46,310
meaning tomorrow sometime but in a

646
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:49,160
racialist as the BFD chair and Greg I

647
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:54,859
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> your editor of the BFD young model</font>

648
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:56,390
Oh perfect excellent even better I know

649
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:58,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">things might change you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

650
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:00,259
meeting tomorrow but you know what was

651
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,400
the status of that document within the

652
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:04,340
BFD working girl

653
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:13,940
bus as far as you know state in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

654
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:15,890
progression<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rashad ramen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco the</font>

655
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,540
state of the dark is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean so we made</font>

656
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:19,160
some there's been changes also in the

657
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,690
routing model regarding routing

658
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,200
instances and all that so there's been

659
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:26,300
some churn there the big thing remaining

660
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,640
in my opinion is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

661
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,370
you know what greg was mentioning we

662
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,069
just need to close I think for<font color="#E5E5E5"> BFD for</font>

663
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Less beeping so the UM technologies but</font>

664
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:38,540
also the networking technologies and

665
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:41,180
sense of this is not just give these not

666
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:44,330
on its own you know BFD runs on an MPLS

667
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:46,399
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> kale st mpls-tp multihop single have</font>

668
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,259
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you are aware of this right so I</font>

669
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,120
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes back to Greg Sookie</font>

670
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:53,750
comments that you don't want to be

671
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:55,759
redefining let's say mpls te the way the

672
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,470
tunnel is configured the way the LSP is

673
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,920
in operational state in multiple places

674
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:03,200
we should be reusing augmenting or stuff

675
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,240
like that so we just need a common way

676
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,069
for everybody to do that and I think

677
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll be in good shape we're not there</font>

678
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:15,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">yet we're closer than we were but we're</font>

679
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:19,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">not there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet yes again as I said</font>

680
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:22,970
characterized the current version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

681
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:28,910
d model does cover singlehop<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop</font>

682
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:32,089
and in LSP there is a micro BFD I think

683
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:37,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's still standing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

684
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:40,330
there yeah okay um the what what I

685
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:44,600
wanted to say is that Rashad mentioned

686
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:48,759
ls15 so I just want to inform that work

687
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:52,640
on LSP<font color="#E5E5E5"> think yang model will be</font>

688
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:56,270
reactivated and there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

689
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:59,120
brief discussion at pc session which

690
00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:05,150
will discuss common yang models between

691
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:07,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">pc and pls TS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> & Seek am NOT that's</font>

692
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:10,550
insightful I mean my view was thought

693
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:14,720
that was a little bit stale yeah I agree

694
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:18,410
I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and based on</font>

695
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:21,730
request of mpls more group chairs the

696
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:24,410
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be restarted and activated</font>

697
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:27,170
thinking and you know from from my side

698
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:30,049
as chair<font color="#E5E5E5"> had on in a similar comment as</font>

699
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:33,380
we did with the the connection oriented

700
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:36,050
model in a world here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Berlin we all</font>

701
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:39,020
have our air max I know time is is you

702
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:42,410
know pressing and were you know running

703
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:45,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">in between dinners and meetings and you</font>

705
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:52,099
find in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of minutes to do on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">real time editing on on some of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

707
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:59,060
the fastest<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make progress on on</font>

708
00:45:54,230 --> 00:46:02,300
this more in Turing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Qaeda dishes right I</font>

709
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:05,029
agree so we should make earnest effort

710
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:09,710
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but personally I would say</font>

711
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:15,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the two sessions that we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was in</font>

712
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:17,480
my view very successful so I say thanks

713
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:21,220
to offers they were very considerate to

714
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:23,869
the comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we didn't have any</font>

715
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:27,348
shortcomings on technology so it all

716
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:29,470
worked and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we cannot</font>

717
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:32,750
make everything that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve</font>

718
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:45,230
this week here then schedule some

719
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:47,089
similar sessions thinking Francisco so I

720
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:50,570
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the document is good at optus</font>

721
00:46:47,089 --> 00:46:53,750
but I have one more of a kind of a

722
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:56,810
structural comment and so given that you

723
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:59,359
now broke apart the data that we

724
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:01,310
retrieve from how we will treat the data

725
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:05,060
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is a major step forward</font>

726
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:07,580
um don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to go and have those</font>

727
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">things sit in separate documents longer</font>

728
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:11,750
term because that would make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it far</font>

729
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:13,879
easier for other people to say okay I

730
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:17,750
have another method to expose the data

731
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:20,359
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using IP fix or something else I</font>

732
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:23,839
have other methods to go and retrieve

733
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:25,069
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> data not with an RPC method and so</font>

734
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,170
that would be far easier for other

735
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,520
people to leverage a particular document

736
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,980
as opposed to the new roof

737
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,259
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has an overloading of</font>

738
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,610
RPC methods that you are clearly not

739
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:39,860
interested in if you're using a

740
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:42,650
different vertebral method as also are

741
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,660
no strong opinion is and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

742
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,940
depend on chair to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a decision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

743
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,859
this I mean easy you know it's a working

744
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:51,920
loop decision it's not my decision but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

745
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:53,870
will say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that there's</font>

746
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,980
advantages or disadvantages of inner

747
00:47:53,870 --> 00:48:00,529
fragmentation um you know modularity is

748
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:05,120
greatest is enough figuring out what is

749
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:08,270
the the the right granularity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

750
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:11,540
fragmentation so i don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's</font>

751
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:12,710
you know perhaps no i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean i was</font>

752
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,480
thinking is that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for young</font>

753
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:17,300
doctors is that a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us</font>

754
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,270
independently to make a call on any

755
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:28,550
guidance from other young documents in

756
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:30,290
other working groups been on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Benoit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CLIs</font>

757
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:34,490
so right now these are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

758
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:36,560
yang models or not or a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> one right</font>

759
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:41,149
now actually to model in the same jobs

760
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:43,190
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so maybe this is a good</font>

761
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:45,320
step in the right direction because if

762
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:52,450
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update one module you need to</font>

763
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:55,580
update I mean avangin you want to update

764
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:58,660
the one with natural methods<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the</font>

765
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:02,330
young module with natural methods right

766
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:05,270
so from a young model point of view we

767
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:08,900
could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I understand it if you</font>

768
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:15,460
want to always have this rfcs then you

769
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:20,060
have to update but no no strong opinion

770
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:22,370
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the right point so you know I</font>

771
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:24,259
mean that he'll whatever it feels right

772
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:26,180
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that perhaps you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know one</font>

773
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,610
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Frank if if I could</font>

774
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,140
please ask you to actually post a

775
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:32,210
question on the list and perhaps try to

776
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">summarize very high level pros and cons</font>

777
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:38,330
you note of you know having the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

778
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:41,450
the RPC moving independently into

779
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:42,350
documents ah then we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see</font>

780
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:45,830
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what the word</font>

781
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:47,540
roopa any preference but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jalur it</font>

782
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:49,279
is good right the goal is right as

783
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,870
correct was mentioning earlier like I

784
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,540
mean we try to do something generic and

785
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:56,600
I need those data and independently of

786
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:59,540
how I get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very wide goal so up</font>

787
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:01,160
to you now different questions in the

788
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,600
one and topology I haven't read the

789
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:07,220
latest version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the document but how</font>

790
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:09,500
do you connect with topology<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh actually</font>

791
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:13,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we did augment</font>

792
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:16,370
from the network topology model so the

793
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:19,279
one from hrs what the the one from I to

794
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:21,740
RS yes yes oh because I was checking

795
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,690
that and I'm I was missing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i'll</font>

796
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:26,359
delete this will actually follow these

799
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,870
connectional random we didn't follow

800
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,000
that concept because I single connection

801
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:38,540

and I potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that question to</font>

837
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:28,340
the least anyone has any concerns with

839
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:32,630
the question you know I think / our

840
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:35,030
charter this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem we need to</font>

841
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:38,330
solve so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to ask if this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

842
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:40,700
something worth working on the question

843
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:43,670
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have is does anyone has any</font>

844
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:49,689
concerns as this document being the base

<font color="#CCCCCC">BFD USB thing is something very</font>

852
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:19,880
important open question so I would think

853
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:23,930
that once we solve it then yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

854
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:26,930
have very good basis for their working

855
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:28,580
group to continue work but i would say

944
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:43,900
talking before the meeting is that

01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:27,860
because if you generate some load a lot
