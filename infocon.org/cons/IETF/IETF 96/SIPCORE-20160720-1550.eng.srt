much more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> half an hour but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,560
have plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of padding at the end in</font>

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,679
case it does and this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,600
done by Dale from remote and I will

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,270
again ask if he can get in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the queue</font>

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,429
because we're pretty much done with this

26
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:23,080
part of the presentation and we moving

27
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:26,860
on to his work momentarily Donathan is

00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:39,869
me one real quick thing here<font color="#CCCCCC"> before we</font>

get too deep

<font color="#E5E5E5">here we go okay how's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jump in I mean</font>

32
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:13,350
everyone's getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> pissed off and</font>

33
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone so yes there is you can hear me</font>

34
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,700
you should have an unmute control that

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,600
allows you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put yourself on the screen</font>

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:25,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">here can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear me oh there we go</font>

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,090
brilliant<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i found the unmute</font>

38
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,710
control it's not actually labeled

39
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,390
terribly well I suspect that's what's

40
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,600
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on is I have a separate interface</font>

41
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:41,220
because I'm connected using a special

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,490
the screen that we're showing right now

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,238
it should be your slide I do see the

45
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:56,989
slides is my volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's perfect</font>

46
00:02:48,239 --> 00:03:00,270
yeah okay start when you're writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

47
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:03,540
this work is what is essentially happy

continuation of work that's been going

51
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,829
on for quite some time next slide please

change the target order that's

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:54,169
prescribed by rfcs 3263 and 2782 so that

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,090
it can give

reduce timers BNF without reducing t1

181
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:49,910
that lowers the number of

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,550
next block of work is a series of issues

192
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,490
that show up in large-scale deployments

193
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:28,660
and become intensified with dual stack

194
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:31,510
deployments because of overhead concerns

195
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,250
dual stack usage has to support

200
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,689

as I said seems to be a perception that

203
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,410
the overhead involved is excessive we

204
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,210
need to know why that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worth</font>

205
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,640
checking should we define some sort of

206
00:10:55,210 --> 00:11:00,700
subset or revision of outbound that

207
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,740
reduces these overheads so that overhead

which is the title of this slide our big

234
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,649
problem is there is instability in

networks particularly with mobile usage

236
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:31,079
you get changing connectivity as to

237
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,449
which IP addresses the device is using

238
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:36,000
and even what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> address-family it's</font>

239
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:40,199
using you get intermittent network

connectivity among one of the things

241
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,380
that's necessary to make this work<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

some sort of good good failure detection

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,140
your item has apparently changed

288
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:53,060
significantly when we can no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer hear</font>

289
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:56,890
you correctly you may you may be in an

290
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,890
unstable network and need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recover</font>

291
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:21,280
Jonathan can I have you suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him</font>

292
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:21,280
that he a disconnect and reconnect<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

293
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,850
only you seem to have an answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font>

294
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,930
question though so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

295
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:34,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">it a microphone that would probably</font>

296
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:37,489
helpful while we wait Allah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Johansson I</font>

297
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,349
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of scope for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work</font>

298
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:45,080
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> hype eyeballs and I think if you</font>

299
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:49,490
switch the previous slide I think this

300
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:53,360
also is not really in scope and I would

301
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:55,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to focus on setting up a flow and</font>

302
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,160
that's the whole focus now that we have

303
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,410
the other drafting process we need to

304
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,540
discuss how to set up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow and the</font>

305
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,900
way I personally see it and i thinkin

306
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">saulo is with me we need to take</font>

307
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,250
transport by transport and say well for

308
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,530
connection oriented flows point2 happy I

309
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,720
balls and you can set up your flow and

310
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:19,370
we're practically done then for

311
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:22,370
connectionless protocols meaning UDP we

312
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,800
need to figure out ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon could be</font>

313
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:27,140
one way to register and then keep that

314
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,990
flow because it's not cold sensitive if

315
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,600
you already registered but we may need

316
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:36,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have other ways since there's a lot</font>

317
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,580
of hesitation about up on out there

318
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:44,769
so like specifically you don't want to

319
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,630
address as part of this effort right now

320
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:52,850
let me give you a very specific not

321
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:57,589
address recovering a call that had been

322
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:59,120
running over v6 by failing to v4 if

323
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:00,290
outbound does that for you great but you

324
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,490
don't want to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> that too happy</font>

325
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:06,918
eyeballs well as we discussed incipit an

326
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,679
event<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure you know outbound doesn't</font>

327
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,480
cover any recovery of a call and that's

328
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">not something I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on at</font>

329
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,870
some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on focus on setting up to</font>

330
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:20,569
call but we still need recovery or in

331
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:23,688
retargeting I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good work but</font>

332
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:26,959
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to help eyeballs and it can</font>

334
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,690
the mailing list told us that even when

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,720
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch from 4G 2 3g you get a new IP</font>

337
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,710
not only dual stack is single stack but

338
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:46,370
changing network okay real quick before

339

342
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">as I can see those three unrelated</font>

343
00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:01,790
problems we're looking at one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which</font>

344
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,860
is a setting up the initial flow and

345
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:07,040
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> what should pull in the</font>

346
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,780
happy eyeballs and in particular setting

347
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,830
up the initial flow food and reliable

348
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:15,379
transport there are two other problems

349
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:17,870
one of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gain low overhead</font>

350
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,790
encryption and another one is basically

351
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,570
closing whatever gaps we have in sip

352
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:25,190
outbound one of which is recovering and

353
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,408
I think what we should do is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

354
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,059
concentrate only setting up initial flow

355
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:32,419
at least in this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this is</font>

356
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:35,840
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the highest priority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

357
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:38,929
one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> o most closely</font>

358
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,129
in scope for this project and they are

359
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:41,929
the two problems again they're

360
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,650
interesting and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

361
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">addressed but they're not necessarily</font>

362
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,690
something which should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be solved all at</font>

363
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,690
once

364
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a homer I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

365
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,960
what the definition i think i've asked

366
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:00,030
this before and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me at</font>

367
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,890
what the definition of flow is when

368
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,110
someone talks about sending options with

369
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,000
max forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero it seems to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me okay</font>

370
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,040
this is a flow flow that goes to the

371
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">next hop because you're testing the flow</font>

372
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop is going to reject it</font>

373
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,860
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> output definition of a flow is</font>

374
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,010
something that goes from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ue to the</font>

375
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:21,928
register but then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point I</font>

376
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:24,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">think someone talked about the no no the</font>

377
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:26,250
flow goes to the register we you have

378
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the edge out pond proxies but the flow</font>

379
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:32,580
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminates at the register but then</font>

380
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,620
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I heard see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this word target so</font>

381
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,049
that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me saying okay this flow is</font>

382
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,580
something that goes into end so I'd

383
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:52,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like to know what what is the</font>

384
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:54,689
definition of flow in this case okay the

385
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:56,970
way again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see this problem is what you</font>

386
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,700
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you have a client which has more</font>

387
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,559
than one network available in leptin is

388
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,540
not only limited the door stack it's

389
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:07,110
limited to for instance having multiple

390
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,899
local<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighties and you do some sort of</font>

391
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,209
DNS resolution and you have multiple

392
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,640
remote targets available<font color="#E5E5E5"> her wish you</font>

393
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:18,299
can connect to the registrar so you have

394
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">almost like an ice-like set of original</font>

395
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:22,918
origination address the center and

396
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,590
destination addresses and realistically

397
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,500
client needs to figure out which source

398
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:32,250
and destination IP is to use to say to

399
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,690
send a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's fundamentally</font>

400
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,049
the problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're trying to solve</font>

401
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,309
so in this regard I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

402
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:40,830
essentially a flow that clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

403
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:44,070
needs to pick and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

404
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:46,470
mechanism on how to pick which flow to

405
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,928
use for the next sip message and

406
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,090
depending in the scope it's either the

407
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:53,580
flow for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire transaction or even</font>

408
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,470
a flow for each next sip message in the

409
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,689
transaction again if the transaction is

410
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:01,160
long running for the long time such as

411
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,160
like for instance initial invites

412
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:22,530
oh thanks do we have Dale back<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

413
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,990
crystal only one one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questions</font>

414
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:34,870
which represented here is why why why

415
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:37,470
people don't implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> outmanned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and one</font>

416
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:41,409
of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean one of the</font>

417
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:43,350
original reason for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Outman was that you</font>

418
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:46,720
have these different registration flows

419
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,699
that goes through nuts and if some not

420
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,670
binding go stance or something happens

421
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:55,300
you can switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> to another flow but i</font>

422
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:57,480
think that doesn't happen and it doesn't

423
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:01,210
happen often enough to justify

424
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,040
implementing outbound each registration

425
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,460
flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lease</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you come fro from from</font>

426
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,050
from from from the radio work when you

427
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a registration even if you don't</font>

428
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">send on it's going to consume resources</font>

429
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,760

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,120
registration flows and again in most

434
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,800
cases you're not gonna need those I mean

435
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,689
the Nets will be open they're often

436

00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:36,070
the reasons why why why people don't see

00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:40,300
the need for for for implementing

440
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:41,710
outbound a debt and I'm not saying

441
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,110
that's right or wrong I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

442
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's one reason so do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that</font>

443
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the v6 transition use case would be</font>

444
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:54,310
sufficiently compelling for people to

445
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:58,149
reconsider that well from where I come

446
00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:01,659
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> fro from from ims I don't think v4</font>

447
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:04,810
v6 is an issue as far as I know they

448
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">only use v6 or so so Jules there or I</font>

452
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:22,500
before you go real quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> bald on the cue</font>

453
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:28,080
um hi I'm I was just thinking is the

454
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:33,390
talk was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here if this is a</font>

455
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:35,580
problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that like what I mean</font>

456
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,740
connection reuse ended up being broken

457
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,290
into two parts one part was outbound

458
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:43,380
when it was connection reused to the

459
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoint and it was a different document</font>

460
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:54,690
between providers is that the case here

461
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:57,960
I mean you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know for a happy</font>

462
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,440
eyeballs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I meant in other words do we</font>

463
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:06,680
have a problem between providers at all

464
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,680
and if not in me is that was that clear

465
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:21,090
well uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee Jones on here I don't see</font>

466
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:24,330
any difference in those two cases yet

467
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:28,709
when I looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I mean it's just</font>

468
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:34,250
about finding a possible IP address to

469
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:37,590
play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> given a one dns name right and</font>

470
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,930
that applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> both cases but in</font>

471
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">response to Krista</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll pan doesn't</font>

472
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:46,410
require you to set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up all those flows it</font>

473
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:48,300
requires an implementation to support at

474
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:52,080
least two flows but you can run it with

475
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:54,149
one flow and that really helps in this

476
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,220
situation but it adds a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

477
00:24:54,150 --> 00:25:00,050
complexity for the developers I guess

478
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:02,640
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are not doing that oh</font>

479
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:05,629
just kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of to address both of those</font>

480
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,730
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all energy lines</font>

481
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:12,900

00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:14,730
a provider interconnect<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus consumer</font>

484
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,620
interconnects the number of providers is

485
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,649
relatively<font color="#CCCCCC"> small then transports are</font>

486
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,110

<font color="#E5E5E5">switching from ipv4 to ipv6 you you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">when you</font>

490
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it's a much less of a problem way you</font>

491
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,409
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dynamically determine which</font>

which can basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> which networking</font>

493
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,030
need to use to connect between two

494
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,920
providers on the client side you

495
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:44,910
essentially don't know what natural

496
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,580
client is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from so you know</font>

497
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:52,150
existed solution for what's deployed

498
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,740
right now so the deployed again clients

499
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:57,190
distributed across multiple networks

500
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,830
connecting to you without you knowing in

501
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,960
advance which<font color="#E5E5E5"> transported gonna commit</font>

502
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,909
so that's providers the second thing is

503
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,470
outbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not implement the</font>

504
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:10,330
implementing outbound i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

505
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,900
there are two parts to that problem the

506
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">first part is essentially outbound over</font>

507
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,240
UDP and one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons why outbound</font>

508
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,090
over UDP is not implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not</font>

509
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,299
implemented as much was because

510
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:27,309
host-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> natura verso for UDP worked</font>

511
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:29,620
fairly well for a long time so a lot of

512
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:32,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">people implemented that and did not deal</font>

513
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,360
with complexity of CP outbound there are

514
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,220
some benefits of doing see part 1 over

515
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,129
UDP because you know one device is

516
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,590
recovering but in reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> they haven't</font>

517
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:45,640
been big enough for people to implement

518
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:47,409
outbound of EDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ipv6 may change that</font>

519
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,940
the second half of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that problem is</font>

520
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:55,980
outbound with<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp or TLS and once you</font>

521
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:59,290
start dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with outbound over TLS the</font>

522

requirements the load only<font color="#E5E5E5"> registers</font>

523
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:05,500
grows tremendously and that's been one

00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the issues wire TLS has not been</font>

525

526
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,049
protocols have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not been deployed as much</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the large-scale deployments just</font>

528
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:15,160
because to scale it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same size</font>

529
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:17,020
deployments the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gdp will require a lot</font>

530

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources on the service provider</font>

531
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:23,410
side and the cost of extra registration

532
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:27,480
grows exponentially comparing to you so

533
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:32,470
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> being lit keeping people from</font>

534
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,480
deploying outbound with TLS and which

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a solution the peak for the</font>

536
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,740
dual stack it needs to work with

00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,030
connectionless like UDP protocols the

538
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,580
end I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the big</font>

539
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:46,100
problem then just essentially not

540
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:49,280
forcing people to do outbound over TLS

541
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:52,340
to solve have happy eyeballs or to solve

542

545
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:07,760

559
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:50,780
here hoddan of my question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with</font>

you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> P we can set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and select the</font>

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,010
failures and all that mess at

563
00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:00,140
registration time like an outbound then

564
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:03,040
keep the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow open we keep our lives and</font>

565
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:07,280
use it for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> incoming outbound calls</font>

566
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:09,860
so for UDP it's actually one leg

567
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:13,850
outbound flow is actually kind of a

568

575
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,560
are registration based there are

576
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:39,379
significant number of deployments which

577
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,750
essentially just an invite<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts will</font>

578
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,360
with the call from the client without

579
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:47,090
the previous registration so that needs

580
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,189
to be addressed as well and it's not

586
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:07,600
recovery if you're running a single leg

587
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:10,449
outbound if that fool fails essentially

588
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,899
in a world of cases because of the time

589
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:16,270
required to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the working flow and we</font>

590

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:22,810
as well all the end customer will hang

592
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,909
up so we losing it for essentially some

00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:29,230
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick recovery mechanism with</font>

00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:31,180
this one leg one leg outbound so that

595

the coal camp the signaling can be

596
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:38,310
recovered quickly enough in case of

597
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:41,710
either local IP address change or the

598
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:43,540
detail or the edge proxy failure so

599
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,340
that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think why</font>

600
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,170
this recovery came into the school

601
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,970
discussion but that's I think is one of

602
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the requirements for the goals that is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">being able to recover Oh like signaling</font>

604
00:30:53,950 --> 00:31:00,760
when the when the flow stops working so

605
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,020
although we actually had about cause<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

it in the queue I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go ahead and</font>

609
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:17,230

problems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the problems very small</font>

611
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:26,500
but um it seems like there may be a

00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">heaven image there may be some</font>

613

advantages to combining problems you

614
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:39,550
know in that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know losers a lot of</font>

615
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,040
focus here at UDP yeah because it's

616
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:44,399
believed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ran is up</font>

617
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:50,409
is too expensive or something you know

618
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:54,190
but you EP really doesn't give us the

619
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:58,870
privacy yeah and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the emphasis</font>

on opportunistic you know security<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font>

621
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:06,760
to me like there we can anticipate

622
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,660
there's going to be more demand for you

623

627
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:21,639
that with UDP right now so it seems like

628
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,780
either we're likely to need one way or

629
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:28,600
another to find a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make TLS</font>

630
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:31,120
acceptable in this environment or if

631
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,840
that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't feasible then maybe we</font>

632
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:38,050
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be figuring out how to use sip</font>

over<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS if if if in fact that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

634
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:49,990
actually mitigate any of the problems

635
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:54,010
with TLS<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool is you want some</font>

636
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:56,530
again I would be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my quest for</font>

637
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:58,540
deprecating a lot of old stuff I would

00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:02,470
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to deprecate you to pee but</font>

639
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:05,830
Roman wouldn't accept that I guess so I

640
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:09,510
mean let's stay focused on happy

641
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:13,770
eyeballs trying to find it the

642

643
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,300
TLS well with happy eyeballs we have a

644
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:23,350
solution for all connection oriented I

645
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:26,399
don't see any problem there really where

646
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:31,360
we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus again is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> UDP and</font>

647
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:33,580
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> since I mean outbound where</font>

648
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,840
you have to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with registering Roman</font>

652
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:51,880
solutions we've seen so far involves

00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:55,090
losing round trip times like in<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP we</font>

654

need to send something funny strange and

00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:02,350
see who responds quickest and then use

656
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:04,510
that connection for the real request if

657
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,490
you can't find if we can find another

<font color="#E5E5E5">solution I would be happy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but we've been discussing this for years</font>

without losing round trip times and I

<font color="#CCCCCC">response while we can do that but that's</font>

689
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:35,520
still we need a response from the server

690
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,670
saying I understand sip I understand you

691
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we have a working connection right</font>

692
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,900
so we instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of registering like an</font>

693
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,399
outbound we can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in another</font>

694
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,640
solution sending something that

695
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,040
generates an response so we know we have

696
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,290
up working sip server to speak with

697
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:59,310
that's the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea with hyperbole to</font>

698
00:35:52,290 --> 00:36:06,779
find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> works right yeah we</font>

699
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:08,279
have a water remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisbon's now a reply</font>

700
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,540
was that you will get the response to

701
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,330
reregister even if you don't use

702
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:14,640
outbound you send a register and you

703
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:19,160
will get the response if it works you

704
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,160
don't need that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for that right</font>

705
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:29,080
um John<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next my first point was that</font>

706
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,790
i mean i i'm i heard people sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

707
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:34,330
vaguely mentioned the server to server

708
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,650
case but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm still not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what</font>

709
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,090
solution people have in mind since

710
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,180
clearly outbound won't work for that

711
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:44,530
because you're not registering anything

712
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:47,080
and my second comment is too is is

713
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:49,090
probably you know shouting<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the wind</font>

714
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:55,240
but how sad I am that forking won't

715
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:58,120
solve this this is clearly working if

716
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,750
working worked you just fork to v4 and

717
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:07,020
v6 done I'm putting myself in the queue

718
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:12,070
behind Roman<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay put me in the queue to</font>

719
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:14,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so uh yeah again I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted to</font>

720
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:16,240
kind of say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

721
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,310
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working or at least</font>

722
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,669
working and thumbs oh there was a way to

723
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:24,460
a girl like if you design a registered

724
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:26,500
to a register or in a coprocessor to

725
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,420
aggregate transactions received over

726
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,840
multiple transports that works quite

727
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:34,600
nicely the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to</font>

728
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:38,610
mention which was related to a single

729
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:41,110
connection outbound what happens is even

730
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:43,420
what you get some outbound when you try

731
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:47,770
to set up the initial connection over

732
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:50,830
UDP you essentially trying to register

733
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,960
to register over multiple flows so you

734
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">are like even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

735
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain a single flow for outbound</font>

736
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,840
initially you'll end up with multiple

737
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:01,380
and what you get from outbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> a device</font>

738
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,910
ID knowing that all those multiple

739
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,590
registrations you got belong to the same

740
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,500
device so that's probably the main

741
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:10,290
benefit of using outbound was happy I

742
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:16,210
balls during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the initial registration</font>

743
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:18,850
that's it thank you thanks Adam<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roche</font>

744
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,890
again as if from the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

745
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,810
based on Jonathan's observation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

746
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,490
actually it meant to ask close to the

747
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:27,430
end of deals presentation but they are

748
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,859
you are you actually on again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

749
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:32,319
I'm on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I thought I heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your voice</font>

750
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,999
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a question around</font>

751
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,729
specifically

752
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:39,129
you'd mentioned that you either thought

753
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:41,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we could not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use or we're trying to</font>

754
00:38:39,129 --> 00:38:43,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">avoid request merging as a solution to</font>

755
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:46,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and it seems to me that since we've</font>

756
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:50,199
taken the pain of actually having that

757
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:51,279
specified in the protocol is it is

758
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:52,629
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we r you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is</font>

759
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:55,179
unaesthetic or is there some reason that

760
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:57,368
it actually won't work that's what I

761
00:38:55,179 --> 00:39:01,029
came up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic for can I and can I</font>

00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:25,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">fill in here I actually ran into a</font>

771
00:39:23,649 --> 00:39:29,109
situation in practice that had this

772
00:39:25,749 --> 00:39:31,479
problem we had a connection it was

773
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:35,889
actually a trunk between two switches

774
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:38,499
between two proxies that was not

775
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:41,829
particularly reliable it was configured

776
00:39:38,499 --> 00:39:45,569
using zip colon whatever the host name

777
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:51,969
was by which I mean it would attempt

778
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:53,859
both UDP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP what happens is a call</font>

779

<font color="#CCCCCC">the request both got there so they went</font>

00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:15,359

787
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:24,759
the user agent starts ringing the second

which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always beneficial Dale I I hate</font>

793
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:45,209
to say this but your audio has done the

794
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:45,209
same thing as it did last time

795
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:56,200
yeah that it I believe we heard the

796
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,760
answer if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can still hear us are you</font>

797
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">by any chance on a wireless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connection</font>

798
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,630
and if so can you get closer to the

799
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,040
access point this does sound like what

800
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:08,650
happens when people get too far from

801
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:11,009
Wi-Fi access points on VoIP<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we have</font>

802
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:15,270
many people in the room to assist you

803
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,270
it's this is the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

804
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,380
okay I Jonathan go ahead and I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

805
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:31,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and let us know when things are going</font>

806
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,180
better for him please<font color="#E5E5E5"> well they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will you</font>

807
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">want some coming back to Christus</font>

808
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:39,350
question why can't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just send a</font>

809
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:42,359
register<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see 3263 says that for every</font>

810
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:44,700
transaction you need to do the dns

811
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:47,279
lookups your register may end up in

812
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,740
another server you see another protocol

813
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,200
down the invite request so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

814
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,700
solving the problem with the call and

815
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,939
the problem with the call is to focus

816
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:00,509
because as they'll said in an earlier

817
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:04,230
slide waiting up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the default value of</font>

818
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:06,750
32 seconds before may be failing over is

819
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,760
a usability problem most people would

820
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:28,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">have hung up and called support on the</font>

821
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:29,970
mobile phone before that happens and

822
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:33,359
you're alone well we do have a way to

823
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:36,118
force a invite request to go to the

824
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,470
server and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use that in free to BP we</font>

825
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:47,040
have the service<font color="#CCCCCC"> route we can force</font>

826
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:51,830
invites to to go that's true yep that's

827
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:56,190
one solution so Allah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Johansson again</font>

828
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:59,910
the way I discussed this with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gonzalo at</font>

829
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:02,490
lunch was that let's first shop off the

830
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:05,220
connection oriented stuff and write a

831
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:08,069
recommendation on how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

832
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:12,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">properly a 23 page document without much</font>

833
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:14,640
discussion then go ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at our</font>

834
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:17,400
pond service route or if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

835
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,440
something else because as you see here

836
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,490
that discussion will take time so let's

837
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,760
pick these easy fruits and take you to

838
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:27,990
pee separately so it definitely sounds

839
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,890
like a reasonable approach to me if you

840
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:33,868
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break off a TCP document to</font>

841
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,460
progress that quickly so that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

842
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:36,090
are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP can get the call them</font>

843
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,850
solve for that

844
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:41,160
yeah we want to get the documents out

845
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:43,290
there for developers to work with so we

846
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:50,060
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> test that secret later that they did</font>

847
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:50,060
it right any other thoughts on that turn

848
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:58,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right Romans on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> queue now</font>

849
00:43:54,290 --> 00:44:01,500
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go ahead and have they'll</font>

850
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,240
pick the presentation of after that you

851
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,150
give them just a nip that this is not

852
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,540
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> DCP connection-oriented so TCP TLS</font>

853
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:11,460
all can be solved very easily just have

854
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:14,160
a quick recommendation for people to

855
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:17,220
know how to how to implement that for

856
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,990
anything connection-oriented ill<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken i</font>

857
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:25,350
agree UDP<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something which needs to be</font>

858
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:27,120
solved to<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a separate document I think</font>

859
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,500
whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is you're generally</font>

860
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,609
agreeing with a proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want</font>

861
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make certain we're covering things</font>

862
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:33,750
other than merely<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP yes exactly</font>

863
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything connection-oriented should be</font>

864
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,920
basically covered by the document

865
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,580
because that should be trivial with

866
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,990
happy eyeballs and with existing

867
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,430
specifications and connectionless is

868
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:49,879
something which needs would require a

869
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:49,879
separate document right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

870
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,340
okay Dale I'm handing it back to you now

871
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,979
if you're talking we can't hear you

872
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:19,900
Jonathan<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in the meanwhile I did</font>

873
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,700
actually I'm a little surprised that

874
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:25,480
that Robert didn't hop up at the mention

875
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,680
of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> were tweaking and this seems</font>

876
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,000
like a good guy I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're gonna</font>

877
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">have something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say on the top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back as</font>

878
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've slide so I didn't hop up because</font>

879
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,720
the way that this slide was presented I

880
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,780
who got the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong impression that</font>

881
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,810
the point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide was don't do that</font>

882
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:44,200
so they were felt no real reason to hop

883
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:46,299
up but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will call out that reducing t1</font>

884
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,399
is probably not a good idea you can get

885
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">rid of the word probably and in fact you</font>

886
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:57,369
can just say no you cannot do that to

887
00:45:51,100 --> 00:46:00,580
reduce t1 it is an error to reduce t<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

888
00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:03,010
on one hop of a several hot network that

889
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,830
where things are actually running<font color="#E5E5E5"> sup</font>

890
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:07,869
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not running a b2b you a</font>

891
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:10,720
right if you're terminating your set

892
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:12,550
better be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bu a and T 1 is all one</font>

893
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,649
thing on one side and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something else</font>

894
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:17,260
on the other side then it's your problem

895
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:19,000
is a b2b you a to you know figure out

896
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,470
the discrepancies that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

897
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,609
get the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience because there</font>

898
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:23,799
are going to be something they're going

<font color="#E5E5E5">to be very bad if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acting is a</font>

901
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:31,720
same on the side coming in and thus<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

902
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:33,100
going out or stuff just breaks right so

903
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,660
actually it wasn't that he one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font>

904
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,839
believe that that everyone understands

905
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,730
that that's the not good thing the

906
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,010
conversations so far though have

907
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,990
actually discussed turning BNF down to a

908
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:48,940
significantly smaller number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

909
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:50,770
retransmissions and I by its you know

910
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,660
that has some pretty strong implications

911
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:54,880
it's a proposal it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> require</font>

912
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:57,970
some analysis yes there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

913
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,100
strong implications it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> working against</font>

914
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:03,580
themselves to trade off getting things

915
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:05,020
working faster against not getting

916
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:07,060
things to work when they might have

917
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:11,480
otherwise in a semi flaky network

918
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:13,640
situation right right so if they

919
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,260
the folks that are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> this want to</font>

920
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,180
pursue it they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to write very</font>

921
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,400
carefully down what those trade-offs are

922
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,600
and get an analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whether or not</font>

923
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,670
they're actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth it</font>

924
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay what I wanted from you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was if we</font>

925
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">had different notions of time or being</font>

926
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,609
deaf in a network whether there were bad

927
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:30,529
interactions that you were aware of that

928
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:32,600
we needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make certain were part of</font>

929
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:34,430
that analysis since you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of</font>

930
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:39,170
the non-obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> timer interaction</font>

931
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:41,720
problems in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your head f is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

932
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:43,490
pretty the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the analysis for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> f is going</font>

933
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty easy to do the analysis for</font>

934
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:47,899
b is less obvious and i would have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

935
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,000
think about what would happen when when

936
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,960
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start messing with be a little bit a</font>

937
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:58,180
little bit more thoroughly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

938
00:47:53,960 --> 00:48:01,460
might run into similar problems with

939
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:06,618
false detections of failure to connect

940
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:12,380
on um invite when timer be is not the

941
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:13,609
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> on both sides of a proxy um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> F isn't</font>

942
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,920
really going to matter because that's

943
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:19,430
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> bound by t1 right but but</font>

944
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,070
because proxies can-can pinned be

945
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,720
matters so I'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go study it but</font>

946
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:25,850
need to look very closely at what

947
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,609
happens when B is not the same side on

948
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:30,470
on those two jobs ok can I lean on you

949
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:33,830
to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> end Nina all to the list after</font>

950
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:37,640
doing some thinking on that thanks Allah

951
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:41,330
Johansson I think for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide is</font>

952
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:45,379
out of scope for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our Bibles this is the</font>

953
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem if you do it seriously test one</font>

954
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,460
server first then you're going to run

955
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:53,450
into this time out and what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

956
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:56,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">avoid is exactly using timers we want to</font>

957
00:48:53,450 --> 00:49:00,140
set up the sessions in parallel and then

958
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,780
you can use timers as you always do

959
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:05,390
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that gets back to what my</font>

960
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:09,109
original takeaway was the I thought what

961
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:12,410
I was hearing what that this whole slide

962
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:14,600
was they don't do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that</font>

963
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:18,410
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how we discovered a</font>

964
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:19,190
problem that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the tests okay thanks</font>

965
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,129
that's not what I got from the

966
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:24,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation on the list but I may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

967
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:27,050
misunderstood on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font>

968
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:28,430
so just add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Robert's point so as I</font>

969
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,170
understand there's no way for the UA to

970
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,669
know whether it's whether they were

971
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:34,400
back-to-back<font color="#CCCCCC"> UAE's or proxies in the</font>

972
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:35,960
path so it for a generic solution

973
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:44,150
there's no way that you can reduce to

974
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:49,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">one right okay I don't even see Dale on</font>

975
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:52,250
the list right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now oh ok well let's see</font>

976
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,330
we had only three more slides I presume

977
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,410
that you were working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him on this</font>

978
00:49:53,330 --> 00:50:00,380
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> day do you think you could take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

979
00:49:54,410 --> 00:50:02,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the last of this some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

980
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:06,560
slides I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

981
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:09,020
some is based on his draft but he

982
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,870
covered the recovery right which i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

983
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:21,200
is a whole different issue than<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot</font>

984
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bibles right yeah I think so yeah so he</font>

985
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:27,169
came up with an ideal work play work

986
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:30,470
plan and I think in our discussions we

987
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:33,020
said well let's even more quickly focus

988
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:38,569
on getting rid of the connection

989
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:41,330
oriented protocols so we can focus here

990
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:47,480
I don't know I was suddenly thinking

991
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:52,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">websockets but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's ugly but some of</font>

992
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,890
this like upon light may or half a pound

993
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,210
whatever we call it was something i

994
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:59,109
start to discussing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

995
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:02,000
different set of problems which is TLS

996
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:05,030
but then we discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> that well it may be</font>

997
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,990
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solutions for UDP as well I</font>

998
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:13,040
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to define up the problems</font>

999
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:15,740
for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pee in a separate document as</font>

1000
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:20,990
you hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't agree with a long all</font>

1001
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:23,060
the details that makes life fun I keep

1002
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:25,819
allies and low overhead<font color="#E5E5E5"> naft I don't</font>

1003
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:30,259
really know what he means their next

1004
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:32,970

1005
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:36,440
Gonzalo and

1006
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:39,930
TLS light is obviously out to scope for

1007
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,820
happy eyeballs but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got a question from</font>

1008
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:47,910
Dale earlier on about that and I think

1009
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:49,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an interesting path to go down in</font>

1010
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">this working group and see if we can do</font>

1011
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,980
anything anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can irritate and</font>

1012
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:59,520
help us Traverse Alex<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's interesting</font>

1013
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:03,690
and I hear from Roman that people still

1014
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:06,230
don't like TCP and TLS so maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS is</font>

1015
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:09,420
a way to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to explore</font>

1016
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:11,220
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again not related to hype eyeballs I</font>

1017
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:16,710
want to keep hyper happy eyeballs in

1018
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:18,779
scope and the call transaction recover

1019
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:21,090
it well there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see</font>

1020
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,970
constantly now in various networks I'll

1021
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:27,930
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to scope for hype eyeballs but</font>

1022
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:32,098
a very interesting completion of the

1023
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:33,868
outbound project I would say so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I</font>

1024
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:35,310
generally agree with with what you said

1025
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:36,780
there I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially the two things</font>

1026
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:39,960
in this slide is something we might want

1027
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:42,330
to defer until we have some concrete

1028
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,770
proposals on the table but not it's not

1029
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,970
part of the happy eyeballs work right

1030
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,230
there might be some<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting work in</font>

1031
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:49,770
this space and as I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

1032
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:52,020
this you know were these all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

1033
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:53,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">are actually stated in terms of</font>

1034
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:55,020
solutions that I think maybe a bit more

1035
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:57,450
concrete do we want to think about at

1036
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,550
the moment it's you know I would be very

1037
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:00,960
happy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see us putting something in</font>

1038
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:03,510
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg for connection oriented</font>

1039

at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1040
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:10,260
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on UDP and other I think</font>

1041
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:12,720
a document that describes the problem

1042
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">with you to pee and the possible</font>

1043
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:19,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">solutions that we currently have in our</font>

1044
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:19,040
tool set like service route and upon and

1045
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:24,240
finds the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gap and then we can focus on</font>

1046
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:26,190
the gap for a while it will be very

1047
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting discussion but that needs</font>

1048
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,570
some innovation and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cups</font>

1049
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:32,550
of tea so almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a requirements document</font>

1050
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:35,760
that does a survey of potential

1051
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:38,609
solutions then yeah that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that</font>

1052
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,440
fairly easy to come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well okay</font>

1053
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:42,299
and that's something you and help you

1054
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,330
think you could work on together yeah

1055
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonzalo on the rest of the</font>

1056
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:49,610
crew I mean we have to still have

1057
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:51,230
working group in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zip forum so we can</font>

1058
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:52,970
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inspiration from</font>

1059
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:56,930
those guys and wake them up<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

1060
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:58,970
cool I did that sounds good so I'll sit

1061
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:00,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">down with the bend and see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1062
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:03,980
something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to take on as a</font>

1063
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:05,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of milestones then because it</font>

1064
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,460
sounds like there's at least enough

1065
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:09,649
knowledge energy to probably push those

1066
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,810
things forward if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i would like</font>

1067
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:13,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to defer the conversations around the</font>

1071
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,500
along or we have a larger group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

documents in parallel because that's

1075
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,870
just that's never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make progress</font>

1076
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:36,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can add to this that when we found</font>

1077
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:38,960
this this was a lab discovery exhibit

1078
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:40,460
where we create evil networks but during

two different customers and a third one

00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,779
not customer but a third development

1082

users she's actually we're in quite a

1086
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,620
hurry to get some documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i can</font>

1087
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:03,350
feed back to the developers say now do

1088
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:04,970
this by any chance you can you share

1089
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:09,830
whether those developers were<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection</font>

00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:19,280
Jonathan uh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> john maddux i mean i</font>

1094
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the reason why detail s is coming</font>

1095
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,680
up here is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls is despite being</font>

1096
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:26,360
connectionless it's for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these purposes</font>

1097
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,069
connection oriented which so you can do

1098
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:32,000
you can happy eyeballs it by doing the

1099
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:34,580
handshake um so I mean you know so I

1100
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do 0r fut with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls 13 you</font>

1101
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:40,250
don't have to so I think so so that

1102
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,660
gives the architectural benefits of the

1103
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,810
connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people like while still</font>

1104
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:46,220
having a pre handshake that you can do

1105
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:48,670
experimentally as needed and I think

1106
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:50,660
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS is coming up here so I</font>

1107
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:52,400
suspect Romans actually going to say the

1108
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:55,819
same thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm about to ask but the</font>

1109
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,350
you think that the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> architectural</font>

1110
00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:00,170
considerations you're referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to are</font>

1111
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:00,859
actually I mean my<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

1112
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:02,720
it's a

1113
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:05,960
drive to simplicity not necessarily

1114
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,089
wanting to have things in datagrams per

1115
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,279
se oh my i thought it was not yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

1116
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:13,400
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a drive to capacity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1117
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:15,410
thought ah connections yes oh no but

1118
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,089
yeah then the association's is also a

1119
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:18,859
problem well no but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think associations</font>

1120
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:21,440
can keep all their state<font color="#E5E5E5"> client side I</font>

1121
00:56:18,859 --> 00:56:24,200
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know till I smell enough</font>

1122
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,660
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure but I think so that would</font>

1123
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:31,249
surprise me maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

1124
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:34,749
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer that okay Roman it's</font>

1125
00:56:31,249 --> 00:56:37,249
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I would answer as far as</font>

1126
00:56:34,749 --> 00:56:40,450
scalability is comes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls is only</font>

1127
00:56:37,249 --> 00:56:43,189
slightly better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS because</font>

1128
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:45,680
essentially primarily because of the

1129
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:48,589
counters which need to be maintained for

1130
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,058
each message which has been sent both on

1131
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:54,140
the client and the server side so you

1132
00:56:50,059 --> 00:56:58,730
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with fairly frequently updated</font>

1133
00:56:54,140 --> 00:57:00,558
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> its and if there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is any way to</font>

1134
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:02,450
kind of move those counters to work

1135
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,759
either sip sequence numbers or anything

1136
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:08,118
again so it will require some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1137
00:57:04,759 --> 00:57:10,670
