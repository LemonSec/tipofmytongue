00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:54,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need right</font>

because I men including a car hosting a

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:12,360
great but I'm a discussion tomorrow I've

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:39,930
everyone together welcome i'm posting

10
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:43,680
them right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok if the NDF issued at</font>

11
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:47,700
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are just empty</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">alright great then people is a muscle</font>

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,959
yeah before<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your definite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font>

19
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:27,738
half that and yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> push another line</font>

20
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:34,739
across all but thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's me</font>

21
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:40,860
Burton said it doing once<font color="#CCCCCC"> until</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a model</font>

22
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:46,470
how do what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> decide okay by my watch</font>

23
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:49,769
it's time to begin so this is lamps it's

24
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,530
the first meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the group I just</font>

25
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,420
got the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation and what I was</font>

26
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,019
doing here was posting it that has

27
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:03,119
happened so all of the slides have been

28
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:13,799
posted and so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to go with</font>

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:23,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the first thing as always is to go</font>

30
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:26,730
through the note well so we got

31
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:30,299
volunteers on the list for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jabbar scribe</font>

32
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:35,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for minute taking so thank you to</font>

33
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:38,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">those volunteers the other</font>

34
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,290
administrative administrative piece is

35
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,690
the blue sheets they have started around

36
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:48,150
please make sure you sign them here's

37
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:51,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> note well you probably have seen it</font>

38
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:55,139
by now a lot this week please<font color="#CCCCCC"> review it</font>

39
00:03:51,900 --> 00:04:01,980
and if there's an and the rfcs that it

40
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:04,470
points to here's our agenda so we're

41
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,660
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the enhancements to</font>

42
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:12,269
s/mime to support authenticated

43
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:14,430
encryption email addresses that use or

44
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,079
internationalized email addresses in

45
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,048
certificates

46
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,759
and then one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> curdle action items</font>

47
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:27,388
deals with the new curves and how to

48
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,189
carry them in certificates since the

49
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,659
people who understand certificates are

50
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:36,930
in here we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the</font>

51
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:40,289
which object identifiers will be used to

52
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,629
occur in that situation that's the three

53
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:44,930
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end we'll do some</font>

54
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:46,770
calls some homes for<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether some</font>

55
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:53,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">documents should get adopted by the</font>

56
00:04:46,770 --> 00:05:12,930
working group any agenda bashes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Jim</font>

57
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:14,460
Europe step<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 yes this is life for</font>

58
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't recognize me my name</font>

59
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:24,840
is Jim shod<font color="#E5E5E5"> I run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a winery so that's my</font>

60
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:28,099
logo next so there there's currently a

61
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:32,789
private draft up there for the messages

62
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:34,589
it has the updates to say this is how

63
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:36,990
books if you put in authenticated

64
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:40,379
envelopes data here you wrap<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up here</font>

65
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:45,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">on it talks about how you use s/mime</font>

66
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:49,500
capabilities to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I implement this</font>

67
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:54,120
algorithm probably at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> aes GCM</font>

68
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:56,669
and if a sending client sees that you

69
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,219
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> es GCM in your s/mime</font>

70
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,830
capabilities as a list of algorithms you

71
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:03,479
support then it knows that it should use

72
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,750
the authenticated envelopes data

73
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:10,520
structure rather than the envelope data

74
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,949
structure to form the set up being the

75
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:19,680
CMS object for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> message this encrypts</font>

76
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:21,539
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've added AES GCM as a must</font>

77
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,630
algorithm so that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have at</font>

78
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,520
least one algorithm in here to support

79
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,490
I've pulled in all but<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the errata</font>

80
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,310
updates so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all cleaned in</font>

81
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,919
and if what we want to say is all we're

82
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,720
going to do is say this is how we do you

83
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,780
authenticated encryption which is what

84
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,030
the Charter says we can declare<font color="#E5E5E5"> victory</font>

85
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:47,250
go home and be happy at this point in

86
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:49,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">time next slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I didn't quite hit</font>

87
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,199
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I lied on two issues issue</font>

88
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,060
number one what<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of of s/mime is</font>

89
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,220
this right now the document says 3.5

90
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,870
because that's what Shawn Turner wants I

91
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:03,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't care there's an open errata from</font>

92
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Peter Gutman which says oh look at</font>

93
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,380
there's these things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are called</font>

94
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,750
examples in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document and guess what</font>

95
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,479
they actually aren't examples they

96
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,069
aren't formed right they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

97
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,060
do what they're supposed to do so the

98
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:19,830
question is do we modify the titles on

99
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,349
these to say they aren't examples or do

100
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,139
we actually really make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them examples</font>

101
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:29,009
either way works and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

102
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:32,190
matters then there's a set of other

103
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:34,199
issues which we can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms</font>

104
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,740
of if since we have the document open do

105
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,969
we want to fix them basically after

106
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,560
discussion earlier this week with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russ</font>

107
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:45,630
what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do here is I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

108
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fly through these issues i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

109
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">give an opinion and then what we're</font>

110
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,138
going to basically do is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

111
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,830
start feeding these on to the mailing

112
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,710
list at a rate which seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correspond</font>

113
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,210
with discussions and we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

114
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,690
resolve them on the list rather than

115
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,388
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work them out here so things</font>

116
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:09,599
like do we change from 88 syntax quick

117
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,400
jump point of clarification please don't

118
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,340
leave the room without understanding

119
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,049
what the issue is I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

120
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,960
pick among the alternatives today

121
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:25,169
because we only have 60 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um</font>

122
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,150
issue number one do we change from 88

123
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:32,279
syntax of a and went to modern date

124
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:34,949
syntax at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time my I would</font>

125
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,270
say we leave things alone it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks since</font>

126
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,310
we're not actually changing the ace in

127
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,779
one module itself there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> note if</font>

128
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,839
there's no particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason to update</font>

129
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:45,360
the module and do something new

130
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,040
um there may be some additional security

131
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,190
considerations people want to bring up

132
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,920
um I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple that I probably</font>

133
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,890
need to write relative to authenticated

134
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,430
encryption um but other than that I'm

135
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,810
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too sure that we needing special</font>

136
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never what does it mean</font>

137
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:10,189
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples are not real examples</font>

138
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:17,280
um if you try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1 decode the bites</font>

139
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:19,140
they don't they are illustrative

140
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:26,670
examples of what the mine would look

141
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:34,050
like not what s mine looks like I please

142
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:36,150
fix them first one I'm thinking of the

143
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,339
pool guys we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking that two</font>

144
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,199
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now and and and try to</font>

145
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,390
implement and verify that fought against

146
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:47,370
examples and doesn't walk in six ideas

147
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:49,380
as a mess yeah so no this fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> em yeah</font>

148
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,000
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean in point of fact I mean if you</font>

149
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,280
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I mean where we really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,080
today with all our examples if is if you

151
00:09:53,280 --> 00:10:01,370
want examples go to RSC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4134 right</font>

152
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,370
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where real examples are</font>

153
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:07,200
so on the asn.1 version Sean Leonard

154
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,760
says we're updating the table

155
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,950
constraints and information object

156
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,439
classes there for the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1 module</font>

157
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,970
two thousand two plus should be updated

158
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,610
at some point however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's okay</font>

159
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:25,490
for this document to list 88 syntax

160
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:31,529
normative Linton<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

161
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:34,350
next slide most of the people are going

162
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:37,470
to want to say since we got the document

163
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:42,450
open we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just algorithms we want</font>

164
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:45,510
to adjust key sizes there's a whole slew

165
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,700
of questions do do do we def account how

166
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,980
hard do we deprecate some do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

167
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,170
add things other than the minimums that

168
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I currently have in there and I think</font>

169
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,610
that's probably a discussion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

170
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,320
works better if we take them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one into</font>

171
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:08,279
one one-time money at time on the list

172
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:11,190
on next slide since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're adding this we</font>

173
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:17,070
may want to change some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text in</font>

174
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:19,410
section 2.7 in terms of we give

175
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,660
recommendations on what you should do if

176
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,189
you come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a situation where i want</font>

177
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">to send an encrypted message to somebody</font>

178
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:31,079
and I don't know what they do so right

179
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:33,000
now it tends to be if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go all</font>

180
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:35,339
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way down to Triple DES because</font>

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,089
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was supported in some</font>

182
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:42,420
ancient version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> s/mime that's fine it</font>

183
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:45,209
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> choice but it's an</font>

184
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,910
acceptable choice I think we may want to

185
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:49,579
definitely eliminate Triple DES we may

186
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to think about whether we want to</font>

187
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:55,349
make language a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more you</font>

188
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,980
probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about using</font>

189
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:05,339
AES<font color="#CCCCCC"> CBC but here's where you want to say</font>

190
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:11,190
you do um so that's is as guidance it's

191
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:13,500
not armed 2111 language arts a 21-19

192
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:18,949
language this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very hard it's all</font>

193
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,949
shoulds next

194
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:25,310
we talked earlier about header

195
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:29,959
protection with a small group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

196
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:32,149
this week right now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the default</font>

197
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,250
position on this is we're not doing

198
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:36,019
anything in this document if we do

199
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,750
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do something later after</font>

200
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,980
recharter said because this is a hard

201
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,240
issue we don't only want to touch it

202
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:48,649
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now next um actually I think this</font>

203
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,690
one is discouraged by the current

204
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,670
charter language so we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to work</font>

205
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:59,540
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our ID if we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tackle this</font>

206
00:12:52,670 --> 00:13:02,959
one I think we're updating email

207
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:06,370
addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificates to use the</font>

208
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,388
international mail at email addresses

209
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:12,949
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> question do we need to</font>

210
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:15,110
update the SYM certificate document to

211
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:18,920
talk about international email addresses

212
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,690
as well right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not</font>

213
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,880
clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether the Charter says do that</font>

214
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:28,699
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to do that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the Charter</font>

215
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:30,439
shows do that that's my reading um if we

216
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:32,359
open up that document you know but it

217
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,730
will also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithms and</font>

218
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,949
key sizes arguments for that draft that

219
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,990
we do for the message draft well

220
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,209
actually that's what that's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

221
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,589
reason to do it it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> silly for</font>

222
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:45,709
those two documents not to have

223
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:48,319
agreement right I mean my default

224
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:53,949
positions we should do it it's just it

225
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:56,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't immediately clear ah next okay</font>

226
00:13:53,949 --> 00:14:01,069
are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other issues that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

227
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:03,469
know of that needed need to be discussed

228
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:06,219
or any of these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i've covered</font>

229
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,220
unclear

230
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,160
student viral and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna clarity kind</font>

231
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,140
of thing so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

232
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,310
changes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could suggest to make to</font>

233
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,890
the documents which would be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

234
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,030
good improvements to the documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

235
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,699
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to check that we're all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

236
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">same page</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accept that we there's</font>

237
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,640
only a point in doing those if

238
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,070
implementations are liable to follow

239
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,150
them so even though there's probably a

240
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,400
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things we'd all like to the</font>

241
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,750
documents to say but that we won't have

242
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,650
a chance this time because people

243
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,910
actually probably won't make such

244
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:43,569
changes yeah I've got some nice big

245
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,250
changes I'd love to do which I look at

246
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,250
them and say they're not realistic yeah

247
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:53,040
so I just was maybe a lot of that

248
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,040
unfortunately I'm thats reality yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

249
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:01,150
hi sean leonard<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should update</font>

250
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,980
s mine to discuss ai ai also update s

251
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:06,130
mom to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the inner s my own</font>

252
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,140
content which is binary clear clean has

253
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:11,650
or ought to have utf-8 hitters

254
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:14,980
consistent with the AI and should there

255
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:21,400
be s/mime company compatibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> OID for</font>

256
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:24,810
EA<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just topic I think about Alexa do</font>

257
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,810
you have any advice on that last one

258
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:37,810
well you weren't paying attention yeah

259
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:40,630
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hear updating the header</font>

260
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,250
should it with utf8 yeah two questions

261
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,590
one should we update the headers to the

262
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:48,310
inner mine content and should there be

263
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:53,160
an s mom capability<font color="#CCCCCC"> oid for EA I so the</font>

264
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:58,119
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> place I can think of in naga sub</font>

265
00:15:53,160 --> 00:16:00,459
822 headers<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for inside of a message /</font>

266
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,850
or RFC 822 is the only place I can think

267
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,210
of immediately where you would have

268
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,210
utf-8 headers

269
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,279
yes but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have arbitrary nesting</font>

270
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:21,660
so it screams you talking about any

271
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,179
level is john devine was saying that it

272
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,699
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> messaged global not message RFC</font>

273
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:29,279
822 but you can have nesting it in a you

274
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:32,790
can still construct and have at at lower

275
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,529
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nesting anyway so so what</font>

276
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:39,389
you're saying is by changing the

277
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:44,329
reference from message RCA to 22 message

278
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:44,329
global we would get that for free I

279
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:49,290
think dance is probably yes but I think

280
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:51,689
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to think about all the</font>

281
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:56,730
modifications and other any restrictions

282
00:16:51,689 --> 00:17:01,608
about let's check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out yeah because</font>

283
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it's that easy we should do it yeah</font>

284
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay any other questions um who's taking</font>

285
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:12,629
minutes make sure you grab that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one for</font>

286
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:18,949
me please thank you all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

287
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:18,949
Jim wait to get your slides up here

288
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:40,299
hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right my name is waitron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

289
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,490
doing this work with Alexei Melnikov so

290
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:46,030
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about internationalized email</font>

291
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:50,260
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> in x.509 certificates next</font>

292
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:55,299
slide so what's being done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this draft</font>

293
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:58,179
is changing or creating a new name type

294
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:02,010
for email addresses that would represent

295
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:07,210
the email address as utf-8 as opposed to

296
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:11,110
the current RFC a 22 name which is in

297
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:14,350
ascii and so this allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the local</font>

298
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:17,590
park in particular to be utf-8 this

299
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:21,158
dress also<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifies that the domain</font>

300
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:24,428
should be you label or a ski but

301
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:28,179
excludes intentionally a labels and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

302
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:32,620
can get into that later it's also says

303
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:37,030
that this will be included as part of

304
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:38,379
other names as opposed to being part of

305
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:44,678
general names and I'll get into that in

306
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:47,730
a moment next slide so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get</font>

307
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:51,669
into some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the interesting sort of</font>

308
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:54,460
choice points and these could be

309
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:56,110
potential also open issues but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try</font>

310
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,760
to describe some of the reasoning behind

311
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:04,510
this and first with regards to other

312
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:08,379
name versus say adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 to general</font>

313
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:10,000
names so the let me first get into the

314
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">downside so other names means that</font>

315
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,659
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be potential overhead</font>

316
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is going to be a new object</font>

317
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:22,360
identifier added and this will slightly

318
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:25,450
increase the size of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> certificate the</font>

319
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,360
reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason for going for</font>

320
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:32,470
other names is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the plate</font>

321
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:35,889
the the extension point in these name

322
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:38,289
types and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of assumption</font>

323
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:43,270
that implementation seems to have made

324
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:45,760
about this so the types in general names

325
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,220
seem to be hard-coded at least in the

326
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,370
places

327
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,820
look like I've looked in openssl and I a

328
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:55,039
comparison<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> general names is basically</font>

329
00:19:52,820 --> 00:20:00,289
just a switch statement with all the

330
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:03,080
currently enumerated names and there

331
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:06,200
isn't a default that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says okay here's</font>

332
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,780
what you do if if you know you find

333
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you you know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

334
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">piece</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at it doesn't seem like</font>

335
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:12,679
good break but I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine and then</font>

336
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,059
many other places this has been

337
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:19,190
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there could be some</font>

338
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:20,809
amount of breakage so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font>

339
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this</font>

340
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:29,240
overhead hit and just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know go for</font>

341
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:32,389
compatibility then the other point

342
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:37,460
design choice point is basically name

343
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:40,340
constraints so smtp utf-8<font color="#E5E5E5"> name the</font>

344
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,600
stress says that name constraints on it

345
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,730
with regards to other name types such as

346
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,240
distinguished names or RCA to two names

347
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:53,539
that it does not specify a restriction

348
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,330
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other name constraints I'm sorry</font>

349
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:59,000
a name constraints of smtp utf-8 name

350
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:02,049
does not constrain the other

351
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,130
distinguished name or RCA to two names

352
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:12,650
and that was an intentional decision so

353
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:15,500
that the having these dependencies could

354
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:18,530
cause confusion and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inflammations</font>

355
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:22,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this draft tries to avoid that</font>

356
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:24,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">however this will mean that then if you</font>

357
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:27,408
want to have named constraint

358
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:30,110
potentially a for international email

359
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:32,240
addresses or just pure<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASCII local part</font>

360
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:35,059
addresses you'll have to then have the

361
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,320
name constraint with both<font color="#E5E5E5"> rc8 you to</font>

362
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:41,570
name as well as smtp utf-8 name which

363
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,510
could potentially increase the size of

364
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,399
and usually these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> done you know in</font>

365
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:49,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the CA certificates that it would cause</font>

366
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:54,230
some expansion there potentially next

367
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:58,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide okay just um talking about the</font>

368
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,929
version history and the closed issues so

369
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,330
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trastevere one</font>

370
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:07,070
basically this was about getting

371
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:08,449
feedback that we ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have or</font>

372
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:12,830
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should try to minimize the choices</font>

373
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:15,100
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain encoding and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the worry</font>

374
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:19,789
with that implementations may get

375
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:21,980
additional choices wrong and then also a

376
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:23,840
request to minimize the conversions

377
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,759
between the different types when doing

378
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,330
the canonicalization safer comparison

379
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:31,970
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide language in the</font>

380
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:36,428
draft for specifying name constraints

381
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:39,559
and comparisons for version 02 and 03

382
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:41,389
there's significant amount of language

383
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:46,340
and specification cleanup particularly

384
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:49,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unicode you know changing the</font>

385
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:55,639

00:22:55,639 --> 00:23:04,490
the type specification and also cleanup

00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:08,090
of the references for the various

389
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:14,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">internationalization RF seeds there is</font>

390
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:19,959
also a request to to restrict<font color="#CCCCCC"> SMTP utf-8</font>

391
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:22,879
name to non-ascii local parts and then

392
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:28,220
essentially reserved RFC 822 name for a

393
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:33,529
ski local parts so you can see then this

394
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:36,440
would then have like you know cause this

395
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:39,649
name constraint issue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be slightly</font>

396
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">more important there's also a request</font>

397
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:46,928
for additional line comparison language

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:49,340
clean up next<font color="#E5E5E5"> leg and then inversion 04</font>

399
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:52,190
there's language cleanup and a diagram

400
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:56,509
added to help illustrate the name

401
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:59,899
constraint and its interactions with you

402
00:23:56,509 --> 00:24:05,509
know between<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMTP utf-8 name and RC</font>

403
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:10,008
eight you to name um so for the

404
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:13,190
deployment situation basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

405
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:13,910
contacted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> openssl folks they say</font>

406
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,860
that it

407
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,590
should be very doable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get something</font>

408
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,689
added for this it would take them about

409
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:25,520
a year because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a normal release</font>

410
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:28,280
cycle for doing updates I have for we

411
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,720
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talked to the CAS about this</font>

412
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,320
but then you know this has not been

413
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,690
published we do have or I have contacts

414
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chrome security team to have contacts</font>

415
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:43,030
with the CIA industry that could help

416
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:48,460
get this deployed and that concludes

417
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,460
this presentation are there questions

418
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,630
that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> given it from inside seeker one</font>

419
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:03,230
question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what happens if we</font>

420
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:04,880
have both RFC 822<font color="#E5E5E5"> antes especially in</font>

421
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,430
the security because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the contrary</font>

422
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,490
sections doesn't say anything about this

423
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">having no both of these which in some</font>

424
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,690
cases for<font color="#CCCCCC"> action ipsec their matching</font>

425
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:17,510
you know identities and if you some

426
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,100
applications take you know RFC 822 part

427
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:22,270
of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and some applications taking out</font>

428
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,860
the utf-8 version of it it might cause

429
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,879
security issues so I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer</font>

430
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one because I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer</font>

431
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">isn't 50 to 80 yeah basically it says</font>

432
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,560
all of the name forms that appear are

433
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,800
bound to the public key yeah but I'm

434
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,960
yeah okay so I mean yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was meaning</font>

435
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,580
that if you have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> email if I have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

436
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,640
basic confessing to have an email

437
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,919
address mm-hmm it's a it doesn't say

438
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,710
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> in going to be in RFC 822 for a</font>

439
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,270
part of that it doesn't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in that</font>

440
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,460
utf-8 part it's outside an email address

441
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,930
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to match it probably in</font>

442
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,620
after T sub supposed to match it

443
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:59,810
involved feels great and now if the ca

444
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,290
allows wait a minute that part goes into

445
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:06,230
the document the search document arm

446
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:11,720
that Jim said we now need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update all</font>

447
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:14,240
right that's where it is Jim shot

448
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,590
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one other deployment</font>

449
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,950
consideration you haven't listed here

450
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:20,600
which is in some respects harder than

451
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:23,810
the CAS in some respects is easier than

452
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,189
cas and that is you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the</font>

453
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,678
people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually creating</font>

454
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,659
certificate request

455
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:35,389
okay I'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that feedback ah good a</font>

456
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:38,389
good point sean leonard an observation

457
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:40,158
it is strange at<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 provides to</font>

458
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:42,769
extension points for extending general

459
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,109
names other name with an open type table

460
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:47,479
is the older one more likely to be

461
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:50,749
widely deployed other name is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

462
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:55,849
compatible with a sm 188 syntax compared

463
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:59,320
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ellipses construct okay I'll take</font>

464
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:04,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so he's agreeing with you I think</font>

465
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:20,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay any other questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks way</font>

466
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:29,799
Jim we now a slight digression into the

467
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:33,109
curdle meeting okay next time ah so

468
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:35,809
right um if you remember with the slides

469
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:41,029
are again so so basically we start with

470
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:44,479
um just<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementing zobelle if we're</font>

471
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:48,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at EDD SA and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ed diffie-hellman</font>

472
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:49,129
um there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some simple things that we</font>

473
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:51,859
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're making</font>

474
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:53,149
decisions private keys are always octet

475
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:56,899
strings in this case they aren't

476
00:27:53,149 --> 00:28:01,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce a public</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> King public key is</font>

477
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:03,978
also not pestering however the format of

478
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:06,739
what's in that octet string is different

479
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:13,460
if you're doing ed the sa vs is if

480
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:16,729
you're doing EDC ed ed cdh get my kit my

481
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:18,590
yeah um that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of the</font>

482
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:21,619
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to make sure we do is we</font>

483
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:23,478
identify what which one of those which

484
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:25,789
size were dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> private key</font>

485
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:28,609
which whether it is for diffie-hellman

486
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:30,349
or whether it's the signatures um and

487
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:33,499
there's also question whether there's

488
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:34,999
other potential dippy home and key

489
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:39,710
agreement algorithms that may show up

490
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:44,510
again in the future the original ed the

491
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:47,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">H document did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about mqv it's just</font>

492
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:53,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">not clear how much m QV is actually used</font>

493
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:55,330
in anything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world next so</font>

494
00:28:53,059 --> 00:29:00,080
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through Simon's document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

495
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:04,210
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> table of what i</font>

496
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,500
came up with where things go and what

497
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:11,480
boys would be put in two different

498
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,740
places um it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

499
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,980
think actually works with what we

500
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,020
currently have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did call out each of</font>

501
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> courage separately because one of</font>

502
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,320
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been made clear by</font>

503
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,049
the people who have wrote the e dds a

504
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,389
document is that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure we</font>

505
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:29,679
keep the pre hash and the non pre hash

506
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:32,750
keys separate because otherwise you can

507
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,779
make it there are attacks between<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

508
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:41,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">if used them on the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on both of them</font>

509
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:47,539
um so Jim what I think you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said was</font>

510
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:50,928
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same private key with</font>

511
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:54,919
both pre hash and not pre hash there's

512
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:56,450
some attacks correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I it was it</font>

513
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:01,580
was a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> convoluted so I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

514
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:04,549
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that the document originally</font>

515
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:07,789
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> an enumeration in in terms of</font>

516
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:10,070
looking at the cigna the public the

517
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:11,600
signature algorithms on there was

518
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,250
suggested that basically we should

519
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably go to a noite to mix things</font>

520
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:21,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">life simpler arm but well but we kind of</font>

521
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:26,179
basically have looked at this and said

522
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:28,039
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun okay next slide so if</font>

523
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:30,350
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this based upon what we actually</font>

524
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:34,429
currently have and do all the logical

525
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:38,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">extensions um obviously we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kill</font>

526
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:42,409
the ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> ec public key portion out of all</font>

527
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:45,020
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature algorithms but it's a</font>

528
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:47,270
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit clearer moving things</font>

529
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,908
straight across so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the same always</font>

530
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">are showing up straight across in a</font>

531
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:53,570
little bit better fashion than what they

532
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:57,920
are otherwise

533
00:30:53,570 --> 00:31:02,389
um we<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I sighs exchanged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mail with</font>

534
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:06,380
Kenny um and he basically says we really

535
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:09,670
ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be removing the I Dec public</font>

536
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:14,210
key from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first two lines as well</font>

537
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:18,100
there are any known attacks that we

538
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:22,040
actually currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> have but historic</font>

539
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:24,219
evidence suggests that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

540
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks may not come in the future</font>

541
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:29,720
the tighter you bind the key to an

542
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:33,260
algorithm the better off you are um and

543
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:36,260
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually at you know a plight</font>

544
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:38,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lee cleaner one then the one of the</font>

545
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:43,100
current draft however if we go to the

546
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:46,030
next slide we come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that's</font>

547
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:49,939
actually in some respects even clean up

548
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:51,710
because it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any of the if it</font>

549
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:57,380
were reducing everything down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

550
00:31:51,710 --> 00:32:00,170
single oi<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so it makes things really</font>

551
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,930
clear it's the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same value in all</font>

552
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,220
three columns you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever have to deal</font>

553
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:06,050
with one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you don't you are</font>

554
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,410
guaranteed that you'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

555
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:16,730
confusion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing next</font>

556
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:19,040
slide so real fast review of the

557
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:24,500
benefits between the last two proposals

558
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:25,820
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> there arm the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding is is more</font>

559
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,490
or less six of one half a dozen the

560
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:33,290
other is that both easy to do they're

561
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:35,120
both reasonably unwell understood there

562
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:37,460
are some potential issues in terms of

563
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,580
publishing and negotiation of algorithms

564
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,890
um I can't come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with anything</font>

565
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:46,210
specific but that was my one worry about

566
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:49,070
it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be easier to say I</font>

567
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:56,030
make currently what you say is I'm going

568
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:58,879
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> negotiate an ecdsa algorithm I'm not</font>

569
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:03,620
specifying I'm negotiating<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ecdsa</font>

570
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,970
for specific key with it with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

571
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,209
bend with the Benjamin proposal

572
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,700
basically we're when you do that ago

573
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:12,370
you're negotiating the algorithm and the

574
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,049
key at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time um there was</font>

575
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,870
actually somebody on the list i cannot

576
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:18,940
remember who it was who basically says

577
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:21,639
the fact that you can't negotiate them

578
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,289
separately is really good because he

579
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,020
when he goes off and looks at the

580
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:27,309
certificate transparency stuff he can't

581
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,658
figure out whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not he's going to</font>

582
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">support that algorithm until he's</font>

583
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:32,919
actually grabbed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the certificate and</font>

584
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">done all of that work because he doesn't</font>

585
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,370
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the actual curve is he's</font>

586
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:41,379
playing with he<font color="#E5E5E5"> just knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it is</font>

587
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:44,830
ecdsa there is a possibility as future

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:47,770
algorithms come along<font color="#CCCCCC"> if in if you've</font>

589
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:50,230
used the the middle proposal you just

590
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:52,779
define the curve<font color="#E5E5E5"> Voyager done we use the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Benjamin proposal you have to define all</font>

592
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:59,799
four of those or all four of those guys

593
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:04,899
all three new oils so you have to have

594

one<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you see da e</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cdh you have to</font>

00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:11,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">want we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have one for EDD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SI if you have</font>

596
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:14,050
one for EDD SI prehaps it's not that

597
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:15,839
hard to get eggs it's just potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get them through</font>

599
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:25,690
all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CAS them than it is otherwise</font>

600
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:28,179
misuse of curves we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that</font>

601
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:30,040
and said it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

602
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:34,089
either one of them gives us a better

603
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,619
answer than the other one but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font>

604
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:37,509
of the group of us that met at the

00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:40,629
beginning of the week we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all basically</font>

606
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:42,820
boiled down to let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use the</font>

607
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:45,569
Benjamin proposal it's simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well</font>

608
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:48,010
understood and I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's any</font>

609
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:54,190
there's no problems that we know of that

<font color="#E5E5E5">would arise from happiness Shawn Turner</font>

as an author of 5480 I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with</font>

612
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:02,320
David Benn's proposal i really i really

613
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:10,850
never liked the sexy stuff that got

614

<font color="#E5E5E5">adopt next slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

615
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:17,990
part of the sexy stuff that got adopted

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you really want to shoot maybe one</font>

617
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,339
symmetric key is actually essentially

618
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:25,310
which you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peek</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ses-8 it's been</font>

619
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,630
updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that the public key field is</font>

down there<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the bottom other than that</font>

621
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:33,710
is essentially the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as being a</font>

624
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:43,399
was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left hand that you do when</font>

625
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:45,710
symmetric key you put that integer or

626
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,650
that price<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that private key structure</font>

627
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:52,040
into the octet string you're done if you

628
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:54,260
do ecdsa<font color="#CCCCCC"> or e</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cdh today what you do is</font>

629
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,660
you put the easy prey private key in

630
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> field and look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the nice</font>

631
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:03,850
duplications you have there so basically

632
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:07,400
what we want to do is for the the

633
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:09,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Montgomery curve for all these new</font>

634
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,890
curves we want to say that the private

635
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,779
key is going to be an octet string and

636
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:17,629
you put the octet string into that

637
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,700
private key field in the PKS a blob<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

638
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:22,070
you're done you know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

639
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:30,560
worry about whether this matches that

640
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:36,140
and so forth as you go along next do

641
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:38,210
people want to commit so there's at

642
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,759
least one curdle working group chair

643
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:44,000
good here no that's that's what the next

644
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,400
deck well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think some words</font>

645
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,860
about whatever we say here how does that

646
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:54,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback work to the document authors</font>

647
00:36:50,860 --> 00:37:02,120
will direct them to take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as gospel</font>

648
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:03,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay has Simon agreed to update the</font>

649
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:09,700
document based on what we said is really

650
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:13,810
what I meant to say yes only a question

651
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:17,299
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OID for EDD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> essay</font>

652
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:21,210
in a signature block so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

653
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:24,270
distinguish between<font color="#E5E5E5"> 255 19 and 44</font>

654
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:27,060
8h get annoyed are always those

655
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,980
different times<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe you look is</font>

656
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the operation is basically you know</font>

657
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:35,130
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what goes in the signature peel</font>

658
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,600
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 oils for each for each</font>

659
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:42,450
curve not for each algorithm Dara

660
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:49,170
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for each curve algorithm</font>

661
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:51,810
pairing from sean leonard so you're

662
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying the ones one asymmetric private</font>

663
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:58,920
key the octet string contains ec private

664
00:37:54,810 --> 00:38:00,120
key is that right no that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

665
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,700
saying that's what is that's what

666
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:06,589
happens with today with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

667
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:12,149
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just hold an octet string I</font>

668
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:14,310
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> back in front</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have them</font>

669
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,510
mqv stuff on here we're not proposing to

670
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,180
allocate oh it's for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or I'm not</font>

671
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:21,060
proposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> allocates for MTV is a thought</font>

672
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,339
experiment as things go on it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

673
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,650
the questions was if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it what</font>

674
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,120
happens sure good that we're not

675
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposing to do stuff for undefined</font>

676
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:35,819
stuff shawn turner says it came from

677
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:38,460
openssl he was just reflecting what

678
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:42,090
appeared to be reality but it was ok

679
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:44,960
with swapping it to be simpler right<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

680
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:48,780
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be clear we are not changing</font>

681
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,110
any of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIST curve private key</font>

682
00:38:48,780 --> 00:39:06,150
structures we're only doing this for the

683
00:38:52,110 --> 00:39:09,630
new CF RG curves questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

684
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:11,760
take a quick home at this point does

685
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,130
this group want to recommend to curdle

686
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:20,010
that the david benjamin proposed will be

687
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:21,570
adopted um yes hum no dick<font color="#E5E5E5"> hum now if</font>

688
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,870
you think this group should recommend

689
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:27,440
the david benjamin proposal to the

690
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,440
curdle group

691
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:35,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">how now if you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this group should</font>

692
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,769
not make that recommendation thank you

693
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:45,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so those were the presentations we</font>

694
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:52,390
had planned for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting now come the</font>

695
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:57,410
homes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are about document adoption</font>

696
00:39:52,390 --> 00:40:02,808
so we have two drafts before us<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

697
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:08,690
first one the gym I'm sorry yes i know i

698
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:10,579
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no slides system we have two that</font>

699
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:16,670
we're looking at adopting as<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

700
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:18,680
group at this point jim's wants to

701
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:24,460
correct me which one we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font>

702
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:24,460
copy yet of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated search right</font>

703
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:36,348
can't can't adopt something we haven't

704
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:38,989
had had opportunity to read yet so once

705
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:40,220
coming to we have in hand the two we

706
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:44,089
have in hand the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to talk</font>

707
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:47,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">about so the first one is the one that</font>

708
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:51,170
Jim presented about message which is

709
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:52,819
basically the update of the what the sm

710
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:58,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm working group had called the message</font>

711
00:40:52,819 --> 00:41:01,038
spec and it is to incorporate what is

712
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:06,400
