00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,549
hello I'm Michael Abramson<font color="#CCCCCC"> and working</font>

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,310
with the sis repo project we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font>

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make services and applications</font>

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,340
manageable using<font color="#CCCCCC"> net company yang</font>

5
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:26,410
historically this has been mostly an

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> service provider thing with</font>

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,070
SNMP and so on and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,739
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that everything can be</font>

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,360
manageable and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> creating the base</font>

10
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:38,769
infrastructure to do this with a

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:42,519
datastore<font color="#CCCCCC"> netcom server that others can</font>

12
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:45,400
integrate with hi I'm drove from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Huawei</font>

13
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:48,580
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT of 96 hackathon we worked on</font>

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,400
pc based central control and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN</font>

15
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,559
environment using<font color="#CCCCCC"> onus controller we</font>

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,799
worked on if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> p sub can be used as an</font>

17
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,839
SBI and used as a central controller

18
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,909
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> labeled forwarding instruction</font>

19
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:04,298
being passed from the controller to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

20
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:06,189
device so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ITF p sub protocol we</font>

21
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:08,380
try to achieve this we worked on

22
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:10,600
extension to making the synchronization

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,149
and the security better for this

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,330
protocol so hello my name is carefully

25
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,030
stir I work for cisco and for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FDI</font>

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">own installation projects and I was the</font>

27
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,070
champion this time for the ILA working

28
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,260
group in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning we wanted to show</font>

29
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,600
a little bit what were VPP was the

30
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,580
vector packet processor was and so we

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,759
found this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ila draft that we propose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

32
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,130
implement and actually from this small

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,070
team other people joined in like Tom

34
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,890
Herbert<font color="#E5E5E5"> the author of the aisle a draft</font>

35
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,750
in the working group and other people as

36
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,990
well from different<font color="#CCCCCC"> horizons companies</font>

37
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:49,270
etc and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we work together or envy on VPP</font>

38
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,970
implementing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> la and we did that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

39
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we did testings and we obtained</font>

40
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,640
pretty good performances and we did

41
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,810
interoperability tests with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Linux</font>

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,810
reference implementation of high life

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,959
here are the pizza bites of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF in</font>

44
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Berlin to show off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sasori bow where we</font>

45
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,340
enabled<font color="#E5E5E5"> netcom yang management of</font>

46
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,800
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we can read operational</font>

47
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">states and right configuration so we're</font>

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,769
showing up here we can read a

49
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,840
temperature sensor<font color="#CCCCCC"> eating at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of</font>

50
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:27,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the egg and we can turn on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and off a</font>

51
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,880
relay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show it shows an LED going on</font>

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,599
and off we run these napkins and yang

53
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,870
commands we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> with two projects</font>

54
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,030
pc-based central control and actn which

55
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,099
is abstraction and control of traffic

56
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,019
engineering networks both of these work

57
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:44,829
is being carried out in pc working group

58
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:47,750
and T's working group so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we developed</font>

59
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:51,470
various extensions on owners controller

60
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:54,260
which anyway uses pc as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as VG pls</font>

61
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,599
and yang based work that the ITF is

62
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,840
doing so over which we extended that

63
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:02,959
work we did talks with customers like

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,150
Telefonica worked on in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

65
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes to idea of documents one of our</font>

66
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,359
documents was experimental track we

67
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,458
thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to adapt</font>

68
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:12,620
so we moved it to standards track make

69
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,079
changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document based on the</font>

70
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,450
results that we had at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hackathon so</font>

71
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:19,819
right now behind me we are doing some

72
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,429
demos of the results that we did at the

73
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:24,619
hackathon we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two problem statements</font>

74
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,410
that we tracked one was using<font color="#CCCCCC"> P sub</font>

75
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,420
security enhancing it to TLS as well as

76
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,030
worrying about synchronization between

77
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,280
the pc controller and devices and how to

78
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,920
enhance that as well as we were working

79
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">on her</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i key of controllers so there is</font>

80
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">a work that's Paul actn so we are</font>

81
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,920
showing how a CDN can be achieved using

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:49,040
ITF protocols like<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc and bgp so we are</font>

83
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to to show two things here</font>

84
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,090
dpv which is the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> we developed</font>

85
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:58,629
on the FDI yo project vvb and on the

86
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">other side ITF technology which is ila</font>

87
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:03,858
we are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I la works</font>

88
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,839
that we could implement it thats it's

89
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:09,430
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good technology or actually</font>

90
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,430
at least a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting point</font>

91
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,949
you
