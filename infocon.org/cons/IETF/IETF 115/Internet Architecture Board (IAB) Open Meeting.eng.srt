8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,539
meeting hosted by the IAB but we're

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,820
still part of the ietf and so the ietf

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,220
note well applies which means everything

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,660
you're saying here is a contribution to

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,120
the ietf and you should note well all

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,059
the policies and IPR regulations we have

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,980
and we should also be friendly to each

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,579
other which we always are right now this

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,140

version if you want um so we have a

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,699
record that you've been here which is

22
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,640
important for this organization to work

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,000
um we do require masks except you're

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,880
actively speaking at the mic or um in

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,880
front here and we do require to be nice

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,200
it's on the slide once again because

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,420
it's so important

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,840
this session will be recorded and will

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,700
be live streamed so we're exciting

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,380
what is this meeting about right this is

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,360
a good opportunity for us the IB to tell

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,400
you what we're doing but it's also a

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,960
great opportunity to get imported from

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,180
you on our work so that's the main point

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,420
here

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,860
um if you if you're too shy to go to my

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,240
clan today and tell us what we're doing

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,280

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,200
and there are different ways to reach us

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,299
you can reach and each of us

41
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,280
individually you can reach me at the IB

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,439
chair but you can also send us email to

43
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,180
the IMB mailing list and but be aware

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,640
it's not only the IB on that list a few

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,740
more people so that's listed here if you

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,479
want a more public discussion especially

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,100
on architectural

48
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,659
um considerations we have the

49
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,360
architecture discuss list

50
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,399
um and we have lists for each program

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,619
which is only one at this point that you

52
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,319
can engage with and if especially one

53
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,760
important role we're having is liaison

54
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,680
coordination so if you have a question

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,720
about liaison they have a special

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,700
mailing list for that so feel free to

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,619
reach us on any of these ways

58
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,800
foreign

59
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,720
the exciting part of the meeting we have

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,420
a few updates that in order to keep you

61
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,400
up to date with what we're doing and one

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,900
thing we are doing is we do happen to

63
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,180
publish documents from time to time and

64
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,340
we happen and we published just two

65
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,459
documents which are both reports to um

66
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,860
recent uh workshops

67
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,720
so one is for the eight Workshop that we

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,040
had last year

69
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,440
and the other one is the workshop for

70
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,360
measuring Network quality for end users

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,280
we reported in both of these workshops

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,900
really nice workshops a lot of good

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,400
contributions and now you have to report

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,080
the final version of it out there as RC

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
um we're working also on documents that

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,739
are supposed to provide architecture

77
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,140
guidance and we have two documents that

78
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,900
are basically ready for publication

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,560
um

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,900
the past English collaboration document

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,920
already

82
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,720
um got a round of last round of

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,280
community feedback so this one is

84
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,319
actually ready to go and you will soon

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,819
see an RFC

86
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,099
and the protocol maintenance we will do

87
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,800
another round or like a final round of

88
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,720
community feedback but there was a lot

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,819
of work on this document lately so the

90
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,560
IB thinks this document is in very good

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,060
shape

92
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,440
um and you will see an email about this

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,300
soon or maybe it's already out I'm not

94
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,099
sure

95
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,920
and um just very quickly quickly we also

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,659
have um two documents that we're

97
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,780
considering to adopt in the IAB

98
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,980
um one document we uh we already uh had

99
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,959
a presentation last iob open meeting so

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,340
you should be aware this is the

101
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,500
minimization document we've got very

102
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,420
good feedback after the session there

103
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,819
has been a vision and mainly we're also

104
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,099
clarifying what the difference to the

105
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,099
system privacy considerations and

106
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,659
because that also talks about data

107
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,340
minimization but we believe there's more

108
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,720
to say here

109
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,760
um so that's the status of that document

110
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,620
and the other one is brand new and I

111
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,880
will not tell you much about it because

112
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,199
we have a short presentation later

113
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,720
okay

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
um besides documents um we also have

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,180
this tool of technical programs that we

116
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,620
use to do work and engage with the

117
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,699
community

118
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,419
and currently we we just closed recently

119
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,800
and that was also discussed at the last

120
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,259
IB open meeting we closed the Model T

121
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,000
working group

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,680
um it doesn't mean there's no work to be

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,440
done and we just think the work needs to

124
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,840
be done in the ietf but you can still

125
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,639
use the architecture discussion and if

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,620
you have anything to discuss in that

127
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,960
relation

128
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,540
foreign

129
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,919
active program we have is the EDM

130
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,440
program that program didn't have a

131
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,540
meeting since the last ITF meeting and

132
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,520
but there's the progress and mainly

133
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,100
their focus was on this protocol that I

134
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,600
was just talking on this document I was

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,919
just talking about about protocol

136
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,220
maintenance so that's the main focus

137
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,540
um but you can also see the current

138
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,000
status about other things that that will

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,919
be or are in scope for this program and

140
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,320
based on GitHub issues so if you're

141
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
interested in in these things please

142
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,919
look at the issues please comment please

143
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,860
subscribe to the mailing list or talk to

144
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,400
the chairs nobody call them leads which

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,979
is David and Tommy David was just waving

146
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,720
okay

147
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,259
um

148
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,020
liaison updates uh we will have a

149
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,940
slightly longer update coming up next

150
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,419
from Russ about uh IEEE this is

151
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,680
something we started the last meeting

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
that we actually asked one of our lizard

153
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,919
coordinators to talk about the

154
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,620
respective organization

155
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,240
um because we hope that is helpful to

156
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,800
the community

157
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,300
um and then just like one little news

158
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,820
here uh we one of our tasks is also to

159
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,759
maintain and Lease our managers so we

160
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
had Alison Menken who served us as a

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,520
result manager for a very long time

162
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,740
and great thanks for that and she asked

163
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,840
us to step down and so we had to find a

164
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,780
replacement and so Warren is happily

165
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,639
taking this up thank you thank you to

166
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,660
both Ellison Edward

167
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,419
foreign

168
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,919
okay the other thing we're doing is

169
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,259
workshops and we actually have something

170
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,800
coming up

171
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,300
um the next Workshop we are I'm going to

172
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,560
take you just missed the deadline

173
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,380
yesterday but if you actually want to

174
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,539
contribute and maybe there's still a

175
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,300
tense I don't know talk to to Yari and

176
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,120
the other program committee members

177
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,500
um but this Workshop is definitely

178
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,960
coming up uh beginning of December first

179
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,120
week of December and this will be an

180
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,759
online Workshop um so the the sessions

181
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,380
are not fixed yet it depends on the

182
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,020
participants and the focus is really on

183
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,759
the environmental impact of the internet

184
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,280
to try to get an assessment or a better

185
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,840
understanding like how to even measure

186
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,299
that and what that means in very short

187
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,940
thank you

188
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,960
okay that was the quick update

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,960
um and we will next go to Russ except

190
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,759
somebody has an agenda patch that would

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,539
be your opportunity

192
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,780
okay got my slides oh yes

193
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,819
uh hi I'm here to talk about the

194
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,880
relationship between uh ITF and IEEE 802

195
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,719
next slide please

196
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,460
so this relationship

197
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,440
um is has been going on for a long long

198
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,800
time obviously but uh it got written

199
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,720
down uh in RFC 7241 which is actually an

200
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,660
update to an earlier RFC but it

201
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,699
describes the way that the two

202
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,120
organizations by Triple E project data 2

203
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,520
and the ITF

204
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,240
um choose to cooperate

205
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,580
um the document was collaboratively

206
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,419
developed from both people in the IEEE

207
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,940
802 leadership and from the ITF

208
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,958
leadership

209
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,320
and it guides uh the way that we do

210
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,940
coordination today

211
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,660
next slide

212
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,640
so each uh

213
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,740
meeting cycle both the ITF and the IEEE

214
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,100
802 each meet three times a year

215
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,940
and so between each of the meetings so

216
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,420
roughly February June and October

217
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,060
um we will have kind of a coordination

218
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,880
call to find out what's going on with

219
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,740
the other uh group

220
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,399
so 802 will present the things that they

221
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,920
are considering beginning work on these

222
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,260
are called project approval requests in

223
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,820
their terminology

224
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,000
and we will talk about the boff sessions

225
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,440
that are coming up

226
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,140
just basically to make sure that each of

227
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,779
us is aware of what's going on in the

228
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,560
other and not surprise each other

229
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,620
um and then we have a list of things

230
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,779
that are of mutual interest where we

231
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,019
want to collaborate so each time a

232
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,500
working group is formed or each time

233
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,940
um a uh project is begun on the 802 side

234
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,279
we ask the question is this a thing

235
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,100
where there's coordination needed

236
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,339
the further from the layer to layer

237
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,740
three boundary you are the less likely

238
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,779
there'll be coordination so if you're

239
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,459
down at the physical layer we're

240
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,260
probably not going to be talking about

241
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,959
this if you're at the application layer

242
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,459
it's probably not going to be on the

243
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,620
coordination list but the closer you get

244
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,600
to where the groups rub against each

245
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,899
other that's where where we talk

246
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:22,740
um

247
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,540
it's also

248
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,880
um when new projects get started they're

249
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,279
shared on the new work mail list

250
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,580
and we basically solicit reviews on

251
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,800
these calls as well

252
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,040
um okay this Topic's coming up make sure

253
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,140
that you take a look at that Charter

254
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,660
this documents become

255
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,899
um stable and we think you have an

256
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,620
interest in it please review

257
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,779
and historically much of the

258
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,540
collaboration has actually fallen on

259
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,519
individuals who participate in both

260
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,420
groups I don't think that's unnatural

261
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,760
um and I think it's actually very

262
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,980
valuable and right now we have a couple

263
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,860
groups that straddle that line like the

264
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,100
detnet group has some dependencies on

265
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,279
the time-sensitive networking work that

266
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,300
is going on in 802 and there are people

267
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,459
who are participating in both groups and

268
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,040
making sure that the information about

269
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,320
what one is doing is Flowing to the

270
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,579
other next slide please

271
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,320
so uh the liaison managers we have

272
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,540
several

273
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,660
I provide the liaison management from

274
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,480
the iitf to the IEEE standards

275
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,579
Association

276
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,000
uh Dorothy Stanley is uh who's actually

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,540
the chair of 802.11 was named as the

278
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,839
liaison uh from the full project 802

279
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,160
back to the ITF and Peter Yee um for the

280
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,980
just the Wi-Fi part

281
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,180
the guidance regarding these uh when to

282
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,640
do formal Liaisons as opposed to just

283
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,519
informal coordination

284
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,959
um from the ITF is is in BCP 103 and

285
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,500
there's a similar uh policy level

286
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,540
document in 802 at that URL

287
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,440
um

288
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
and there's two URLs if you want to

289
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,360
learn more about the way that the

290
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,940
collaboration is done and the minutes

291
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,480
from those collaboration calls and so on

292
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,079
next slide

293
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,320
so

294
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,700
um

295
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,220
protocol parameter out parameter

296
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,860
allocation goes on differently in the

297
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,660
two groups

298
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,500
Ayanna has to do with uh the way that we

299
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,779
would allocate a parameter and the um

300
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:59,519
IEEE side they have the IEEE

301
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,399
registration Authority which has a

302
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,139
committee that oversees it called the

303
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:04,920
rack

304
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,959
and I always think of that and think

305
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,800
about here in London the rack but anyway

306
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,420
um the

307
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,100
um

308
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,959
they have an oversight group that does

309
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,500
the the technical side and

310
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,120
um we

311
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,980
um

312
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,639
have various Iana parameter allocation

313
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,760
policies whenever it's a scarce resource

314
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,639
of course we require standards action

315
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,260
when it's a bigger code space we have

316
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,740
less stringent rules and there are some

317
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,420
rules about there is an oui the top 24

318
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,500
bits of a MAC address assigned and Diana

319
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,260
has special rules for if you need one of

320
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,380
those how to get one

321
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,240
um there are a few Registries that are

322
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,519
are joint use

323
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,839
um

324
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,959
basically when a document it's

325
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,779
progressing through one of the two

326
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,459
bodies or the other needs a code point

327
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,860
from the other uh that's where we

328
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,959
coordinate to make sure an assignment

329
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,220
happens that makes sense next slide

330
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,399
so in summary the the two groups have a

331
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,459
great working relationship

332
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,899
informal Communications between the

333
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,420
leaders uh is really important because

334
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,700
then they know each other so whenever

335
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,839
some friction occurs basically they know

336
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,279
each other they can talk to each other

337
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,220
it helps a lot as opposed to the cold

338
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,600
call

339
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,540
um and these coordination sessions that

340
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,820
happen three times a year really do help

341
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,880
identify potential areas of uh

342
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,699
collaboration or friction the point is

343
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,279
to identify the both as early as

344
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,720
possible and when we do identify a place

345
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,779
where there is friction we have held

346
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,399
face-to-face meetings

347
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,040
um either a breakfast session at an ITF

348
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,440
or a session at the

349
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,160
um an 802 meeting and occasionally we

350
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,019
have meetings in the same place in

351
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,860
back-to-back weeks and when that happens

352
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,420
we make sure the leadership gets to

353
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,120
spend a little bit of time together so

354
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,839
again that they know each other

355
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,440
Juan Carlos go ahead yes hi Russ sorry I

356
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,800
was trying to get on the cue but yeah

357
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,940
you should go but now you're talking

358
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,339
already my eight or two at 11 connection

359
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,060
was fake

360
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,000
uh just just want to make uh a comment

361
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,680
about an example of one of those

362
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,540
coordinations because we've been talking

363
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,820
through this week with the rack with

364
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,339
Roger and Glenn about a specific point

365
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,920
of coordination regarding the the IEEE

366
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,440
802 numbering okay and we will have some

367
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,500
discussions uh at the interior this week

368
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,420
so for people that are interested and

369
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,639
seeing a real life example of one of

370
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,980
these coordinations we will Lively

371
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,440
discuss uh exactly how to best

372
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,660
coordinate this Ayanna registry with the

373
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,579
highee 802 registry and some

374
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,980
incoherences that we are finding out and

375
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,480
some opportunities to make it work

376
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,899
better okay so if anyone is interested

377
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,120
in meter types another topic where

378
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,160
there's been a lot of collaboration of

379
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,740
late is on Yang modules correct making

380
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,980
sure that uh when 802 develops one the

381
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,820
the Yang doctors review it and so on so

382
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,699
it's I'm glad it's working Barry hearing

383
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:36,660
Cube

384
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,139
foreign

385
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,420
just to give people an idea of how how

386
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,279
mature this is and how long it's been

387
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,920
going on how long have the coordination

388
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,120
meetings been happening

389
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,079
uh there's been 30 some of them that's

390
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,959
all I can remember so at roughly uh

391
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,459
quite quite some years yeah exactly

392
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,959
I did close the queue because we don't

393
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,720
have a lot of time but we take we take

394
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,119
you food okay yeah yeah uh well

395
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,740
coordination's good

396
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,339
but

397
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,419
I remember

398
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,099
the first uh Wi-Fi security holes

399
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,319
being identified

400
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,980
and then it was like five years before

401
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,960
those were fixed

402
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,980
and then another 15 years before they

403
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,400
were really fixed

404
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,520
and I'm still trying to connect up to my

405
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,780
manage my Wi-Fi devices in the house

406
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,419
and I'm still not seeing Solutions out

407
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,480
of Wi-Fi world

408
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,020
and I think that we should not be too

409
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,299
deferential

410
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:01,440
if a group is not delivering for the end

411
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,799
users of the internet

412
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,100
and not providing a specification that

413
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,860
is actually usable

414
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,600
then at some point we've got to say

415
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,179
we're just going to do it ourselves

416
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,700
and if we don't say it here somebody

417
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,080
else will

418
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,600
so there are some examples where we have

419
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,860
done that

420
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,960
um after coordination

421
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,960
um like uh Warren had the captive portal

422
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,559
uh Group which was uh

423
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,140
intended to solve a small piece of that

424
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,100
problem

425
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,580
and and certainly I think we have other

426
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,100
examples but uh

427
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,820
I would discourage just grabbing a space

428
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,640
without talking so that you know you're

429
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,320
grabbing a particular piece of the

430
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,440
problem uh when we surprise each other

431
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,179
is when things get most ugly

432
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:58,980
yeah thank you that's a very good last

433
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,660
sentence if you have more questions

434
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,880
about IEEE talk to Russ or if you have

435
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,380
questions about liaison talk to us the

436
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,299
IB

437
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,160
um and we're rushing towards giving us a

438
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,080
report about one of our latest workshops

439
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,059
yep so we just held a workshop this will

440
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,679
be really short uh because you should go

441
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,179
watch the Youtube videos rather than

442
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,520
listen to me try and summarize it but we

443
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,679
had a workshop on managing encrypted

444
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,299
networks uh I think it went off

445
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,860
fantastically it was sort of three days

446
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,080
long the purpose of the workshop you

447
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,400
know is there on the slide that's sort

448
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,960
of the most important sentence that says

449
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,480
this Workshop was to discuss how do we

450
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,460
improve Network management as encryption

451
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,200
kind of keeps ramping and ramping up on

452
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,880
the Internet which is both good for end

453
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,100
users but it does make some things like

454
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,780
traffic prioritization and other

455
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,000
management techniques difficult

456
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,580
so we divided the workshop into three

457
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,020
different two-hour sessions they were

458
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,400
two hours each day from a Monday to

459
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,620
Wednesday the first one was you know

460
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,900
where do we go where are we now how does

461
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,160
the world exist

462
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,780
um what are the requirements and passive

463
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,059
observations uh the second one is where

464
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,679
do we want to go right what do we want

465
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,960
where do we want to get to uh what are

466
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,460
the collaboration principles and then

467
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,559
the final uh day was on how do we get

468
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,760
there what are what are like the future

469
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,440
thinking how do we how do we actually

470
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,919
make progress next

471
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,620
so the result was uh an excellent three

472
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,600
days as I said there was roughly 35

473
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,760
participants every day roughly I think

474
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,440
it was a little bit less on each day but

475
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,140
it rolled a little bit and the topics

476
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,880
and presentations included you know a

477
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,380
lot of things I listed sort of four

478
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,600
bullets out of a bunch of stuff there

479
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,120
was um a number of talks that were given

480
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,160
and a lot of discussion and they're all

481
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,660
available on YouTube as I said that'll

482
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,240
be on the next slide um but how do we

483
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,940
you know manage encrypted traffic

484
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,660
um

485
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,640
sorry

486
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,500
um you know how do we do this in a data

487
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,640
center kind of world there was actually

488
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,200
a good talk about how it actually is

489
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,600
being done in a data center World

490
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,220
um what are the benefits and motivation

491
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,900
for collaboration and I think to me

492
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,640
that's one of the biggest takeaways how

493
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,620
can we get end users to actually tell

494
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,299
their isps what they need when they're

495
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,160
encrypting their traffic in a way that's

496
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,919
safe for them so that's actually

497
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,000
um so there's there's a bunch of good

498
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,440
proposals for doing that all right now

499
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,799
you can go on

500
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,200
uh so this is sort of the final list I

501
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,880
should say the one thing that I forgot

502
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,860
to put on these list is uh thank you to

503
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,360
the program committee so I will do that

504
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,460
now the program committee you know

505
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,840
consisted of mattering notable and

506
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,179
amiria kudwin uh Tommy Pauley restaurant

507
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,460
and and Chi Wu

508
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,380
um so thank you to all of those members

509
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,940
and then the YouTube recordings are

510
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,620
there they're only two hours each um so

511
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,880
you can put them on fast forward if you

512
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,500
want and uh you'll learn a lot from them

513
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,539
so I suggest you look at them

514
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,220
thanks Luis thanks to all the

515
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,840
participants for that Workshop

516
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,179
and thanks in advance for those people

517
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,980
who will be writing the report so

518
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,960
hopefully that's coming up soon

519
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,320
okay next presentation we have told me I

520
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,439
believe

521
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,159
yeah and somehow this is not working

522
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,140
all right hello uh yeah if you could

523
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,780
approve the slide sharing

524
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,360
yeah

525
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,539
thank you

526
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,960
Tommy I can't answer can you try to

527
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,600
share to request sharing

528
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,620
I I am requesting it I am requesting

529
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,720
I think you just need to hit

530
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
oh it says you're offline now

531
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,020
that's great

532
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,880
was the secret

533
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
perfect

534
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,860
all right

535
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,000
hey everyone

536
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,780
um

537
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,880
I'll just give a five minute rundown on

538
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,220
a new document we have published we

539
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,780
haven't discussed it much on list yet

540
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,419
but this is a early preview of it

541
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,480
and it's talking about partitioning as

542
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,059
an emerging architecture we see uh in

543
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,980
the space of uh protocols that are

544
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,380
trying to enhance privacy

545
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,820
and so I've been working on this with

546
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,460
miria as well as Chris Wood who has been

547
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,559
contributing as a non-iab member

548
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,940
so overall

549
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,820
we observe that many generally newer

550
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,120
groups within ietf are trying to improve

551
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,880
user privacy based on separating data

552
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,000
out between different entities

553
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,200
uh this is kind of core to what Ojai is

554
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,919
doing for oblivious HTTP it's uh one of

555
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,740
the reasons that motivates mask which is

556
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,340
doing uh HTTP based proxies that can

557
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,760
proxy UDP and IP traffic

558
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,280
it's very fundamental to PPM which is a

559
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,659
meeting going on right now about

560
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,400
collecting metrics and splitting them up

561
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,780
between different entities before

562
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,460
rejoining data

563
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,140
and it's also fundamental to privacy

564
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,220
pass

565
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,179
which is all about being able to

566
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,780
uh authenticate or prove some property

567
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,200
about a client using uh information and

568
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,720
attestation from a different path or a

569
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,260
different entity

570
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,940
so these have many different use cases

571
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,820
but they all benefit in a privacy aspect

572
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,520
from partitioning so this can be about

573
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,799
separating out client IP addresses from

574
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,559
the user data it can be separating user

575
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,200
authorization from actual content access

576
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,480
like in privacy pass

577
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,460
or it can be separating the client

578
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,200
identities from metrics

579
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:28,140
so partitioning for privacy is an

580
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,640
emerging architecture pattern that we

581
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,380
see so we think it's something that we

582
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,080
should comment on and help explain

583
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,299
because you know collectively as an ITF

584
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,460
Community we need to work on ways to

585
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,380
discuss analyze and evaluate these

586
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,900
protocols and what they have in common

587
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,039
because we don't think this is a pattern

588
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,780
that's going to go away but it's

589
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,220
something that we don't have a lot of

590
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,799
language for already

591
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,380
so you can read the document as a high

592
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,360
level it's uh talking about privacy

593
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,700
contexts as the things that are

594
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,860
partitioned where a context is a group

595
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,720
of entities that share

596
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,919
us a common view of data and metadata

597
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,320
and So within a context the data and

598
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,320
identifiers are all correlatable and all

599
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,400
shared

600
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,140
and so in order to partition data you

601
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,900
need to split contexts and that happens

602
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,360
either through encryption or through

603
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,679
literally just having separate

604
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,200
connections over space or time

605
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,360
and those two building blocks are what

606
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,520
go into making all of those different

607
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,720
protocols that we mentioned before

608
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,659
so for example in oblivious HTTP

609
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:34,799
you end up with various different

610
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,640
contexts of uh who can see what based on

611
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,500
different encryption boundaries

612
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,179
this is just one of the examples we go

613
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,580
through in the document

614
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,020
and so out of this we think there are a

615
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,940
lot of interesting observations we can

616
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,279
make that

617
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:53,400
um you know first partitioning is just a

618
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,960
tool it's a building block that we see

619
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,940
it's not a Panacea it doesn't mean that

620
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,059
you're private by default there's a lot

621
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,340
of Reliance on non-collusion and you

622
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,779
have to make sure that you're selecting

623
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,120
the boundaries of what is in your

624
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,100
context and who is in your context very

625
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,799
carefully to have a good effect

626
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,360
um we talk a bit about the impacts on

627
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,480
manageability of data

628
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,860
we mentioned that it's important to

629
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,020
think about performance and also the

630
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,820
fact that

631
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,840
um

632
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,340
there are still attacks that you can do

633
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,620
by looking at traffic analysis and other

634
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,299
patterns to understand what data is

635
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:28,860
going on so this is only part of the

636
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,158
puzzle

637
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,480
so in conclusion

638
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,760
read the document provide input this is

639
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,179
early but uh we think it's going to be a

640
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,940
important contribution to future work in

641
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,520
the ITF thank you

642
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,500
foreign and if there are any questions

643
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,380
right now happy to hear them

644
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,179
yeah thanks

645
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:52,679
to our way to set

646
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,580
you said anybody wants to jump in

647
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,960
one

648
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,059
can I

649
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,820
okay exchange I think you know what I'm

650
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,039
going to say but yeah I think that well

651
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,320
this is an important discussion but then

652
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,179
I mean depending on how this is deployed

653
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,740
and designed on the economic incentives

654
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,919
on the policies and so on Technical and

655
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,900
not technical parts of it this might

656
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,000
actually provoke more centralization and

657
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,400
less privacy than actually distribute

658
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,840
and create more privacy so it depends

659
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,760
whether you build this architecture in a

660
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,220
way so that you have one Million Parts

661
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,200
through which you can choose I mean but

662
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,700
if you're just creating something which

663
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,919
is so hard to deploy that only three

664
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,299
companies in the plant will actually

665
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,760
provided this intermediate service or

666
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,320
whatever then the result will be

667
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,020
centralization and less privacy so I'm I

668
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,400
think we'll have the discussion but I

669
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,140
just wanted to flag the issue that it

670
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,179
really depends on how you design and how

671
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:52,740
you deployed it in terms of incentives

672
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,240
not just technical ones but also

673
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,000
economic and policy ones yeah thank you

674
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,820
and I think that's exactly the type of

675
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,100
uh commentary and discussion that

676
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,659
belongs in this document so it can say

677
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,000
Hey you know just because your

678
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,980
partitioning data doesn't mean that it's

679
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,659
always the right thing to do or you need

680
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,919
to be careful in how you do it

681
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,500
okay perfect this document was just the

682
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,200
zero zero version posted um and if you

683
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,760
want to provide more comments uh you

684
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,740
will see a call for feedback

685
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,960
or a call yeah that's kind of how we

686
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,340
call it differently it doesn't matter

687
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,140
you can comment on the architect to

688
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,799
discuss list okay let's move on

689
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,659
hey everyone so I'm going to take over

690
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:36,000
with our last with that last half of our

691
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,159
program today so it's really excellent

692
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,320
we are about five minutes ahead um

693
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,360
because I think the next two invited

694
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,100
talks we're gonna Sparkle out of

695

so can you can you request sharing and

704
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,900

705
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,700
control them yourself I requested uh I

706
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,400

so

711
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:34,919
I don't see any change in the UI though

712
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,919
uh

713
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:41,580

720
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,539
let's start thanks for inviting me here

721
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,960
uh I'm Simone I work at Uni uh here what

722
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,960
I'm going to provide you is a bird view

723
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,159
of this report that we wrote about a

724
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,500
surgeon censorship in Iran

725
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,620
um during the first weeks of the Maza

726
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,779
amini protests

727
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:26,039
um so uh let's see okay I can also

728
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,380
progress slides fantastic okay I will

729
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,740
first to tell you what we are so your

730
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,539
free software product who needs a free

731
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:37,260
software project we started in 2012 and

732
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,840
um what we do basically is to provide

733
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,940
people with tools that they can install

734
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,360
on their phones or or on their desktops

735
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,480
or command line tools with which it can

736
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,779
run tasks from the address from their

737
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,659
own tools from their own computers uh to

738
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,380
measure censorship and then those data

739
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,840
is submitted to us and we publish it and

740
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,200
since 2012 we um covered more than 200

741
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,179
countries and published more than a

742
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:10,140
billion measurements and yeah the the

743
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,059
way in which many users interacts with

744
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:15,419
the tool is that it's a mobile app or a

745
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,880
desktop where you can choose categories

746
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,240
of tasks to run so for example in this

747
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,559
presentation I'm going to show you

748
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,899
results from the websites

749
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,659
um kind of tasks where there is a set

750
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:31,799
fuels that we choose and that we um

751
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:35,039
basically we track four when the task is

752
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,659
running but we also passed instant

753
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:39,179
messaging apps by tracking services that

754
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,799
are relevant to them so those are the

755
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,559
two most important uh group of tasks

756
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:46,919
that we we are going to discuss

757
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,159
um then like what happens is that users

758
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,640
runs the uniprobe tool and then submit

759
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,919
measurements to our backend which is the

760
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,380
gray thing in there and then eventually

761
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,240
we have an API to access the

762
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,940
measurements and

763
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,679
the uh there is a website called Lumi

764
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:07,080
Explorer which allows to see individual

765
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,360
measurements or to group measurements

766
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,419
together produce charts Etc and that

767
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,640
creates value for researchers including

768
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,919
us and users that want to explore all of

769
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,679
that in particular we have this tool

770
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,659
called math measurement aggregation

771
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,919
toolkit which is allows anyone to

772
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,380
produce charts and those charts

773
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,659
basically are the charts that I'm going

774
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,640
to use that we used in the original

775
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
reports so uh that's the tool and and

776
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,760
yeah you can uh basically reproduce the

777
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,559
charts that I'm going to show for

778
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,640
yourself uh using this tool so now that

779
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,620
I have set the stage let's uh so let's

780
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,899
enter into the report itself

781
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,360
slash reports on our website is the

782
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,159
directory where we publish all our

783
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,740
reports the specific one that I'm going

784
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,220
to tell you the high level results of is

785
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,919
this uh one on uh like on Iran after the

786
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,600
um a few weeks after the beginning of

787
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,940
the protest we actually finished it on

788
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,720
the 25th of September and

789
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,220
um so let's uh uh before before I I show

790
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,039
you some of our results let's say that

791
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,399
uh as you probably already know uh there

792
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,679
was lots of censorship in Iran before

793
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,179
and there were a few a few services that

794
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,360
were available and the I like the tldr

795
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,299
of this report is that the situation

796
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:39,919
um

797
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,559
became worst uh quite worst but but

798
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,360
still it's important to remember the

799
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,240
starting point was not good at all

800
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,799
um so let's for example uh start to to

801
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,019
see one of the charts that we included

802
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:57,720
into the report this is about DNS over

803
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,179
https and

804
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,240
there are rows in this chart each row is

805
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,380
a service that you can use to Doh and

806
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,119
then uh each bar is a uh the the height

807
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,320
of each bar is the number of

808
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,960
measurements we collected in a single

809
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,719
day in Iran and then there are those

810
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,020
colors it's a stat plot so basically the

811
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,359
um the amount of a color that you see is

812
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:26,839
the percentage of that color on that day

813
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:30,119
uh okay green is obvious so nothing to

814
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,940
say here then we have these two

815
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,760
um colors that are red and yellow and

816
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,940
red is confirmed what this means is that

817
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,940
there are signatures with and other

818
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,918
people doing research on this field as

819
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,739
collected over time that you can find

820
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,980
for example in HTTP bodies or in the DNS

821
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,699
replies that are

822
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:57,060
a clear indication of censorship and

823
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,500
when we see those signatures uh the

824
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,140
measurement is flagged as confirmed now

825
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:08,400
in the case of Iran where all like Iran

826
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,280
is many many are private IP addresses

827
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,500
inside the country and there are a few

828
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,320
of them a few of these bobans that are

829
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,300
well known to be associated with

830
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,740
censoring

831
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,680
um so when when we in this specific case

832
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,900
when we found those backgrounds we said

833
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,160
rad okay this measurement really uh

834
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,920
direct attempt of sensory uh then yellow

835
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,820
is mostly unexpected network errors so

836
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,900
uh cases that you uh will see in Iran

837
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,200
are most often uh you perform at the

838
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,180
last hand track but you plan out during

839
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,940
the entry and there is some filtering

840
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,660
that depends on the client to know uh or

841
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,020
the endpoints that that will use what

842
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,960
cause the handshake to time out or in

843
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,820
other case that is frequent in Iran is

844
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,339
that utcp or not but your time out

845
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:04,440
because the connect never terminate so

846
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,960
those are the yellow cases that we see

847
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,060
here

848
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,280
um like without going too much in that

849
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,619
but just to say that

850
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,720
um we know by inspecting them as Romans

851
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,140
that what we had was a superimposition

852
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,200
of uh anomalies and confirmed so for

853
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,960
example uh you see that there that there

854
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,640
are these three services that were

855
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,619
already filling with anomalies and those

856
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,800
anomalies were mostly telecentrics now

857
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,859
um

858
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,160
on the 21st and this is basically the

859
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,320
pattern so uh we can see the same

860
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,500
pattern across other kind of services so

861
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,500
WhatsApp was working before and this is

862
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,440
notable because a signal for example was

863
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,320
tampered with in Iran before and also

864
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,480
telegram was and WhatsApp installed was

865
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,280
working and there we have a bunch of

866
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,780
services that are relevant to WhatsApp

867
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,200
and they on the 21st again turned yellow

868
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,960
starting and anomalies

869
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,359
um the same happened for Instagram which

870
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,160
was one of the few social networks that

871
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,079
was still working in the country and

872
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,560
again on the 21st uh those many services

873
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,619
that are useful uh to Instagram they

874
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,060
became basically uh anomalies so mostly

875
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,339
tls-centric timing out

876
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:27,599
um so about stores uh the stores like

877
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,880
for book apple and

878
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,460
Google's Play Store what happened is

879
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,640
that I it started not working a few days

880
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,220
later and what what happened is that

881
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,940
they the censorship was mainly targeting

882
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,680
the services that are useful to install

883
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,260
applications but the rest was working so

884
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,200
for example your foreign for the App

885
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,960
Store after a certain hour of the 20

886
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,440
second all tasks start failing and

887
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,920
providing these confirmed results and

888
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,720
the same happened for the Play Store

889
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,180
where play.google app is.com seems to be

890
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,099
very important for installing new

891
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,140
applications and yeah the rest was

892
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,900
mostly working but yeah this prevented

893
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,480
people from installing applications and

894
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,079
finally LinkedIn similar story but

895
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,020
shifted a little bit in time after a

896
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,760
certain moment in time it starts not

897
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,839
working so to summarize on top of an

898
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:28,859
already a big uh like uh censorship

899
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:32,579
condition uh people from Iran started

900
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:35,400
not being able to use DNS server https

901
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,800
which reduced their opportunities to

902
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,420
that good IP addresses and then the

903
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,760
instant messaging tool that was working

904
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,040
started having issues and then social

905
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,220
networks such as uh LinkedIn and

906
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,040
Instagram were not working anymore and

907
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,980
stores from which you can install tools

908
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,940
like siphon or Lantern or Thor to

909
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,400
circumvent circumvention they were not

910
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,220
working anymore so basically yeah this

911
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,560
is what we observed at the beginning of

912
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,079
the process thank you

913
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,359
thanks a lot simana

914
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:15,119
um so we're going to wait until the end

915
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,460
of our invited talks are finished for

916
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,619
questions and so we'll go ahead and

917
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,359
invite Masa up

918
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,440
so Masa works at the um

919
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,720
Article 19 which is

920
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,119
um I just for disclosure purposes I used

921
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,280
to work there as well um she's also a

922
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,740
senior researcher in the Mina region at

923
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,920
um at the University of Oxford as a PhD

924
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,020
candidate so we're really excited to

925
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,859
have her come up to talk more about what

926
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:47,220
activists are seeing on the ground as

927
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,900
um you know folks are actually dealing

928
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,900
with these shutdowns and we also have

929
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,180
her slide so we're going to give you

930
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,220
we've given you a little bit of a more

931
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,260
technical view of what the shutdowns are

932
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,880
looking like and this is just more of

933
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,220
the the real human side of things as

934
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,640
well um and so I'll yeah let Masa go

935
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,440
ahead

936
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,099
foreign

937
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,400
yeah sure

938
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,900
um hi everyone uh

939
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,119
okay yeah like

940
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,180
um Mallory said I work at Article 19 I'm

941
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,700
a senior researcher focusing on the Mina

942
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,720
region

943
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,380
and um for the past seven weeks

944
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,079
um I guess uh our teams working on Iran

945
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,680
have been full on working on this issue

946
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,240
um some people call this a revolution

947
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,680
because

948
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,380
um things have changed drastically and

949
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,119
you know it's a bit unprecedented to see

950
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,820
a protest movement like this uh continue

951
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,579
on for such a long period of time and

952
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,160
Technology obviously plays a really big

953
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,839
role

954
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,359
um so the last time we saw something on

955
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,820
this scale was back during November of

956
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,859
2019 in Iran

957
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,660
um of course uh protests have been

958
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,920
continuous

959
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,660
um they I mean even before this round

960
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,880
there were protests in different

961
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,940
provinces over different issues like

962
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,640
um you know water crises food crises and

963
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,619
things like that

964
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:17,760
um and

965
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,560
every time there are internet

966
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,140
disruptions and there is some sort of

967
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,540
restrictions on access

968
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,280
um online

969
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,420
um so the largest scale of shutdowns we

970
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,940
saw was during November 2019 and so for

971
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,060
a period of over a week

972
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,220
the entire country kind of

973
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,940
um

974
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,980
essentially went offline from the

975
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,380
international internet there was access

976
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,820
to

977
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,880
um you know National internet services

978
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,320
um and so you know some of you might

979
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,540
have heard of November 2019 in terms of

980
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,460
what they did

981
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,400
um clearly the digital repression was

982
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,579
accompanied by you know offline severe

983
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:00,780
brutality

984
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,920
um uh the difficulty in documenting um

985
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,140
how many people were killed in the

986
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,060
darkness of the shutdowns

987
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,780
um has been uh obviously has meant that

988
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,060
we don't know the exact figures Amnesty

989
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,200
International has verified something

990
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,839
around 300 people who have died but

991
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:21,119
estimates say they're actually closer to

992
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,400
1500 people were killed by authorities

993
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,339
while protesting

994
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:27,540
um and you know there's been a lot of

995
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,940
research by Article 19 and Amnesty

996
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,440
International to show that you know

997
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,560
these crimes against life uh were

998
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,540
largely facilitated by internet shutdown

999
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,740
so

1000
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,320
um these technical discussions uh have

1001
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,500
very real uh impact on you know just the

1002
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,060
right to life and the right to protest

1003
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,960
in Iran so um at Article 19 we did

1004
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,760
really in-depth research to kind of look

1005
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,380
at the anatomy of what happened during

1006
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,060
2019.

1007
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,800
um even though there was a kind of

1008
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,140
international shutdown uh there wasn't

1009
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,180
kind of an off switch

1010
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,760
um and so there's a map behind me of

1011
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,520
what the internet looked like in 2019 in

1012
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,480
terms of how isps uh were organized

1013
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,359
um so basically what we see is there

1014
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,460
wasn't necessarily A centralization in

1015
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,040
how the internet was shut off but there

1016
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,500
has been a centralization in terms of

1017
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,380
how isps are organized and so most

1018
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,599
civilian connections if you can see up

1019
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,180
there in the blue originate from the

1020
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,740
Telecommunications infrastructure

1021
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,680
company of Iran and so there is you know

1022
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,540
a communication regulatory Authority

1023
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,040
that tells

1024
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,200
the various isps what kind of

1025
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,839
restrictions they have to place

1026
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,540
um on their users and so

1027
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,460
um you know the level of shutdowns

1028
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,099
occurred really at the ISP levels

1029
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,440
um uh in that way

1030
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,119
um and so you know our research did

1031
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,680
indicate that despite you know the

1032
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,420
centralization and governance there

1033
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,040
hasn't necessarily been a centralization

1034
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,520
an infrastructure after 2019 there were

1035
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,200
continued growth in you know internet

1036
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,900
exchange points facilitating more

1037
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,859
connections to the international

1038
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,500
internet so despite the fact that you

1039
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,880
know there has been a lot of talk about

1040
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,220
how Iran is trying to nationalize its

1041
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,980
internet or move towards a kind of North

1042
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,060
Korean national internet infrastructure

1043
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,099
um it is still you know investing in

1044
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:21,599
international connections so that's

1045
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,540
interesting so this brings me to what's

1046
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,780
happening now next slide

1047
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,520
um so there were a lot of lessons

1048
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,980
learned from 2019

1049
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,560
um in terms of what these shutdowns did

1050
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,260
for the Iranian economy clearly there

1051
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,359
were billions of dollars lost to the

1052
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,000
Iranian economy in 2019 when there was a

1053
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,460
week week-long shut down from the

1054
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,800
international internet and so

1055
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,839
um like every kind of protest crisis

1056
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,140
that has occurred in this uh country

1057
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,480
um there has been a period of very deep

1058
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,460
thought and development by authorities

1059
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,940
in terms of Lessons Learned and 2019 was

1060
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,760
one of these periods and so one of the

1061
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,220
reflections was how to make

1062
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,740
uh digital repression essentially more

1063
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,319
efficient and less costly for the

1064
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,880
government and one of the means that

1065
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,000
really was developed was the policies

1066
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,099
and Technical

1067
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:19,380
um underpinnings of this particular bill

1068
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,480
that's called the user protection bill

1069
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,300
or in Persian it's called parisianet

1070
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,660
and of course the user protection bill

1071
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,700
is not necessarily to protect Iranian

1072
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,040
users it's more to protect Iranian

1073
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,500
authorities and really leave Iranian

1074
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,420
users vulnerable

1075
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,280
um and so there are a number of

1076
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,099
different you know Draconian articles

1077
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:43,560
within this bill this bill is so

1078
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,720
unpopular that even really conservative

1079
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,359
Hardline elements in Iran like Iran's

1080
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:52,200
you know student besiege forces have

1081
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,780
um you know protested this bill and you

1082
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,339
know student besiege are some of the

1083
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:57,920
most Hardline

1084
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,839
authoritarian groups in Iran um and so

1085
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:02,940
there's deep unpopularity about the bill

1086
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,800
because it's going to severely hurt the

1087
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,920
economy however this hasn't stopped the

1088
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,260
fact that there has been a silent

1089
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,060
implementation of a lot of the policies

1090
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,780
in the bill and one of the I mean

1091
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,339
there's a lot of different elements from

1092
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:18,839
the fact that they want to centralize

1093
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:20,880
internet exchange points into the hands

1094
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,640
of the Armed Forces but one of the

1095
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,140
points in the bill that has been

1096
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,940
particularly significant and you know

1097
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,619
our colleagues at Uni also pointed out

1098
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,260
to is this element where they want to

1099
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,780
criminalize the sale of vpns and

1100
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,480
essentially disable technically disable

1101
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,660
the use of vpns and they want to build a

1102
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,380
kind of model of legal vpns where the

1103
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,960
government facilitates different kind

1104
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,880
different tiers of access to different

1105
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,339
individuals in Iran based on their

1106
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:52,140
profession based on their Identity or

1107
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,900
connections to have these legal vpns

1108
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,520
that essentially gives you know white

1109
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,220
lists for internet access as opposed to

1110
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,339
You Know The Blacklist that currently

1111
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:04,560
exists and so how does the government go

1112
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,660
about technically disabling access to

1113
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,640
vpns and so

1114
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,619
um at Article 19 we had been trying to

1115
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,380
understand how this is happening and so

1116
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,020
um as far back as October 2021 we

1117
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,060
started seeing evidence of you know a

1118
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,300
very sophisticated development of um

1119
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,800
this kind of technology so during

1120
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,380
October 2021 there wasn't necessarily

1121
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,000
any protests in Iran there wasn't

1122
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,819
necessarily any events but there was

1123
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:32,819
severe disruptions occurring on the

1124
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:34,800
Iranian Network and so when we did a

1125
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,540
deep dive into it and talked to network

1126
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,660
Engineers inside Iran it seemed like

1127
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,640
there was

1128
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,160
you know a specific focus on tampering

1129
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,040
and disconnecting VPN protocols and so

1130
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,780
there's actually

1131
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,819
um you know a testimony from a network

1132
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:52,740
engineer we spoke to

1133
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,800
where he was saying that basically the

1134
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,599
health of the network was severely

1135
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,700
deteriorating at that point as they were

1136
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,740
testing these different

1137
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,480
um forms of what seemed like the packet

1138
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,460
inspection against the circumvention

1139
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,200
methods

1140
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,819
so

1141
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,740
um it did seem like they were really

1142
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,260
working on this effort if you go to the

1143
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,020
next slide and of course this now brings

1144
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,140
us to right now so since September 16

1145
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:23,220
when Masa or Gina amini died after being

1146
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,920
in custody with the morality police we

1147
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,500
immediately saw protests they started at

1148
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,540
her Hospital in Tehran on the 16th and

1149
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,060
they spread to be National protests by

1150
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,339
the 17th they've basically continued

1151
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:37,560
until right this very minute

1152
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,040
and so this is pretty historic and

1153
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,960
unprecedented in terms of the length of

1154
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,359
protests and the various different

1155
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,140
techniques we have seen are very new and

1156
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,060
I think talk to the fact that

1157
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,160
authorities had been planning for a

1158
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,839
moment like this and planning on these

1159
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:57,300
different methods to try to reduce the

1160
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,319
kind of costs to the economy to how the

1161
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,020
nation functions and so there's been

1162
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,359
really four techniques we've been

1163
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:09,240
noticing mobile curfews Iran like a lot

1164
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,700
of countries internet access is mostly

1165
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,300
facilitated through mobile internet data

1166
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,400
and so it's very significant and

1167
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,579
protests typically surge around 4 P.M

1168
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:24,480
between 4 P.M and 1am and so the major

1169
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,540
um if you go to the next slide some of

1170
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,420
the major mobile carriers in Iran up

1171
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,839
here we have Iran cell reitel and Hamra

1172
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,579
Ava these are the most used mobile

1173
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:38,819
carriers in Iran and you can see by

1174
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:40,619
um this period of time during these

1175
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:43,680
protests we have clear moments where um

1176
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,540
you know there's mobile curfews and you

1177
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,060
know after the mobile curfews and we can

1178
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,859
see a surge in Mobile use

1179
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:55,440
um next slide

1180
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,900
and so another uh thing we've been

1181
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,460
seeing although we haven't been seeing

1182
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,220
National shutdowns we've been seeing you

1183
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,960
know select days where internet is shut

1184
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,839
down in specific regions where there's

1185
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:09,839
the highest protest brutality this is a

1186
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,480
snippet from one day uh from October 8th

1187
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,640
to the 9th in the province of Kurdistan

1188
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,400
Masa amini was from Kurdistan so there's

1189
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,200
been a lot of days like this where the

1190
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,960
internet is shut and you know others

1191
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,940
other provinces where historically

1192
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,240
marginalized groups like The baluchis

1193
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,520
and the Kurds are have been seeing a lot

1194
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,740
of days like this

1195
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,160
um and accompanied usually by massacres

1196
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,020
um so like I mentioned I think the

1197
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,200
biggest and most concerning aspect we're

1198
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,359
seeing is how they are attacking

1199
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:44,220
circumvention technology at the moment

1200
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,200
and of course this is really important

1201
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,059
because

1202
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,040
um you know within the first few days of

1203
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,800
the protests most remaining and most

1204
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,000
popular

1205
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,380
um foreign

1206
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,960
internet services were blocked so

1207
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,240
Instagram was the most used social media

1208
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,220
in Iran it was blocked within a few days

1209
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,140
of the protests

1210
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,760
um WhatsApp was blocked within the first

1211
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,619
few days of the protest and slowly most

1212
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:10,440
as our colleagues at Uni said most

1213
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,500
foreign services or really any kind of

1214
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,140
Foreign Service were communication or

1215
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,180
coordination could occur has been

1216
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,680
blocked

1217
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,380
um and so this also is part of the

1218
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,720
overall plans that were in place for the

1219
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,980
bill

1220
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,780
um and not only did they do this but

1221
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,640
they blocked the App Store so when they

1222
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,740
blocked app stores like Google Play

1223
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:34,559
Store and Apple App Store this means

1224
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,800
that when you know the existing vpns are

1225
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,319
disabled it's very hard there's a new

1226
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,079
hurdle in getting new functional and

1227
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:46,440
secure vpns Iran is well known for

1228
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,140
having you know National vpns that are

1229
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,000
well known to be operated by authorities

1230
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,359
who monitor or you know pick up data

1231
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,720
from the vpns that they make themselves

1232
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,200
so secure vpns is a major issue and we

1233
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,540
have noted that there's a large majority

1234
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,339
of Iranians are using kind of national

1235
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:09,960
vpns where the security is very shady

1236
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,260
um and so uh like I mentioned and like

1237
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,540
um our uni colleagues also alluded to

1238
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,119
there has been different kind of

1239
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:20,040
um evidences of what they're doing to

1240
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,160
make circumvention really difficult

1241
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,599
um so you know we're guessing there's

1242
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,000
very sophisticated the packet inspection

1243
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,099
we've also seen increased blocking of

1244
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:32,160
encrypted DNS and you know complete

1245
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,520
blocking of HTTP 3 and quick traffic

1246
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,980
um I'm not a particularly you know um

1247
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,260
technical person into the fine-graining

1248
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,720
of this but I'm sure a lot of people in

1249
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,059
this room are aware of this so

1250
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:46,200
um these are some of the things that

1251
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,240
we've been seeing

1252
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,000
um next slide so this essentially brings

1253
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,760
us to what can be done

1254
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,520
um I mean you might have been following

1255
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,300
the most I guess headline grabbing a

1256
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,980
solution to what's been happening in

1257
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,440
Iran which is you know Elon Musk saying

1258
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,079
he's going to send starlink to Iran

1259
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:10,380
um this you know seems like you know a a

1260
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,440
perfect solution I guess an ideal

1261
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,359
um but it is a little bit unclear how

1262
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,700
the security and safety of that would

1263
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,160
work um in terms of how you know Uplink

1264
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,079
connections for satellite internet would

1265
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,780
be detected and would lead to you know

1266
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,300
severe offline repression of anyone with

1267
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,460
starlink in Iran

1268
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,619
um what I do think the focus should be

1269
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:35,280
is on circumvention technology so how do

1270
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,920
we develop tools to address what Iran is

1271
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,940
doing

1272
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,859
um you know there's been Mallory was

1273
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:43,140
noting she was reading a report about

1274
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,960
how there's been you know

1275
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,680
um

1276
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,500
uh Imports of this kind of Technology

1277
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,420
from China to really Advance what

1278
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,980
they're doing to attacks or convention

1279
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,480
tools and so how um should we be helping

1280
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,700
Iranians kind of join this

1281
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,920
um battle against very sophisticated

1282
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,480
attacks

1283
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,240
um sophisticated anti-censorship attacks

1284
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,520
and so there's I think a lot of

1285
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,740
different things that can be done

1286
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,440
um one of the things that we have been

1287
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,619
looking at is the opportunities that

1288
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:20,040
have been been made available with a

1289
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,680
particular

1290
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,559
law in the United States which is

1291
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:28,619
um Tech sanctions have been loosened at

1292
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:30,359
the start of this protest so the U.S

1293
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:33,960
treasury basically added cloud computing

1294
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,960
and Cloud platforms to technologies that

1295
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,660
can legally now be made available to

1296
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,180
Iran so things like gcp Google Cloud

1297
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,900
platforms are at the moment blocked in

1298
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,599
Iran from the Google side and of course

1299
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:52,500
things like gcp can easily you know join

1300
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,520
the roster of tools met for fighting

1301
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,960
internet censorship and I mean one of

1302
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,359
the things I've noted is that you know

1303
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,660
Google well the jigsaw made outline VPN

1304
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:10,319
for example it relies on other servers

1305
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,460
to be hosted or used in Iran and so this

1306
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,980
Google VPN itself cannot even rely on

1307
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,040
gcp infrastructure has to rely on

1308
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,900
digital ocean infrastructure which

1309
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,859
consequently also was legally

1310
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:28,260
um you know because of the change in

1311
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,059
regulation it could legally be available

1312
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,940
in Iran technically gcp can be now

1313
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,280
legally made available in Iran but

1314
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,000
Google has been slow to make this change

1315
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,859
um so that's one of the things

1316
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:43,200
we have been focused on

1317
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,599
um in terms of ensuring that things like

1318
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,300
Google and Amazon and Microsoft can you

1319
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,880
know adjust to these new regulations and

1320
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,920
help um in this fight

1321
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,900
um of course all of these Cloud

1322
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,380
providers could have facilitated

1323
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,760
circumvention Tech through domain

1324
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,260
fronting

1325
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,540
um some of you might know in 2018 domain

1326
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,780
fronting was closed down there's a wide

1327
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,520
array of reasons I guess for why this

1328
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,800
was closed down but at the time there

1329
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,980
was a push to work with these companies

1330
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,380
so that they would basically stop

1331
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,000
complying with the sanctions that

1332
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,760
blocked their services in Iran

1333
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,040
um and make domain fun uh domain

1334
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,740
fronting functional most famously signal

1335
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:29,400
use the Google app engine for its

1336
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,559
um circumvention strategy but of course

1337
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:33,900
that was disbanded when domain fronting

1338
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,920
was um disabled by all three companies

1339
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,180
um and so these are some of the

1340
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,819
recommendations that we have I'm sure a

1341
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:43,380
group full of Engineers and

1342
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,780
technologists would have more

1343
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,420
recommendations and I hope all your

1344
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,660
expertise can help join this uh battle

1345
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,720
for internet freedom in Iran thank you

1346
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,470
thank you Masa

1347
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:01,619
[Applause]

1348
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,359
so we do have a bit of time if folks

1349
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,920
want to get in the queue and share all

1350
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,599
of your ideas

1351
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,480
um for how to do for convention better

1352
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,920
um or other comments or questions you

1353
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,220
might have

1354
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,940
uh Phil humbaker I'd like to listen

1355
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:22,200
um I want to know all your requirements

1356
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,240
in depth

1357
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,480
um as much information as possible

1358
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,599
I think in terms of the standards

1359
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:31,920
process

1360
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,520
we have to think in terms of two buckets

1361
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,700
in that anything we do is going to be

1362
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,420
subject to counter circumvention

1363
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,280
and you know there was the old thing of

1364
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,819
one war one rifle

1365
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:50,099
and so as soon as we had tour and the

1366
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:53,220
original uh democracy protests after the

1367
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,680
stolen election Iran you know they

1368
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,180
basically worked out how to get through

1369
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,319
tour

1370
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,180
and then we saw the attacks on did you

1371
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,420
notar and my company at the time Komodo

1372
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,720
uh that came out of that

1373
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,460
um I think that we need to think of two

1374
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,780
separate tracks

1375
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,300
one developing cryptographic security

1376
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,220
Technologies

1377
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,640
and the second of which is

1378
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,140
steganographic Technologies

1379
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,119
in that we've got you're not going to be

1380
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,619
able to standardize the

1381
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:24,960
anti-circumvention technology that's

1382
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,980
going to have to be something that's

1383
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,099
agile and keeps changing and responding

1384
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:31,680
to the adversary

1385
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,140
however the cryptographic technology

1386
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,960
there we can provide you with some

1387
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,480
building blocks that should help go

1388
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,980
through the uh then the stagnography can

1389
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,319
operate on

1390
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,119
um and you know Quicks won't start on

1391
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:49,980
that uh I've got a

1392
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,260
slightly more hard-boiled

1393
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,540
um traffic analysis uh resistant

1394
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,059
approach

1395
00:58:57,059 --> 00:58:59,819
um we can maybe go further but that

1396
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:01,500
might be how we can kind of like do a

1397
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,339
standards component that is reusable

1398
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:06,780
but there's always going to have to be

1399
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,119
some tactical development on the

1400
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,140
stagnographic front

1401
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,720
yep cheers go ahead

1402
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:26,819
hi I just I think uh just mentioned just

1403
00:59:26,819 --> 00:59:28,440
tour wasn't explicitly mentioned in

1404
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,839
these slides here but uh it seems

1405
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,579
traditionally being a place where tour

1406
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:34,799
is used and it's still used like right

1407
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,079
now I mean if you look in the on the

1408
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:38,700
Tour website there are there is this

1409
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,319
sort of a fair number of users who are

1410
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,059
still using there are certain

1411
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:44,280
kind of connection technique transports

1412
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,920
uh that have been blocked but not all of

1413
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,619
them have like Snowflake and uh OBS V4

1414
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:52,559
and all that are possible but as as you

1415
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,020
say it's like a continual battle so

1416
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,400
anyway yeah

1417
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,140
um first those were two great talks

1418
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,640
thank you for inviting them and thank

1419
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,220
you for coming and talking to us

1420
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,240
um

1421
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,920
so Philip said some interesting things

1422
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,420
and I think sort of there is a role for

1423
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,520
the iitf here but it's already irtf here

1424
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,780
but it's not necessarily like

1425
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,780
standardizing anything right but

1426
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,880
um there are people that that are sort

1427
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,160
of looking at machine generating

1428
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,960
circumvention techniques I think we

1429
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,460
might have even given them an applied

1430
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,839
networking research price a while ago

1431
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,660
but so those things were basically try

1432
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,140
to learn about weaknesses in this in in

1433
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,960
the inspection and blocking Technologies

1434
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,079
by creatively using our protocols and

1435
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,359
and you know basically playing with the

1436
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:45,720
headers playing with a packet traces

1437
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,059
um to to confuse those boxes right and

1438
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:49,859
it's an arms race so the standard

1439
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:52,140
doesn't make sense but a forum for

1440
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,119
discussing this like bringing people

1441
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:56,700
together to build these and evasion

1442
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:57,839
techniques

1443
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,339
with the people that understand the

1444
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:01,200
protocols very deeply might be an

1445
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,980
interesting experiment

1446
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,200
talk a little bit about what

1447
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,839
um I've seen also to point people to a

1448
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:15,180
draft that is

1449
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,760
um in the Privacy research group on

1450
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,079
censorship

1451
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:22,319
um techniques so that was also noted

1452
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,059
over the course of its development maybe

1453
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,900
seven years that it changes all the time

1454
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,640
um but it's useful to write it down it's

1455
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,299
useful to talk about it I think that we

1456
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:36,540
do have examples of work that ietf does

1457
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:39,960
on maybe standardizing Frameworks within

1458
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,540
which people work I don't know a lot

1459
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,339
about Yang but I get the idea that

1460
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:47,040
that's kind of what it's about and I

1461
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,599
would say that the work that the

1462
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:51,359
community has done so so

1463
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,160
um sort of the Civil Society Community

1464
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,500
the folks that are really trying to keep

1465
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,059
the internet on for everybody all over

1466
01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:59,460
the world they're definitely two strong

1467
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,859
camps there are those that measure the

1468
01:02:01,859 --> 01:02:04,020
censorship like uni and Simona and

1469
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,700
others and then there are the folks that

1470
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,740
are building tools or

1471
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:10,799
um tool Bridges or things like that to

1472
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,660
actually respond to exactly the thing

1473
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,819
that you've um all identified which is

1474
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:18,299
that it's a moving Target and what some

1475
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:19,799
of those things are called it's a

1476
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:21,119
general bucket it doesn't necessarily

1477
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,799
mean any one specific tools plugable

1478
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:25,920
transports where you have things like

1479
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,900
you know tour maybe doesn't work but

1480
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,240
something like snowflake is sitting on

1481
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,099
top of tour to help people get on it

1482
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:33,480
better and then once you're on the

1483
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,660
network then it's harder to be

1484
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,299
um it's harder for your traffic to to be

1485
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:41,700
seen and things like that so that work

1486
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,400
happens I think it would be great

1487
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,920
actually to have it happen in the ietf

1488
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,559
OR to figure out how to bring that

1489
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:51,359
Community here more often so that they

1490
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,819
can get the critical feedback

1491
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:56,280
um from you all who are simultaneously

1492
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,700
developing whole protocols like quick

1493
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,559
um but then also might be swept up in

1494
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:03,660
this problem where just the protocol

1495
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,460
itself is getting blocked something I

1496
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,400
think is fairly a new trend

1497
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,040
um in censorship is to just block Things

1498
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,780
based on protocol that's new we don't

1499
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,180
want that to happen so how can we

1500
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,640
um how can we also mitigate that issue

1501
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,920
so yeah anyway thanks so much masa for

1502
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,760
coming

1503
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,859
um thanks everyone for your feedback and

1504
01:03:22,859 --> 01:03:25,140
attendance and I think we're closing out

1505
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:29,720
the IAB meeting for this session thanks

1506
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,020
as well thank you for all your work

1507
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,980
I like

1508
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,020
totally misplaced my charger which is

1509
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,400
such a rookie thing to do
