coordinate all of the new participant

67
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,740
activities so you'll hear from her

68
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,240
towards the end about what some of the

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,979
specific new participant targeted

70
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,300
activities are

71
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,759
so with that this presentation has four

72
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,160
parts uh the first part is an overview

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,160
of the ietf the second is an

74
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,020
introduction to the ietf meeting week so

75
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,940
it's in general what you would find in a

76
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,460
meeting week the third is an overview of

77
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,199
some of the resources that are important

78
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,560
including the people and the tools some

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,820
of the information that you need and

80
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,199
then finally the new participant

81
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,820
activities

82
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,419
um this is not a history of the ietf

83
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,500
it's not everything that you would ever

84
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,300
need to know about the ietf it's just

85
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,460
enough for you to get started

86
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,120
um

87
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,780
so the um as we say here the scope of

88
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,580
this presentation is general information

89
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,720
to get you started in the ietf and

90
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,800
hopefully the information will be

91
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,539
immediately useful to you

92
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,460
if at the end of this you find that

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,560
there's specific things that you

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,600
uh would really have liked to have known

95
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,120
if you could give us uh either there's

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
going to be a feedback session later in

97
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,940
the week you could tell us there or you

98
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,860
could send this email you could catch

99
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,840
any of us in the hallway

100
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,600
um and please please just we need to

101
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,160
know what kinds of information is useful

102
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,180
to help you get started

103
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,539
um

104
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,300
so there is some general housekeeping

105
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,360
uh the first

106
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,300
um thing is the note well they don't

107
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,860
have to say next slide do I they take

108
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,419
you

109
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,340
so the first thing is the ietf note well

110
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,020
and this is basically the set of rules

111
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,139
by which the ietf applies and you

112
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,300
actually when you register for the ietf

113
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,699
you acknowledge that you had agreed to

114
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,919
read and had agreed to abide by all of

115
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,919
these rules this is all of our processes

116
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,500
and our policies

117
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,199
um it's important for an Open Standards

118
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,800
process so it has a lot of IPR types of

119
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,960
implications

120
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,979
and then also if you go to the next

121
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,800
slide it talks about some of our uh how

122
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,259
the processes of how we work

123
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,840
and in particular I would call your note

124
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,539
the harassment procedures and the code

125
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,979
of conduct we'll talk a little bit more

126
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,240
about those

127
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,039
next slide uh item number two uh we used

128
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,160
to do blue sheets and now what we do is

129
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,319
we we are we do need to take attendance

130
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,160
and if you think about especially uh you

131
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,500
know laws around collaboration and Open

132
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,180
Standards process you need to know who's

133
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,520
basically in the room so we don't pass

134
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
around blue sheets anymore and you don't

135
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,539
sign them but what you do need to do is

136
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,180
sign into every meeting if you're online

137
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,340
using meet Echo you're already signed in

138
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,560
but if you're not you're going to see

139
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,639
this QR code in every room so there is a

140
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,740
lightweight meet Echo app

141
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,259
so you need to click on this QR code

142
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,080
and that registers you in this meeting

143
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,580
so I'm not going to count all the heads

144
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,780
here but at the end of this we should

145
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,220
see at least this many people have

146
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,280
attended this meeting so uh Point your

147
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,460
phones now and take the QR code and

148
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,860
you'll see this in every meeting

149
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,380
throughout the rest of the week

150
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,300
and it's pretty lightweight you can also

151
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,560
do it online if you're going to if

152
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,880
you're already if you're following the

153
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,979
full version of meat echo on your laptop

154
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,500
it'll also register you

155
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,319
um but it's really important to do that

156
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,319
the second thing for that is uh and I

157
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,460
think we talk about it a little bit

158
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,880
later in this is uh it the lightweight

159
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,400
app also allows you to join the queue

160
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,680
and one of the things that uh we do is

161
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,319
we queue for questions and we give the

162
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,240
remote participants an equal opportunity

163
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,400
to participate so you will join the

164
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,580
queue by using your app and then you can

165
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,139
go to the microphone

166
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,900
so with that everybody has registered

167
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,820
for this meeting at this point

168
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,399
so the second question oh look is how to

169
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,219
ask questions during a meeting and this

170
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,200
is the main echo or made Echo light made

171
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,520
echolite is the one on your phone

172
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,440
regular meat Echo is the one on your

173
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,260
laptop uh or if you're online obviously

174
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,940
from home you'll be watching it online

175
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,800
and you'll do it there you need to put

176
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,959
yourself into the queue

177
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,420
the tool can automatically detect

178
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,420
whether you are uh in person or remote

179
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,899
and so if there's a long list of people

180
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,279
you can put yourself in the queue and

181
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,899
then you can leisurely walk up to the

182
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,380
microphone and get in the queue and then

183
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,940
another thing to remember is please

184
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,740
slowly state your name

185
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,800
uh every time you join the queue

186
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,660
I think Michelle wants me to move faster

187
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,360
what do you think

188
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,279
um the next thing is you will know we do

189
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,200
uh we did a community consultation on

190
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
the coveted rules uh and the the rules

191
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,360
that we have in place are the rules that

192
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,240
the general Community agreed to so we

193
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,740
are requiring everybody except the

194
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,000
people that are speaking at the front of

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,440
the room

196
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,680
um to wear a mask so uh please do wear

197
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,760
your mask

198
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,040
uh if you have any concerns about being

199
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,480
ill there are free tests available

200
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,980
through the Secretariat at their

201
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,040
registration desk go by and get one if

202
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,300
you test positive you can please notify

203
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,800
the staff that you're positive and they

204
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
will provide support to you and then

205
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,720
stay away from the meeting if you are

206
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,540
sick with covid or anything else it's uh

207
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,980
you know please stay away from the

208
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,300
meeting

209
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,080
um

210
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,000
the final thing that I'm going to go

211
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,339
backwards just one second

212
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,459
the um there are some pins that also

213
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,940
indicate uh if you are comfortable with

214
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,920
you know handshakes or hugs or if you

215
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,360
would rather people to maintain their

216
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,060
distance so if you see the the stack of

217
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,420
like uh oh let's see Michelle is wearing

218
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,760
a green square that means that she is

219
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,459
okay for people to come up and give her

220
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:30,899
a big hug because they haven't seen her

221
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,300
in a couple years if you see somebody

222
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,880
with a red thing uh you know sort of

223
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,500
away from the distance and say hey great

224
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,560
to see you but maintain your distance

225
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,820
um you know everybody is coming from a

226
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,260
different place where cobit is concerned

227
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,540
and we want to be respectful of how uh

228
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,000
different people feel

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,720
and uh so with that

230
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,519
new participants overview I'm going to

231
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,320
provide the overview of the ietf next

232
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,700
slide

233
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,680
so the first thing is the ITF Mission

234
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,360
the ITF Mission just to make the

235
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,279
internet better by producing high

236
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,899
quality relevant technical standards

237
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,579
that influence the way people design and

238
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,800
use and manage the internet

239
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,399
um

240
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,500
and so

241
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,779
the whole point of all of this is making

242
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,480
standards that support the internet next

243
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,160
slide

244
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,219
um

245
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,440
there we go there are some very basic

246
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,620
principles of the ietf the first one is

247
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,360
that anybody can participate you don't

248
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,399
need to attend in person you don't need

249
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,680
to pay a fee everyone can participate

250
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,720
all of the work that's produced by the

251
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,899
ietf is available for free and you can

252
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,700
find it in the internet drafts

253
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,060
repository and in the RSC Repository

254
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,060
the contributions are judged on

255
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,220
technical merits

256
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,380
that's a pretty high bar to strive for

257
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,079
but that's that's the objective and uh

258
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,120
the success is by voluntary deployment

259
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,459
so we have no power to require standards

260
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,860
I mean governments and various profiles

261
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,420
may do that but we actually don't

262
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,720
require standards for deployment

263
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,640
um and so a standard that is ultimately

264
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,140
successful is one that has found

265
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,899
deployment uh in the real world next

266
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,420
slide

267
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,779
so as I mentioned the ietf is a

268
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,700
standards development organization

269
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,339
uh it's a self-selected individual

270
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,959
participants so you know you don't have

271
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,240
a formal membership by company it's

272
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,120
driven by market-based adoptions focused

273
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,220
on internet Technologies it's also

274
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,160
Bottoms Up so um

275
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,380
there's no formal voting we'll talk a

276
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,880
little bit later about what it means to

277
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,279
achieve ietf consensus but there's no

278
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,320
formal voting and there's no formal

279
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,180
government role governments are allowed

280
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,800
to participate just like anybody else

281
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,940
but they are participants and don't have

282
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,260
any special standing also this week is a

283
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,000
meeting it's a working meeting and so

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,440
it's not like a conference that you

285
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,760
might go to so you're not going to see

286
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,220
booths or sales promotions or any other

287
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,380
sales related activities because this is

288
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,040
a working meeting

289
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,200
all right so the big picture

290
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,940
the um

291
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,940
ITF has a number of bodies associated

292
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,100
with it that sort of fall under the

293
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,920
umbrella uh the biggest is the set of

294
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,740
working groups and so on the right of

295
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,240
this slide you see the internet

296
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,100
engineering Steering group

297
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,500
and that's made up of the leaders of all

298
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,440
of the various areas and all of the

299
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,240
working groups are lumped into areas and

300
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,620
so that piece right there is the

301
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,560
engineering part of the ietf

302
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,260
the pink part is the internet research

303
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,160
Steering group and the irtf

304
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,920
so the irtf are all of the research

305
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,100
groups that do work that is not quite

306
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,220
ready for engineering

307
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,959
but might evolve to that point someday

308
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,360
there's also a measurements research

309
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,600
group there's a privacy research group

310
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,459
there's a human rights protocol

311
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,399
considerations research group so the

312
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,760
work that's not really

313
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,920
chartered to work on specific standards

314
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,320
might fall into the research group

315
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,300
there is an internet architecture board

316
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,540
and this is made up of a set of people

317
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,399
selected through the nomcom process

318
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,500
which is our way of nominating our

319
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,519
leadership

320
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,740
and that board provides overall

321
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,860
architectural discussion and it also

322
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,620
manages all of the external Liaisons for

323
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,320
the ietf so any relationships that we

324
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,459
have with the itu or IEEE and so it sort

325
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,820
of is the external facing portion of the

326
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,560
ietf

327
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,339
and then finally there is the LLC which

328
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,800
was the black box there and that's the

329
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,320
administrative side of the ietf so there

330
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,260
is an LLC board also selected through

331
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,880
the nomcom process

332
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,199
and that board works on

333
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,720
the uh you know signing all the

334
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,300
contracts that support the structure you

335
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,339
know negotiating Hotel contracts

336
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,680
negotiating the contracts with

337
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,240
um all of the entities that support the

338
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,540
ietf so if it's legal

339
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,720
um or contractual it's in the purview of

340
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,940
the LLC

341
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,440
okay uh so next is

342
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,300
I had mentioned briefly that there was a

343
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,440
bunch of working groups that were

344
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,660
organized into areas so here are the

345
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,180
areas currently in the iatf these do

346
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,100
change over time depending on what the

347
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,800
current body of work is but they we

348
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,320
currently have seven areas

349
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,600
we have applications in real time so

350
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
things like HTTP fall here also all of

351
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,899
your sip protocols and and webrtc the

352
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,639
real-time conferencing type applications

353
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,820
fall into art area

354
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,940
um the transport area so this is really

355
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,560
if you think TCP

356
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,860
UDP and quick these are all transport

357
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,959
area protocols

358
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,620
um

359
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,800
the routing area does all of the routing

360
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,860
protocols in the ietf

361
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,500
and the internet area does

362
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:19,139
uh IPv6 ipv4 DNH DHCP my favorite ntp so

363
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,880
there are a number of protocols in that

364
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,800
area that fall into that group

365
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,899
operations and management

366
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,699
um that was really two areas that

367
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,560
eventually got combined into one so if

368
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,000
you think of netconf and all of the

369
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,199
modules for doing management type

370
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,480
activities those fall in there and also

371
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,339
operations groups so like for example

372
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,339
there is an IPv6 operations working

373
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:42,240
group

374
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,579
uh that's looking at the operation of

375
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,339
the IPv6 protocol that would fall into

376
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,500
the operations area there's also a DNS

377
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,699
Ops group

378
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,339
so if you're looking for uh working

379
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,440
groups that are working on deployed

380
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,180
protocols and the operation of those

381
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,920
protocols in the real world and that

382
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,040
would fall into the operations area

383
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,919
there's a security area

384
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,540
and as you can well imagine the security

385
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,640
area actually sort of intersects all of

386
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,199
these areas because security is

387
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,660
important to all of them

388
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,599
um but uh you know like the TLs protocol

389
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,339
ipsec

390
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:21,540
um the Eep extensions radius extensions

391
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,939
those types of protocols all fall into

392
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,699
the security area

393
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:28,319
and finally there's a general area so

394
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,780
general area usually is doing things

395
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,419
like processes I think there's a working

396
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,220
group meeting this week as an as an

397
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,080
example of this the elegy working group

398
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,480
which is actually about the eligibility

399
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,880
requirements to participate in the

400
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,679
nom-com process that I have mentioned

401
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,260
before that selects the leadership so we

402
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,400
have an RFC that documents the how we

403
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,919
select our leadership and how you can

404
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,840
participate in that process

405
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,760
we need to update that and there's a

406
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,140
working group that's been established to

407
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,880
do that those kinds of working groups

408
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,640
will fall into the general area

409
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,280
next slide

410
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,500
so this slide

411
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,460
talks a little bit about the leadership

412
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,400
among the various groups

413
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,799
and if you go later on we're going to

414
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,059
talk a little bit more about individual

415
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,000
people but there's basically for the

416
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,100
ietf itself there's the general chair of

417
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,940
the ietf if you attend the plenary on

418
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,220
Wednesday evening you'll note that Lars

419
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,780
Eggert is a gentleman who will be

420
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,059
chairing that so that's the

421
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:30,720
um

422
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,000
and he's also the general area director

423
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,820
in the ietf

424
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,559
so

425
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,320
Lars is the ietf general chair

426
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,360
each of those areas that I just talked

427
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,580
about those seven areas they have two

428
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,179
maybe three area directors and uh and

429
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,400
then each working group within an area

430
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,000
has two maybe three working group chairs

431
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,100
and those links there show you who that

432
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,720
body who those settings of people are

433
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,340
like so who's the who's the members of

434
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,900
the isg and who are the various working

435
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,419
group chairs are

436
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,480
in the IAB you have a chair of the IAB

437
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,240
that's currently Mary Coleman

438
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,940
um and she will also be

439
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,799
on the plenary talking about IAB

440
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,080
activities she'll also be co-chairing

441
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,940
there's an IAB open meeting tomorrow

442
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,120
evening I believe from 3 30 to 5 30 or 4

443
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,900
30 to 5 30. I know it ends at 5 30. on

444
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,799
Tuesday

445
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,600
so she'll be one of the co-chairs of

446
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,640
that and she is the chair current chair

447
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,100
of the IAB

448
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,520
um and then the um

449
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,400
uh then the members of the ieb are

450
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,260
selected again through the nam-com

451
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,960
process they tend to be uh individuals

452
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,460
who have been around the ietf for a

453
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,260
little bit of time have some experience

454
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,900
in in Broad overarching issues and they

455
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,120
participate in the IAB

456
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,299
um

457
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,879
the irtf the research task force

458
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,539
has a chair that chair is selected

459
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:04,860
through the IAB

460
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,960
and the irtf chair is currently a

461
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,940
gentleman named Colin Perkins

462
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,760
there is an irtf open meeting this week

463
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,320
it usually has a couple of invited

464
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,700
speakers along with other topics and

465
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,900
it has a set of irsg it has an irst a

466
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,480
Steering group for the irtf and those

467
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,580
are generally made up of chairs of the

468
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,620
various research groups and invited

469
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,480
participants it's a little bit less

470
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,320
formal than the uh iesg

471
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,600
um so I hinted a little bit earlier that

472
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,220
we were going to talk about ietf and

473
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,260
consensus

474
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,919
um

475
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,100
the uh

476
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,320
Mantra I guess of the ietf is that we

477
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,059
reject King's presidents and votings we

478
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,500
believe in rough consensus and running

479
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,039
code and this has been around for at

480
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,720
least 30 years

481
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,480
the key Point here being that

482
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,080
um

483
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,539
rough consensus is when you get all of

484
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,840
the issues have been discussed

485
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,100
but they're not necessarily all been

486
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,620
accommodated so at some point you need

487
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,900
to move forward

488
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,419
and so you you hear everybody's opinion

489
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,640
that you analyze what they've brought

490
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,840
forward

491
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,179
uh but you at some point make a decision

492
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,100
and you move forward

493
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,500
um we use a lot of times the hackathon

494
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,240
and the code that's built there to help

495
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,120
us with some of that achieving of rough

496
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,799
consensus

497
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,900
and then one of the things that

498
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,520
people I think sometimes find the most

499
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,460
odd about the iitf is we hum to

500
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,200
determine consensus

501
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,520
they think well

502
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,500
humming is kind of an odd process but if

503
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,600
you just take a step back and you think

504
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,360
in terms of humming is a way to measure

505
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,640
the rough idea of the number of people

506
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,159
in a room that support something and how

507
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,039
passionately they support it so if you

508
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,500
say you know how many people approve the

509
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,020
adoption of this draft and you get sort

510
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,520
of a quiet hum

511
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
then you know well

512
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,039
you know maybe maybe people were okay

513
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,900
with it but they're not that strong a

514
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,960
supporter of it so humming gives you a

515
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,860
way to uh measure the differences

516
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,500
without actually voting

517
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,240
um and that way people that have a

518
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,280
stronger vested interest people that you

519
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,900
know have experimented people that have

520
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,600
actually read the draft uh can have a

521
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,039
stronger opinion expressed but it's

522
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,600
really just a tool for measuring

523
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,919
consensus

524
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,140
uh it's not a

525
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,179
you know it's not required in all cases

526
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,980
you can sometimes determine consensus in

527
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,260
a working group without uh without

528
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,419
humming you can ask you know how many

529
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,039
people have read the draft and how many

530
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,320
people think the draft is ready to be

531
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,539
accepted

532
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:46,260
um

533
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,059
one of the chief obligations of a

534
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,679
working group co-chair is to determine

535
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,600
the consensus in the working group and

536
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,539
so we do that by looking at you know the

537
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,600
the response in the room we also look at

538
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,220
the traffic on the mailing list and any

539
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,280
uh you know final decisions on on major

540
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,679
consensus calls are taken back to the

541
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,380
mailing list so that anybody that uh

542
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,260
feels uh they have an opinion on the

543
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,659
subject can express it in that consensus

544
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:17,760
process

545
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,440
um there is actually as in all things

546
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,659
ietf there is an RFC that talks about

547
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,240
consensus and humming uh written written

548
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,340
by uh Pete Resnick so you can learn more

549
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,760
about iatf and iitf consensus processes

550
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,140
in that RFC

551
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,280
um

552
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,860
so most people that come to the ietf do

553
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,179
so because they want to join a working

554
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,020
group and contribute to existing work

555
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,320
and there's sort of a real basic outline

556
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,200
here of how you uh would contribute to

557
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,299
that work

558
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,440
a little bit later in this presentation

559
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,880
we're going to talk about a tool called

560
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,000
the data tracker so

561
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,559
datatracker.ietf.org that's really the

562
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,679
the the core of all of the ietf work you

563
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,140
can find all of the documents there you

564
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,640
can find links to all of the mailing

565
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,980
lists there and you can find information

566
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,100
about every working group there

567
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,200
so if you look at this picture on the

568
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,120
right here you see like the about the

569
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,679
documents the meeting the history of the

570
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,960
photos so every working group has a data

571
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,940
tracker page and all of the information

572
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,520
about that working group is on that data

573
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,919
tracker page so you can see the charter

574
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,600
and the milestones and everything else

575
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,460
that you need to do one of the first

576
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,900
things that if you want to contribute to

577
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,340
a mailing list that you need to do is to

578
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,960
join want to contribute to a working

579
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,600
group is to join the mailing list

580
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,120
and then from that you can see which

581
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,520
documents are currently in in progress

582
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,120
if you uh we can't do it here but if you

583
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,100
clicked on that documents link that

584
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,780
documents tab right there it's going to

585
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,059
tell you what the currently adopted

586
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,760
documents in the working group are what

587
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,500
the published documents in the working

588
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,600
group are and what the individual

589
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,460
submissions are that have been sent to

590
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,380
the working group but have not been

591
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,799
adopted yet so those are the three major

592
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,380
categories that you're going to see and

593
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,020
so that way you can figure out and then

594
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,179
you know if the if the working group

595
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,520
chair has is organized and has properly

596
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,140
done all of their work in advance of

597
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,480
their meeting when you go to the agenda

598
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,120
page on data tracker it'll show you

599
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,340
which documents have been linked for

600
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,740
discussion in that meeting

601
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,240
um some working group chairs are a

602
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,380
little bit better about getting that

603
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,559
done in advance than others but um when

604
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,059
you then when you look at the meet Echo

605
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,740
you'll be able to also see what are the

606
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,360
documents that have been assigned to be

607
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,640
discussed at this meeting

608
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,419
um

609
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,460
so with that if you also if you have any

610
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,720
questions you can find out who the

611
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,039
chairs of the working group are and you

612
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,539
can contact them and ask them any

613
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:46,500
questions

614
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,080
uh next slide

615
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,059
so this is a lot the other thing a lot

616
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,679
of times new participants want to do in

617
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,500
the ietf is to talk about

618
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,200
um how new work starts up and you you

619
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,640
come with some ideas and you want to

620
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,159
start some work uh so this is sort of

621
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,480
the high level one and the next slide

622
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,740
will provide you a couple links that

623
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,140
will be uh useful so basically the first

624
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,760
step is you have the idea and community

625
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,500
building part

626
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,340
um the iitf is contribution driven so

627
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,980
um you know one of the things I hear a

628
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,419
lot is somebody comes and says you know

629
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,059
you should do this or you know the ietf

630
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,559
should do this well that's true but

631
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,480
somebody has to actually write the

632
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,220
initial contributions to drive the work

633
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,500
so it is contribution driven it's

634
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,880
bottoms up

635
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,980
and so somebody has identified a problem

636
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,360
that needs to be solved or something

637
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,880
that they they feel that they can solve

638
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,760
if it fits within the ietf the the

639
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,640
charter of the ietf and it aligns with

640
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,100
the way we want to work

641
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,559
then it might get spun up as a working

642
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,840
group

643
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,179
and there's a lot more detail in here

644
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:52,919
than is you know presented here this is

645
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,039
sort of the the high level uh way of

646
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,039
looking at it but so you so now you have

647
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,720
a working group process and once the

648
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,820
working group is done it goes to the

649
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,100
iesg and the ietf and there's a whole

650
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,620
set of reviews that happen and then it

651
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,779
goes into the editing process and then

652
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,500
it gets published ultimately as an RFC

653
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,340
the other thing that's really important

654
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,900
on this slide is you need people that

655
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,059
are willing to do the work

656
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,340
it and a lot of times it's not the

657
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,440
people that initially bring the work uh

658
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,480
it's a whole set of people that uh

659
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,460
contribute to completing the work you

660
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,200
know once they've identified and built

661
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,700
that community

662
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,400
so if you go to the next slide

663
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,640
um the um this gives you a little bit

664
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,860
more details on some of the things that

665
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,320
you might want to do uh the key is

666
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,700
obviously you need to write that initial

667
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,500
internet draft and once you have that

668
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,600
initial internet draft you know there's

669
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,100
you might have some informal side

670
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,740
meetings and you'll see in the on the

671
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,539
agenda at the top it talks about the

672
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,580
side meeting Wiki so that side meeting

673
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,820
Wiki gives you the opportunity to um

674
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,919
find out side meetings or schedule your

675
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,500
own site meeting and you can just go

676
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,320
anybody can reserve a chunk of the room

677
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,080
you can set up a side meeting and invite

678
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,679
people to participate in it

679
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,760
then once you've got it a little bit

680
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,080
more mature you talk to the area

681
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,299
directors and they may send it through a

682
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,700
dispatch process or they may send it to

683
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,960
a boss

684
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
and you'll see Rich will talk a little

685
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,760
bit more about boss later birds of a

686
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,980
feather sessions

687
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,440
um and then you would hold the buff

688
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,120
uh and then you might get a working

689
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,580
group Charter or you might get sent to

690
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,799
another working group or or it and they

691
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,179
might decide for whatever reason the

692
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:37,500
work is not far enough along in

693
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,700
development or there's not enough

694
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,980
interest or it's outside the scope of

695
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,440
the ietf then it might move elsewhere

696
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,299
there is a tutorial right now on

697
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,059
bringing new work to the ietf it's a

698
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,860
little bit out of date but it's not too

699
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,419
bad and so I would strongly suggest that

700
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,299
you go to that and take a look at that

701
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,080
um

702
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,299
finally the fund funding model for the

703
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,640
ietf

704
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,380
this is a new slide this time I guess

705
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,940
because we get a fair number of

706
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,140
questions on it so we thought we would

707
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,159
go ahead and

708
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,380
put it in here

709
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,960
um the ITF relies on a number of

710
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,000
different support streams for its work

711
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,340
the cost of the ietf is not just this

712
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,020
meeting obviously it's all of the

713
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,380
infrastructure that supports the ietf

714
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,740
all year long uh and so the sources of

715
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,480
that are the registration fees for this

716
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,460
meeting

717
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,440
donations and there's ways to donate and

718
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,740
there is um a woman here who's the

719
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,140
just lost her title but she basically

720
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,840
does the fundraising for the ietf uh

721
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,100
corporate donation corporate

722
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,539
contributions and sponsorships and

723
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,159
you'll see on the signs who the sponsors

724
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,740
of these meetings are they're invaluable

725
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,080
to helping carry out the work of the

726
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,520
ietf

727
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,559
I think that's the end of my second

728
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:54,059
number oh one last slide in my section

729
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,559
um so let's talk a little bit about the

730
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,080
ietf and the participants

731
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,320
um the ietf is made up of all of you

732
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,940
um it is you know passionate smart and

733
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,159
vocal people sometimes you know we come

734
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,980
from uh all over the world a lot of

735
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,200
different cultures a lot of you know a

736
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,580
lot of different age diversity uh so uh

737
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,659
there's there's a very uh engaged

738
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,520
um obviously we're an informal dress

739
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,399
code type of place uh the the most

740
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,799
valuable thing people consider is a

741
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,500
technical Excellence so please do your

742
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,360
homework first but then feel free to

743
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,460
speak up and contribute please go to the

744
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,559
mic please uh stop people in the hallway

745
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,200
and ask them questions uh and then as

746
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,419
you'll notice you'll observe over time a

747
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:40,679
number of us have been here for a number

748
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,659
of years and people seem to come to the

749
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,520
ietf and once they get engaged in it

750
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,380
they stay with the ietf through multiple

751
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,080
companies so what we're hoping is that

752
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,559
you some some subset of you will become

753
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,559
um our leaders in 10 years so with that

754
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,559
I'm going to hand off to Rich

755
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:59,760
and let him

756
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,360
took

757
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,600
if you don't sit up front you have to

758
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,279
bring your own water okay

759
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,320
uh next slide

760
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,860
I have a cold not covered uh

761
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,980
on a Sudafed okay so

762
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,460
um welcome to the start of the ITF week

763
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,020
um you missed some of the cool things

764
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,620
but I'll talk about them a little bit

765
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,000
the bulk of the meeting is the working

766
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,580
group sessions the ITF is as Karen said

767
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,200
is divided into working groups there's

768
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,080
about 130 right now and a subset of them

769
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,120
are meeting

770
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,659
uh since covid uh the IHF has become

771
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,399
much more

772
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,279
um hybrid originally we'd like at the

773
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,559
last minute we were all just remote and

774
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,659
now it's hybrid at this point it's about

775
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:56,700
50 50 on-site and remote presentations

776
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,220
um last year last two meetings were more

777
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,220
like two to one local versus remote and

778
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,260
it'll probably say 50 50 maybe it'll go

779
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,899
to one to two there's also birds of a

780
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:08,760
feather session as Karen mentioned

781
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,740
those are

782
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,539
often described as working Group

783
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,220
performing Buffs

784
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,840
um that means well we're going to get a

785
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,120
bunch of people together uh we'll figure

786
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,279
out what areas we have in interest of

787
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,480
common interest

788
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,740
um and then we'll make a proposal to

789
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,159
create a working group they are listed

790
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,720
pardon me in your agenda and to say bof

791
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,020
and little green letters afterwards

792
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,460
there are a number of area-wide sessions

793
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,580
the plenary plenary being a Latin word

794
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,500
for meaning for everyone together

795
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,299
surprisingly

796
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,760
um that is where the leadership talks

797
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,940
about here's our finances uh I'll stand

798
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,380
up for five minutes and say Here's

799
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,460
what's going on with the nominations

800
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,899
committee

801
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,480
um often there are technical talks

802
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,279
although not recently

803
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,059
um

804
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,159
there are invited talks there's a deep

805
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,960
dive I think Wednesday morning Tuesday

806
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,220
Morning

807
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,520
um but that's and then each of the areas

808
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,460
often has an area-wide meeting so

809
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,520
there'll be a security area meeting a an

810
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,740
a transport area meeting and so on

811
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,659
that's where things that don't fit into

812
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,519
any of the working groups are discussed

813
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,799
so you have a general interest in a

814
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,019
particular area the area-wide meetings

815
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,059
are a good place to go

816
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,279
um the hackathon is a very very popular

817
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,220
event at the ITF as Karen mentioned

818
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,080
before the Mantra of rough consensus and

819
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,500
running code uh there are about 400

820
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,260
people attending the hackathon uh this

821
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,419
session this meeting

822
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,100
um it's

823
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,019
the Saturday and Sunday before the

824
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,760
meeting so in the future you may want to

825
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,460
consider pushing your your work time

826
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,980
back earlier free

827
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,980
to join there are people who come only

828
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,899
to the hackathon uh you get another

829
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,539
t-shirt and a little free meal

830
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,179
um social events are they are they do do

831
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:58,799
remote participation of those kinds of

832
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,960
things and the plenary and other

833
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,059
sessions are all broadcast Live on

834
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,519
YouTube and recorded and appear in the

835
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,779
iitf channel

836
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,179
on YouTube uh the social events are in

837
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,679
person only

838
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,839
um if you signed up for the attendees

839
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,879
mailing list it is now starting to get

840
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,739
full of hey I need a social ticket

841
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,599
anybody got one because there's always

842
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,239
limited funds for that

843
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,300
um hot rfcs in this case it stands for

844
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,000
request for conversation this is where

845
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,800
somebody would stand up and speak for

846
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,540
five minutes and say hey I have this

847
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,280
great idea or this is the research I'm

848
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,379
working on anybody else interested come

849
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:35,879
see them afterwards

850
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,899
uh side meetings as Karen mentioned are

851
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,580
just informal Gatherings where people

852
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,619
might want to get together to work on a

853
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,239
particular problem that's already in a

854
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,699
working group or discuss something maybe

855
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,440
they should get a boss so it's sort of a

856
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,940
pre-buff off

857
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,859
uh next slide

858
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,239
so this is what a working group session

859
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,760
looked like in the pre-covered days uh

860
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,200
interestingly it looks very much like

861
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,240
this a couple people at the desk the

862
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,700
working group chairs uh somebody who is

863
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,560
designated as a speaker for a particular

864
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,020
part of the session in this case me and

865
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,560
then everybody else in the session

866
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,680
people present at what has changed since

867
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,780
the last meeting unless it's a brand new

868
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,280
piece of work that's being brought to

869
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,859
the working group what that means is if

870
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:21,000
you want to get the most out of a

871
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,579
working group read the documents

872
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,780
um because you're not going to get any

873
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,359
kind of tutorial if it's a new thing

874
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,060
like just being adopted or considered

875
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,339
being adopted by the working group

876
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,140
um that'll that's different but if you

877
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,900
want to know like what's happening in

878
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,500
DNS with the new record type or TLS with

879
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,000
a new extension

880
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,260
um they're only going to describe what

881
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,579
changed since the last time we got

882
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:45,720
together

883
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,060
So reading the documents helps every

884
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,520
session is streamed and recorded the

885
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,640
charter which is set by the iesg all the

886
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,800
area directors limits what the working

887
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,079
group can and should work on the intent

888
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,240
is to keep maintaining Focus we've had

889
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,920
some instances where working groups

890
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,339
extended for five six ten years and we

891
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,560
don't want to do that again uh next

892
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,640
slide

893
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,260
birds of a feather as I mentioned

894
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,000
there's six this time

895
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,040
um usually precedes a working group

896
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,079
sometimes they'll get together and we'll

897
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,000
say oh yeah there's not really going to

898
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,460
be any interest here or oh yeah we could

899
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,720
do this thing but there's already

900
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,339
commercial involvement and they're not

901
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:25,560
going to listen to us so we'll skip it

902
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,540
next

903
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,180
uh research group sessions the irtf

904
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,940
provides a prize for the two best

905
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,420
Publications in networking

906
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,859
this year I forget but one of them is

907
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:41,520
with Corinne Kath her PhD thesis was on

908
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,480
the sociology of the ietf

909
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,280
which is very interesting she had a pub

910
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,020
a paper published from one chapter of

911
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,180
her thesis which was called Old Men

912
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,180
talking loudly in one room

913
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,300
so encouraging uh next

914
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,460
um so this is a picture of what the the

915
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,260
pleneries look like

916
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,099
um

917
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,320
we reserve uh one of the largest

918
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,000
ballroom and they open it all up put in

919
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,560
all the chairs

920
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,839
um and uh again there's a lot of

921
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,359
administration administrivia that's the

922
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,720
term goes but also

923
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,040
it can be worthwhile to attend just to

924
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,540
get an idea of what the scope of things

925
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,820
are and what all of those black boxes

926
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,700
pink boxes red boxes on the org chart

927
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,800
that Karen showed look like

928
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,160
thanks the hackathon uh it's too late

929
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,960
it's cool

930
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,119
um I never go but it is really cool and

931
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,400
you can see there's people

932
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,920
views of tables on all of the on many of

933
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,660
the organizations

934
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,920
um here's where people are trying to

935
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,320
implement the rfcs

936
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,900
um it can be a stellar standard but if

937
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,460
nobody implements it then as far as the

938
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,160
iitf is concerned it's a failure we want

939
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,020
to do things that work and that are

940
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,000
adopted

941
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,560
people will bring Hardware system you

942
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,380
know SBC single board computers for some

943
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,619
of the the trust Zone secure Enclave

944
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:02,839
work was done

945
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,460
at the end of the hackathon there'll be

946
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,260
a presentation about who you know what

947
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,300
each project did there might be a

948
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,880
hackathon winner you know arbitrary

949
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,099
things but it's uh it's a very popular

950
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:17,640
event next and the code Sprint is where

951
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,160
we work on the data tracker

952
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,660
um the most useful thing you can get out

953
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,400
of this session is

954
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,280
data tracker dot ietf.org can be

955
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,579
abbreviated as dt.ietf.org

956
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:32,220
anyone can join the hackathon there is

957
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,859
an RFC that talks about how to run one

958
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:35,460
um

959
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,200
there's a link there at the running code

960
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,839
all of these links are clickable in the

961
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,160
slide presentation that will be

962
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,619
available a month or so within a month

963
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,980
after the meeting this meeting

964
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,440

cold we've had this on the left is at

967
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,099
the Royal aquarium in Singapore

968
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:00,540

969
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,579
up this time it's at the Royal the

970

on the right is a picture of the Sisters

973
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,560
organization that is for women who

974
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,500
people who identify as female I guess is

975
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,900
the way to put it I think it's Monday

976
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,420
morning at 8 30 or 9 30 it is in the

977
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,140
agenda you can just show up if you are

978
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,320

there it is so there's another picture

981
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,320
that's looking down at the hotel lobby

982
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,839
uh general meeting etiquette

983
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,119
um read the document Center of Interest

984
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,339
you can go to a working group meeting

985
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,740
and maybe Intuit some of the things that

986
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,240

like well maybe I'll get lost but maybe

988
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,960
I'll learn something that's good

989
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,820
um in the data tracker for every working

990
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,339
group there is a list of all the

991
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:52,200
documents that are being worked on all

992
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,300
of the rfcs that the working group has

993
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,700
previously published and so on uh

994
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,980
respectfully you know privately you know

995
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,940
be you know an adult right sometimes

999
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,920
you know they'll stand up at the mic

1000
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,020
after someone is presented and say

1001
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,720
that's a really stupid idea

1002
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,980
that's because they've known each other

1003
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,540
for 10 years and they can speak frankly

1004
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,960
okay you can figure out another way to

1005
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,280
say it right

1006
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,800
um talk and listen enjoy yourself uh

1007
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,260
this is going to be a long week it'll be

1008
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,900
a very exhausting week because it's you

1009
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,000
know mental exertion for all of the

1010
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,579
sessions next

1011
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,700
uh online version so meet Echo is the

1012
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,980
video conferencing system we use

1013
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,880
Uh custom build supported by medeco of

1014
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,960
Italy

1015
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,740
um

1016
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,220
we want to have good audio and video uh

1017
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,320
there is a full What's called the full

1018
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,900
and the light version the light version

1019
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,240
is available on your phone app you get

1020
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,220
it when you click on the

1021
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,060
on the QR QR code outside every room

1022
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,760
session the the hotel room has a sign

1023
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,200
that will have the QR code for the

1024
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,660
session that's going on that's also how

1025
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,579
you get in line so people wanted to talk

1026
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,040
they have to click the button that say

1027
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,020
Enter the queue and then the chairs will

1028
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,020
say yes you're next and so on we try to

1029
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,060
be equal between local in-person

1030
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,900
attendance and remote virtual uh in one

1031
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,760
of my groups for example the first

1032
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,859
presenter is going to be remote from New

1033
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:26,700
York

1034
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,160
uh so it's it's sort of like the way

1035
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,720
everybody does video conferencing these

1036
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,980
days

1037
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,400
um zulup is a chat system think of it

1038
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,740
like slack but a little different

1039
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,520
um

1040
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,680
if you have if you registered for the

1041
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,960
meeting you probably have a data tracker

1042
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,200
account and that will be

1043
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,680
a single sign-on for the zulup.ietf.org

1044
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,560
every working group has a zulup room

1045
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,160
think of it and you can do chats during

1046
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,140
the meeting zulup is also integrated

1047
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,300
with meet Echo so if you're using a

1048
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,339
browser and the full client say remotely

1049
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:06,060
there's the you'll see pictures of who's

1050
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,320
speaking

1051
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,500
um the slides and then on the side there

1052
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,380
will be the chat room scrolling by the

1053
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,240
chats are often used for back Channel

1054
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,220
communication like hey what did he just

1055
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,599

RFC editors the documents we publish are

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,700
called rfcs that's a nod back to our

1142
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,000
history when the very first ietf

1143
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,740
documents and it was called the internet

1144
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,560
Engineering Group or something like that

1145
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,339
um

1146
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:41,099
were a grad student put out a paper

1147
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:42,660
saying hey I think this is how a

1148
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,880
computer should connect to the network

1149
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,200
and I don't know what to call it so I'll

1150
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,540
just call it a request for comments

1151
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,380
um we

1152
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,079
keep that history or that nod to history

1153
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,140
um the also the thing is in RFC while it

1154
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,420
never changes it can evolve and a New

1155
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,000
Roc will be published every standard

1156
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,700
that the ietf does as well as

1157
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,619
informational documents independent

1158
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:05,760
submissions

1159
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,119
are all called rfcs the RC editors

1160
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,180
people on the left uh

1161

probably early in your ITF Journey most

1162
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,660
useful to swing by and grab a candy

1163
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,859
right

1164
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:23,220
it it's great I first three days I'm I

1165
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,079
say hi and I don't take any candy by

1166
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,960
Thursday I'm like give me the candy so

1167
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,599
Ayanna are the people who assign the

1168
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,280
what's called Reserve numbers if you

1169
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,680
look at ianna.org for example many

1170
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,180
protocols

1171
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,880
have a space in them for extension

1172
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,359
Fields additional data and so on so uh

1173
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:44,339
for the most common example might be the

1174
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,960
TCP port number right so 80 is the web

1175
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,920
443 is the web over TLS uh

1176
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,619
53 is a DNS

1177
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:57,839
and those numbers have to be maintained

1178
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,880
in a central place and the rules for

1179
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,319
assigning them are determined by the

1180
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,440
ietf but Ayanna keeps track of all of

1181
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,119
them so we don't have two people trying

1182
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,980
to get the same you know use the same

1183
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,480
port number

1184
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,220
um also very friendly and that's an old

1185
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,380
picture right because you're there yeah

1186
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,020
Michelle moved from okay

1187
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,300
yeah we need a new picture um the ombuds

1188
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,900
team uh as I mentioned more than once

1189
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,480
the ITF members have known each other

1190
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,640
and worked together for a long time they

1191
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,140
might be more free with the language

1192
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,640
than you would expect

1193
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,819
new people to to recognize but we don't

1194
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,819
like harassment and we don't tolerate it

1195
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,440
so

1196
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,619
um if you are concerned

1197
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:43,440
um you go to the ombuds team I know Pete

1198
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,520
is here

1199
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,260
he's got long white hair and a ponytail

1200
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,020
and his he makes me look makes me look

1201
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,300
taller than Maverick and I'm not sure if

1202
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,000
Melinda or Allison are here yet but or

1203
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,859
you can speak to any of the leadership

1204
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,440
or

1205
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,359
the AMS down at the bottom you know down

1206
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:02,819
at the registration area in same house

1207
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:06,000
reporting issues as I said we take it we

1208
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,220
take reports very seriously

1209
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,380
um you'll often see in the note well

1210
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,619
which is our rules about

1211
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:14,700
um

1212
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,859
patents and things like that

1213
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:19,859
um but ultimately uh it'll say you know

1214
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:22,380
be good because be excellent to each

1215
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,319
other right this is a engineering

1216
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,880
organization engineering oriented

1217
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,520
organization trying to make the internet

1218
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,560
work better by doing high quality

1219
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,319
standards that are implemented and so

1220
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,839
there's sometimes you know push and pull

1221
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:40,020
and tugs of War so we want to be able to

1222
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,540
do that without crossing the line into

1223
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,480
abusive or harassing Behavior

1224
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,900
fixed the knock uh one thing you'll

1225
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,839
notice especially if you're at the hotel

1226
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:53,339
the quality of the network here is

1227
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:54,780
pretty amazing

1228
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,520
I remember in one place uh I was in

1229
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,000
Montreal which is all the hotels and so

1230
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,680
on are connected by tunnels and there's

1231
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,900
a big underground shopping center and

1232
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,420
someone said I don't know what this iatf

1233
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,200
hotel is but boy do they have good Wi-Fi

1234
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,960
and they do and we do um the P the

1235
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,359
volunteers who and paid staff who run

1236
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:21,119
the network operations center uh they

1237
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,339
did a they do a yeoman job they come in

1238
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:25,619
the week before they run cables there's

1239
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:27,839
Wi-Fi access points in every single room

1240
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,500
we take over the hotel's Wi-Fi so it's

1241
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,200
free right no fifteen dollars and seven

1242
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,000
pounds a day or whatever

1243
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,560
um there's a printer and a help desk

1244
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,680
near the registration area if you need

1245
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,420
to print out you know your boarding pass

1246
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,480
or a document that you need to you know

1247
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,040
you want some notes to present at a

1248
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,920
working group that's where you can go

1249
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,500
they did an amazing job the for those

1250
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,839
who don't know the hotel lost power

1251
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:57,900
uh yesterday morning for a few minutes

1252
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,300
um and then what happened is the on the

1253
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,920
power supplies kicked in the batteries

1254
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,560
kicked in and so all was fine

1255
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,940
um and then when the power came up the

1256
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,839
first thing that happened is the

1257
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,400
batteries wanted the UPS wanted to

1258
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,260
recharge and so it blew a circuit

1259
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,900
breaker and the network stayed up more

1260
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,099
or less throughout all of that so

1261
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:16,500
they're very intensive people

1262
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,140
next mailing lists

1263
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,380
uh the ietf works on mailing lists the

1264
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,960
meetings are designed to get together we

1265
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,880
meet three times a year the meetings are

1266
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,380
designed to get together and hash out

1267
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,700
things that can't be addressed on

1268
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,099
mailing lists obviously email you know

1269
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:33,839
you often end up talking past each other

1270
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,880
or you're not clear particularly as a

1271
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,760
global organization where English

1272
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,099
is not everybody's first language and

1273
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:42,480
Technical English is even less

1274
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,720
everybody's first language but um

1275
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,640
you know we want to present we presented

1276
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,260
the meetings what's happened since and

1277
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,839
so on and then you'll often hear

1278
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,940
um at a working group session

1279
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,880
people there'll be some discussion and

1280
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,579
we'll say okay how many people uh think

1281
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:01,140
that this is a good feature please hum

1282
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,660
now you hear a hum

1283
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,339
um and then the chairs will say okay

1284
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:06,839
we'll confirm that on the mailing list

1285
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,760
and what that means is they'll go back

1286
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,339
to the email list after the ITF week and

1287
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,500
say at the meeting we decided you know

1288
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,420
we came to the consensus that this is a

1289
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,119
good feature does anybody object so

1290
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:19,500
every all of the official business

1291
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,599
happens on the mailing list the mailing

1292
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,460
lists are archived they've been subject

1293
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,500
to subpoenas who was in the room has

1294
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,599
been subject to subpoenas but it's a you

1295
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,520
know we generally don't care about all

1296
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,900
of those things

1297
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,300
um if you just scan the QR code you're

1298
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,040
all set

1299
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,599
um every working group has a mailing

1300
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,460
list sure leave it that's fine

1301
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,720
um oh my group uh data tracker

1302
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,720
dt.itf.org this is a the status page uh

1303
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,420
for the transport TLS Security Group

1304
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:51,480
it's no longer SSL right nobody runs SSL

1305
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,780
anymore right right okay good

1306
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,780
um the first tab is about that'll show

1307
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,400
um here's the group here's the charter

1308
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,319
of things are set to do a group can

1309
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,780
change its Charter to add new things for

1310
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,000
example the crypto groups recently got

1311
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,059
recharged to address post Quantum crypto

1312
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,280
right stuff like that here's a list of

1313
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,619
all the documents the current drafts

1314
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:16,020
um the status is the most important

1315
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,260
thing so the psk clients guidance at the

1316
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,700
bottom of the page there says yes the

1317
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,920
working group is done with it the iesg

1318
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,260
looked at it approved it the ietf

1319
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,540
overall looked at it and approved it and

1320
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,640
now it's waiting for the fine people at

1321
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,900
the uh our PC production Center

1322
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,780
RPC uh to to publish it and it usually

1323
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,640
takes a month or two

1324
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,740
next

1325
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,920

1326
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,520

shirts line speed of the network people

1329
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,920
Miracle is the video conferencing

1330
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,920
systems every if you look at the agenda

1331
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,559
there are icons for every meeting and

1332
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:57,720
one of them is the video link uh one of

1333
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,099
them points to the data tracker page

1334
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:01,680
another points to the minutes and so on

1335
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,240
it's it's great uh often as Karen said

1336
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,819
this is usually the first meeting in

1337
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,859
whatever room we're in so there's often

1338
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:12,720
some bugs to shake out but we haven't

1339
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,740
had any

1340
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,079
backwards

1341
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,740
okay zulup it's our chat system

1342
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,280
uh unbiased because I helped influence

1343
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,500
it it's like slack but better

1344
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,540
um

1345
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,920
zulup.ietf.org if you have a data

1346
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,319
tracker login which are free and you

1347
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:32,760
should probably have one because of

1348
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,200
registration

1349
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,200
um you can see that they're very zulup

1350
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,319
is called them streams rather than rooms

1351
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:43,140
you can start topics inside streams and

1352
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,480
there is one for it's integrated with

1353

00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:56,880
Michelle often monitors that to answer

1358
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,619
questions about some of these

1359
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:00,780
how do I get around in this hotel

1360
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,700
things like that

1361
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,500
the first time we were here they

1362
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,900
actually had a

1363
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,700
scavenger hunt we had to find all the

1364
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,720
Looms

1365
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,300

these various links the Dow I'm not a

1368
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,819
big fan of the Dow it's too big and

1369
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:22,200
we're going to revise it and split it up

1370
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,240
into smaller more digestible pieces

1371
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,280
there's a glossary that talks about many

1372
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,160
meeting terms and so on uh various

1373
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,440
mailing lists and so on and then the

1374
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,940
One-Stop shop is the link at the bottom

1375
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,040
that lists all of the other links we're

1376
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,720
working on overhauling a lot of that

1377
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,859
stuff

1378
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,760

1379

1389

1391
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,579

to and I've been going to ITF meetings

1503
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,920
since 2000

1504
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,579

1508
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,480
direction

00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,160
um and yeah there's all those different

1510
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,599
places

1511
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:56,700
um if you're interested in a particular

1512
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,460
area you can look on the agenda and see

1513
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,920
if the area directors are holding office

1514
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,040
hours sometimes it's a a good place to

1515
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,540
just go in and chat with them find out

1516
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,980
about their working groups and maybe

1517
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,480
they can steer you in a particular

1518
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,180
direction

1519
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,940
keep an eye on the agenda we do in

1520
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,880
general it doesn't change but there are

1521
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,220
cancellations every once in a while and

1522
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,140
rarely there's a room change but you

1523
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,940
just want to keep an eye on the agenda

1524
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,740
to see if there are any changes to the

1525
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:29,000
groups that you're going to be attending

1526
