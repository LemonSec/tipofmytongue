thank you

2
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,980
thank you

3
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
foreign

4
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,920
okay welcome everyone to the Privacy

5
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,560
enhancement and assessments research

6
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,799
group

7
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,320
to our hf-115 meeting

8
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,479
as always there is the note Bell which

9
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,820
I'm sure you're familiar with by now and

10
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,259
we want to make everybody aware that the

11
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,420
session is being recorded

12
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,579
and we also just want to note that the

13
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,979
code of conduct that applies to the ietf

14
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,439
also holds in these meetings as well

15
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,340
a few extra notes for

16
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,159
um in person

17
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,960
attendees you are required to have your

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,060
mask on at all times in the room apart

19
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,420
from when you're actively speaking

20
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,460
for in-person attendees can you also

21
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,860
sign in through the meet Echo light

22
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,719
client because that replaces the blue

23
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,799
sheets

24
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,318
and uh in following what other groups

25
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,239
have been doing we'll be using a single

26
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,459
queue in meter Echo including for people

27
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,260
in the room so if you have a question

28
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,599
please add yourself into that queue via

29
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,340
the tool rather than going directly to

30
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,580
the mic

31
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,459
we have a very slightly modified agenda

32
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,739
from the one that was published uh on

33
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,660
the data tracker

34
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,000
um due to slight uncertainty of one of

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
the authors being able to attend for the

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,900
draft updates we will be going through

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,640
those updates at the start of the

38
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,680
meeting and then moving on to the remote

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,900
presentations

40
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,239
um I believe we have a minute taker so

41
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,560
thank you go Shabad for that

42
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,340
um before we get going is there anything

43
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,260
anybody would like to add or change

44
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,780
about the agenda

45
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,959
foreign

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,920
no if not then we will start by just

47
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,040
running over a quick update of the

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,660
drafts that we have going through the

49
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,720
research group at the moment

50
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,180
thanks yep

51
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,519
um it's a review of drafts that have

52
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,580
progressed from the research group we

53
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,519
have a pair of drafts on the history and

54
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,620
the generation of transient numeric

55
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,680
identifiers we believe they are in the

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,640
final throws of review and we're hopeful

57
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,440
we're One update away from getting those

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,700
published which will be very nice

59
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,900
they'll be the first documents to come

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,239
out of the research group

61
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,299
we also have the survey of worldwide

62
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,659
censorship techniques which passed its

63
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,760
um last call a couple of months ago and

64
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,819
has now been sent on to the Irish irtf

65
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,899
chair for further review

66
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,860
and we currently have two columns chair

67
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,780
apologizes for being slow at reviewing

68
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,120
that and hoping to get to it soon lovely

69
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,000
okay thank you yes I'm hands up from

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,620
Mallory yay thank you

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,659
um in terms of documents that are being

72
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,239
actively worked on we have two at the

73
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,000
moment we have the guidelines for

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,738
performing safe measurement on the

75
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,040
internet that had a fairly recent update

76
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
in I believe August of this year thank

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,199
you Mallory for that and we think that's

78
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,180
in relatively good shape

79
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,280
um we would love some more review of it

80
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,259
but we think we could consider moving

81
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,940
that forward

82
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,680
um in hopefully not too distant future

83
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,080
uh the other draft that is actively

84
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,419
being worked on at the moment is one on

85
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,600
IP address privacy consideration this is

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,780
a document that came out of the interim

87
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,139
we had on this topic year before last

88
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,000
um we have several authors contributing

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,419
to this at the moment and I'm hoping

90
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,699
that uh Brad is available to give us

91
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,580
a word or two on the status of that

92
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,000
foreign

93
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,280
of the draft uh last week and uh we

94
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,680
think we have some good content there

95
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,699
um although uh it is in uh bad need of

96
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,820
uh solid editorial pass uh to make sure

97
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,759
it is uh helpful for current topics that

98
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,759
folks are looking to use the draft for

99
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,759
um so uh really looking for folks to

100
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,600
take a review uh let us know

101
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,820
what uh applications of the draft that

102
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,320
uh would be where that could be helpful

103
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,960
and we'll be working on that editorial

104
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,638
pass between now and 116.

105
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,780
thank you and thank you for stepping in

106
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,220
at the last minute to update us on that

107
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,500
as well

108
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,660
Mallory I saw you sneak into the queue

109
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,340
and missed you if you want to go ahead

110
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,979
hi Mallory noodle CDT um I just wanted

111
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,479
to update really quick on the safe

112
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,880
measurement because I appreciate your um

113
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,520
faith that this document is good but

114
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,979
there are actually some important parts

115
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,020
of it that are Unwritten

116
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,419
um or in my view aren't aren't

117
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,060
elaborated enough so if there are folks

118
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,220
who work on this

119
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,819
um

120
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,520
I could also with maybe encouragement

121
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,039
from you all send messages to folks in

122
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,979
like PPM or elsewhere that might have

123
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,380
some overlap here just to

124
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,660
um get I think better text in those

125
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,340
places that would be much appreciated so

126
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,900
you can reach out to me directly or you

127
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,880
can go on the list

128
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,259
um and then the other update on that

129
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,340
draft is just that at the IAB workshop

130
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,840
on

131
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,139
um measurement in encrypted networks

132
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,600
um I I talked about this draft a bit so

133
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
others have seen it and it was sort of

134
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,900
in the context of like

135
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,880
it doesn't exactly speak to that that

136
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,600
workshop's mission or or um

137
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
um statement but I thought that what was

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,280
in that draft isn't really anywhere else

139
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,380
in terms of how you kind of do harm

140
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,800
reduction holistically rather than just

141
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,620
worrying about you know what

142
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,060
um what specifically you're you're

143
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,680
sending or what you're measuring I guess

144
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,380
of what sense so that was well received

145
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,120
in the sense that folks found it useful

146
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,039
and um so I wanted to feed that back to

147
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,900
the group as well thanks thank you very

148
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,020
much

149
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,300
and as always we're looking for new work

150
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,520
so please get in touch or write the list

151
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,380
if you think you have other items the

152
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,860
group would be interested in working on

153
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,280

154
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,819

170
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,039
present and so here we go

171
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,680
we um I put a tldr in the front here

172
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,459
because uh some folks uh in in the room

173
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,500
may be very familiar with privacy

174
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,540
preserving measurement especially the

175
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,120
activities at ietf or from other areas

176
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
and there's going to be some folks see

177
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,899
this presentation outside the room so I

178
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,100
thought I'd add that here but we can

179
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,140
move right along to our origin story for

180
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,000
clean insights

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,660
um which is that we started in 2017 with

182
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,519
a hackathon project at the Harvard

183
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,560
Berkeley Klein Center in association

184
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,940
with with MIT now it's hard to remember

185
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,519
this at this point but the the European

186
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,040
Union's gdpr had been adopted but was

187
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,560
not yet enforced at this time so we

188
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,120
didn't have a lot of insight into how

189
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
that was going to roll out and there was

190
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,779
interest

191
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,940
um across a set of communities who were

192
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,220
involved in civil society and internet

193
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,620
freedom and human rights in what was

194
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,480
going on with measurement and how

195
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,060
measurement intersected positively or

196
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,519
negatively with with

197
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,519
um privacy and human rights

198
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,040
Etc so I think you'll notice the date

199
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,680
down to the next item where uh internews

200
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,660
uh nonprofit who funded our work later

201
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,640
on clean insights you'll notice there's

202
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,500
a long time in there and I think that's

203
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,660
largely because it was a a period of

204
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,459
waiting to sort out what was going on

205
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,980
with these higher level uh privacy sort

206
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,820
of activities and around the 2000 time

207
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,940
frame both the funders for human rights

208
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,500
projects and the developers of those

209
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,320
projects were sort of stumbling over how

210
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,940
to address the problems that they were

211
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,360
finding

212
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
um so I think we started to ask a bunch

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,980
by asking a bunch of questions earlier

214
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,839
that then became even more present later

215
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,880
how can funders understand the impact of

216
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,440
the ideas they fund without putting

217
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,480
their users at risk how can companies

218
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,980
strike the right balance between

219
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,680
preserving privacy and driving their

220
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,260
development towards making it meet users

221
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,820
needs better

222
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,339
um you know is it really possible to do

223
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,920
measurement of digital interactions in a

224
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,600
safe and sustainable way especially in

225
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,860
the communities that we were interested

226
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,339
in and can the sort of privacy precepts

227
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,459
be upheld for even small

228
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,359
projects

229
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,920
so in 2020 mid-2020 there was a

230
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,200
symposium held uh interviews in

231
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,060
ourselves and several other parties

232
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,000
hosted developers who were in the open

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,279
open source human rights type

234
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,740
communities to look at and try to

235
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,220
understand their problems that they were

236
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,339
trying to deal with the demands of their

237
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,920
funders versus their deep interest in

238
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,500
their in their communities and I think

239
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,540
these sort of key points came out of

240
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,120
that these are this and I like I should

241
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,100
point out earlier that this is kind of a

242
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,100
different you know a vector of Interest

243
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,100
into internet into measurement than

244
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,399
other vectors might might be so you know

245
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,640
understanding the patterns of behavior

246
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,600
um in a way that doesn't alienate users

247
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,100
seeking up a platform for measurement

248
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,800
but one that doesn't harm in individuals

249
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,660
the there's an idea here that no

250
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,820
measurement isn't an option

251
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,480
um every we we need even the smallest

252
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,700
projects need to understand their impact

253
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,160
or problems with their software so it

254
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,260
isn't an option and a challenge is if

255
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,380
there isn't a safe alternative then

256
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,000
invasive options are easy to implement

257
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,160
and we're gonna we're gonna conundrum

258
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,380
about personal safety

259
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,300
um the the thought process back then

260
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,579
also was that if we could increment

261
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,079
forward on this that would be better

262
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,180
than waiting a long time for a large

263
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,560
Improvement

264
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,060
so

265
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,899
um uh the outcome of of that really is

266
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,240
on on trying to bring measurement in

267
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,160
line with respect for the user and the

268
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,160
idea was to focus on the right questions

269
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,260
and answering just on and getting just

270
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,560
enough data to answer those questions we

271
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,519
looked at

272
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,200
um aggregating on the source the

273
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,820
populations that we're interested are

274
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,700
very very largely on on mobile devices

275
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,579
that was certainly a consideration

276
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,320
um and that we wanted to have something

277
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,839
in the path between generator and

278
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,940
collector of information that would that

279
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,820
would discard this needlessly toxic

280
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,620
um personal personally identifying

281
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,440
information also we wanted to make the

282
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,260
idea of measurement a legible or

283
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,060
transparent is probably the wrong wrong

284
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,120
word at this point but uh but in part of

285
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,920
a usage experience that would engage the

286
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,620
user rather than alienate the user and

287
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,459
we looked at techniques for generalizing

288
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,760
data d d resolution what's the right

289
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,820
word for reducing identifiability I'd

290
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,560
like to point out here that also that

291
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,139
that the ideas like differential privacy

292
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:38,220
were

293
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,279
um were were quite solid in the in in

294
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,160
the literature starting really in 2006

295
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,760
but it wasn't until the 2015s and those

296
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,100
kind of dates when it really became sort

297
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,139
of at the Forefront to bring into this

298
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,000
kind of measurement so these kind of

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
ideas are still pretty new at the point

300
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,480
we started

301
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,680
so we started early we had a very basic

302
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,360
piece of technology that worked Back in

303
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,980
1970 uh eight sorry 2017 and you know

304
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,079
since then we've we've broadened it a

305
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,459
reasonable amount

306
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,680
um there are sdks for for both client

307
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,920
and and server available and um there's

308
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,220
an anonymizing proxy that sits between

309
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,660
uh the initial platform we worked with

310
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,540
called matomo which can be generalized

311
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,779
to be used with other analytics packages

312
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,380
um and maybe as importantly uh we

313
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,600
started looking at doing user research

314
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
to Define experiences that made

315
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,380
measurement uh collaborative

316
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,399
collaborative sort of experience and

317
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,980
more more obvious for the user and

318
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,339
started on implementations

319
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,180
uh this diagram here is meant to show uh

320
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,459
the the kinds of implementations of

321
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,079
clean insights that are possible the one

322
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,760
that's used in the dominant form today

323
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,459
is the direct connection where where

324
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:02,279
devices running in operative an

325
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,380
operative application for their

326
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,300
analytics can connect directly to a

327
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,560
proxy that then connects to the

328
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,019
analytics engine but there are also

329
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,660
Imagine scenarios necessary for us where

330
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,079
different kinds of uh front proxies get

331
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
involved to to assist the user where

332
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,000
there is either censorship uh

333
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,180
surveillance or additional privacy needs

334
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,600
requirement needs necessary domain

335
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,459
fronting is it can be used here is a

336
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,820
very specific term and then alt is a way

337
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,680
to think of other kinds of fronts where

338
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,139
maybe Tor is one of those and there are

339
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,360
some other tools being discussed at ietf

340
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,839
that can be used in this way

341
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,040
uh so when it comes to the actual

342
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,380
technology we Implement I'd like to

343
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,720
first point back to that idea that we're

344
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,459
feeling our we were feeling our way

345
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:54,120
initially here and and we're moving uh

346
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,760
from com you know no answer towards some

347
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,699
answer and iterating along the way so

348
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,860
what we wanted to start with was a way

349
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,399
to do what it was the general feeling of

350
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,060
normal analytics that is counting

351
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,699
um cross tab on some on some relatively

352
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,339
General metrics doing crash reports and

353
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,760
doing surveys and we felt that if if the

354
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,699
clean Insight solution didn't provide a

355
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,880
solution to those basic things that

356
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,399
people would demand or people would use

357
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,220
other existing side channels problematic

358
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,500
side channels to get what they needed so

359
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,600
we wanted enough a bare minimum of of of

360
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
um capability uh without having but not

361
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,860
solving the whole problem right away

362
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,100
in terms of improving anonymity we

363
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,540
looked at

364
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,240
um at batching reports from the client

365
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,180
to the to the server and that has a

366
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,000
number of effects positive on on usage

367
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,220
of networks in areas that are have very

368
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,380
deep network problems whether they're

369
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,480
generated by authorities or just

370
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,640
problematic networks and it also hides

371
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,099
time stamps of measured activities we

372
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,760
looked at ways to generalize and deres

373
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,199
information on the client talk about

374
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,880
that domain fronting I mentioned earlier

375
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
and we did recognize that ethos at the

376
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,339
scales that we're talking about the

377
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,640
number of users of applications Etc

378
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,339
um uh that that there was a tension

379
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,079
between respecting

380
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,480
consent and privacy and padding the

381
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,760
anonymity set so that's a sort of

382
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,559
detailed part of this but it was an

383
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,919
early criteria about remembering that we

384
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
have to we have to deal with small scale

385
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,840
projects

386
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,720
another thing we looked at was really

387
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,059
borrowing from law and maybe this is

388
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,640
kind of rethinking again from the

389
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,280
perspective of the user things about the

390
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,660
way measurement has been done

391
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,600
canonically and the way we thought our

392
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,780
our clientele our community wanted to um

393
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,299
to work on this so the first is the idea

394
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,240
of time-bound contracts that that

395
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,679
um you know the notion that things

396
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,179
you're bound to something that lasts

397
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,400
forever that's a challenge so we

398
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,140
introduced the idea of campaigns which

399
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,160
were ways to put a Time binding on when

400
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,260
measurements were going to be made the

401
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,200
second was consideration and this one

402
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,640
ties a little bit to the bottom one

403
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,440
which is called contracts of adhesion

404
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,980
the idea that people feel that they must

405
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,960
opt in because there's no alternative

406
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,640
there's disparate power between the

407
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,100
measuring entity and those measured and

408
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,160
and we wanted and there was often at

409
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,799
that point in time issues with refusing

410
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,960
consent meant you're just deprived of

411
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,059
the service complete lately so we wanted

412
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,220
to try to address these sorts of things

413
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,520
in in the way we did our work when we

414
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,080
created a toolkit and a set of best

415
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,900
practices for Developers so I think the

416
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,120
the main the main thing that we have

417
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,860
focused on early because it is part of

418
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,419
the user experience as well as the

419
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,720
technology is this idea of consent

420
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,620
understanding who's going to use your

421
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,539
app what the app is what they're going

422
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,419
to use it for and in what situations we

423
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,980
have a number of situations around the

424
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,179
globe that put really a fine point on

425
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:20,039
user situations and and and the

426
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,720
difficulty and challenges people have

427
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,460
using the internet especially the

428
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,559
communities that we serve and the

429
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,120
challenges that we get into when we're

430
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
creating Network traffic based on simply

431
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,919
trying to measure so we need to start as

432
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,539
we said earlier start considering about

433
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,539
specific questions narrowing the time

434
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,280
that we Implement that we measure

435
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,559
handling the data carefully and getting

436
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,419
rid of it once it's once it's reached

437
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,340
its destination and insight has been

438
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,400
gained working with developers at that

439
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,559
Symposium we've we started developing

440
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,840
sort of design patterns around how

441
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,320
consent can be handled and um as well as

442
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,240
the information needs that developers

443
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,520
and funders have

444
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,440
um we arrived at sort of principles

445
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,299
around consent and this is sort of the

446
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,780
user experience of of consent

447
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,480
um about making it easy to understand

448
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,539
what you're agreeing to that that thing

449
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,520
you're agreeing to is is pretty obvious

450
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,500
and there aren't hidden messages in

451
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,440
there and that that saying yes or no

452
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,900
doesn't mean giving up use of the

453
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,080
application and that the way we we

454
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,539
deliver consent is concentric array is

455
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,280
sort of centric around those who need it

456
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
so giving asking for it in the right way

457
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,539
using it in the right way

458
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,720
Etc

459
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,100
um here are a couple example models this

460
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,380
is the umbrella app and here's an

461
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,320
example where this app needs to look at

462
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,660
patterns of usage so it is in fact going

463
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,400
to measure different things and

464
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,679
connections between things so it wants

465
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,299
to make that obvious that that's going

466
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,640
to be what you're consenting to and then

467
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,500
that you're going to contribute for a

468
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,380
short period of time here 14 days is the

469
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,480
is the measurement period on the next

470
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,120
page we have another example which is

471
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,340
um uh talking about

472
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,260
um you know collecting metrics making it

473
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,539
feel like a like a focus group

474
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,460
um and again this is where only a

475
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,860
portion of the user base is actually

476
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,100
requested gets gets this request and

477
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,900
again A Time bound but a different way

478
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,360
to present the idea of consent to

479
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,719
measurement

480
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,919
um we we of course knew that the number

481
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,080
of studies we were we did undertake the

482
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,460
number of groups we worked with weren't

483
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,640
going to span the uh span the field for

484
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,559
what consent models might look like so

485
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,299
we came up with sort of guidelines and

486
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,240
best practices for for rolling your own

487
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,659
con consent and it I would hope that

488
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,580
some of these things feel awfully

489
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,820
logical and and uh right thinking I

490
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,400
guess you could say but in fact the ways

491
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,020
that these interact with the different

492
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,600
kinds of things that applications do and

493
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,400
the kinds of users using applications

494
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,640
quite a bit of thought is uh is required

495
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,880
here

496
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,260
um uh we have done a number of

497
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,480
implementations but we also went back

498
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,580
and looked at and worked with the teams

499
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,120
to look at how did our work work out for

500
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,539
you so we actually have impact reports

501
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,799
on uh on on some on some subset of the

502
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,900
applications we implemented

503
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,520
um clean insights for and these are

504
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,020
these are the apps here you'll notice

505
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,360
that they are uh privacy and security

506
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,820
related again that relates to our user

507
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,939
base

508
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,500
uh we're we're uh sort of going around

509
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,120
the world kind of in a lightweight way

510
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,240
promoting this idea again we since the

511
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,940
Guardian Project is fortunate to

512
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,440
um have a number of software libraries

513
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,600
that people that we've developed that

514
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,220
people use of ours we have a way to

515
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,620
we're talking to a lot of uh development

516
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,020
uh teams in the in the uh in the uh

517
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,020
internet Freedom space so so we do a

518
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,559
little bit drive on these messages

519
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,659
related to how to implement

520
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,900
um uh smooth and en metrics that people

521
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,200
can understand and want to be part of

522
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,720
um and and I think we have started at

523
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,760
the small scale working small creating a

524
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,220
new idea thinking about metrics in in a

525
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,840
new way and that's I think the key

526
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,500
insight for clean insights is that area

527
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,539
now on this uh last slide here I'd like

528
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,280
to talk a little bit about without go

529
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,320
getting into a lot of detail about the

530
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,240
commonalities and and differences

531
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,419
between uh clean insights which is again

532
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,460
a fairly you know now or five-year-old

533
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,780
project

534
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,700
um and what's going on in in privacy

535
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,000
preserving measurement at the ietf today

536
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,340
um our Affinity is that we did identify

537
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,220
that proxying was going to be necessary

538
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,860
to protect the identity of of the user

539
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,419
so

540
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:00,299
um we have in our proxy modestly

541
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,360
different functionality that that exists

542
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,460
um in in the work going on now or

543
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,740
tremendously different in that ours is

544
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,559
quite lightweight and we are we have a

545
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,900
client server balance between who is

546
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,820
implementing privacy

547
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,220
um we also like this idea of starting

548
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,539
with the questions in the in the

549
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,000
decisions rather than just dumping uh

550
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
all the data in raw format onto the onto

551
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
some server entity so this idea that

552
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,860
there's a collection phase that is

553
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,980
happens and in an analysis phase that

554
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,419
happens before

555
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,820
well eyes are on it and then the idea of

556
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,799
sort of neutralizing the toxicity and

557
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,960
data sets that are at rest once they do

558
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,240
get to the server importantly I think

559
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,960
what we sacrifice is is that we are

560
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,260
placing uh some trust in both the

561
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,200
collector and on the implementers in

562
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,299
terms of knowing what's toxic being

563
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:58,260
careful about what's toxic and and that

564
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,360
there's a best practices way to think

565
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,360
about that rather than a structured uh

566
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,460
protocol or tool set that that

567
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,320
implements those things in a hard and

568
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,500
fast Manner and lastly you know we do

569
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,080
our we do continue to be concerned about

570
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,980
the one-time visit the one-time use

571
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,780
those kinds of problems that occur that

572
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,620
really are problematic in in our area uh

573
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,039
uh okay lastly I I've just put up some

574
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,760
um some uh um links here that you can

575
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,620
look at I think the consent guide is a

576
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,539
really interesting thing to learn it's

577
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,360
one way to view clean and clean insights

578
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,220
is that in fact because Santa consent is

579
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,380
the key piece so

580
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,419
um and we also have uh the code out

581
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,039
there and the impact reports if you'd

582
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,960
like to look at those uh we're at the

583
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,820
Guardian Project and uh we really

584
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,580
appreciate our friends over at matomo uh

585
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,580
also looking at this problem from from a

586
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,860
server and analytics package standpoint

587
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,140
so I'd be really happy to take your

588
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,159
questions at this point

589
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,299
thank you David

590
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,059
um are there any questions

591
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,919
and thank you for inventing a new word

592
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,140
in the middle of your presentation we

593
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,600
have D resolutionizing to add to the

594
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,159
dictionary now

595
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,320
you know I also thought that consentful

596
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,559
might be plagued out as a uh as a new

597
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,480
word too but recently I've seen that

598
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,580
elsewhere so I guess we uh we didn't

599
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,380
make that one up

600
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,500
uh Stephen please go ahead yep hi David

601
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,820
Stephen Farrell

602
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,559
um yeah thanks for that that's the

603
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,240
interesting stuff I was just wondering

604
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,580
what how do you kind of treat something

605
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,080
analogous to the kind of right to be

606
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,640
forgotten or when people change their

607
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,919
minds about consent or is that something

608
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,179
that you've looked at as part of this

609
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,320
project

610
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,020
so I'm I'm gonna I think my straight

611
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,580
answer would be we haven't thought about

612
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,860
that but the other answer which I think

613
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,520
is maybe more in line or a way to figure

614
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,279
out uh or a way for that gives us a tool

615
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,679
is the idea of the campaign

616
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,039
um and we we do talk about opt out and

617
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,539
being respectful of people who don't

618
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,559
want to be part of of a campaign and

619
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,200
making it obvious uh um that you're

620
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,179
asking that and then and allowing them

621
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,520
to say no without you know decrementing

622
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,960
the function of the application totally

623
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,140
if they do say no so I I don't think we

624
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,679
have a um but right to be forgotten like

625
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,500
as if I said yes once but now I'm not

626
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,580
saying yes

627
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,559
um I'll take that back as a to-do that's

628
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:33,500
a great Point Stephen okay thanks yeah

629
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,440
uh Jonathan hoylan cloudflare yeah

630
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,340
um

631
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,760
given that realistically most consent

632
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,279
quote unquote we get these days is

633
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,659
actually just

634
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,640
uh you know that if you click I do not

635
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,620
consent it's going to be at least 400

636
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,159
clicks before you can see the website

637
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,500
um we shouldn't wouldn't it be better to

638
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,080
say actually let's push for

639
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,620
the to reject all tracking must be at

640
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,620
least one fewer clicks than accepting

641
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,299
and you know then you'd find all these

642
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,860
websites where I'd like reject tools the

643
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,480
big red button like yeah everyone wants

644
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,580
that and oh yeah if I really like this

645
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,760
website and I want them to track me

646
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,260
then somebody could in theory do 400

647
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,779
clicks to say yeah really really trap me

648
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,919
I'll be up for that

649
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,559
I uh I'm smiling about that that's a

650
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,360
that's a great point I think this idea

651
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,580
of you know we have some on the in the

652
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,919
sort of group that that represents this

653
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,880
who we think that that consent has been

654
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,679
diluted so badly by the current regime

655
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,799
that it's impossible basically that for

656
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,059
the reasons that sort of Steven

657
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,760
mentioned for the reason that

658
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,700
um of the contract of adhesion I idea

659
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,400
that the gdpr was initially our friend

660
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,080
and now might have been our enemy you

661
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,820
know there there's a lot of a lot of

662
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,640
issues with with the fact that

663
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,340
um the the level of forcing you to give

664
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,740
consent is is can be either hardcore or

665
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,840
subtle but eventually

666
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,659
um so so I I don't think we know how to

667
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,659
answer that question at the at a macro

668
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,940
level what we've tried to do is sort of

669
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,880
put tools in place that allow people who

670
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,400
and and by the way we in in the Mobile

671
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,460
area looking awful lot at small scale

672
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,600
applications

673
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,760
um you know we we have an app out of

674
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,860
Guardian Project called Orbot you know

675
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,720
several million users but most

676
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,299
everything else is is below that and the

677
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:31,679
people who

678
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,360
um are interested in that are also in a

679
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,100
subset so this is not an internet scale

680
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,039
thing and and we're looking at ways

681
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,799
again starting small to figure out how

682
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,159
to to try to make consent be real again

683
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,679
I'm afraid I don't have a good overall

684
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,659
answer for you Jonathan on that

685
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:52,260
all right thank you yeah

686
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,539
hi Conrad cobrook

687
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,279
um are there any plans to reduce the

688
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,779
Trust on The Collector using

689
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,580
cryptography I understand there are a

690
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,320
couple of projects that are working on

691
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,320
protocols uh that try to do that is

692
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,779
there anything on the agenda for

693
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,360
um for your project

694
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,520
I would say not yet but part of the

695
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,260
reason I I did attend yesterday's

696
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,940
presentation on privacy preserving

697
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,320
measurement and had been interested in

698
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,539
it since the it's come up here is that

699
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:21,360
we do have a number of alternatives for

700
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,520
increasing

701
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,220
um uh uh the privacy of what we're doing

702
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,880
via VIA encryption for sure so

703
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,899
um uh the the oblivious HTTP aspect is

704
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,399
one thing

705
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:37,860
um but there there are also a number of

706
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,860
of items possible

707
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,740
um by implementing more

708
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,380
um uh you know algorithmic privacy

709
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,600
measures on the client as well as on the

710
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,340
intermediary

711
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,380
um the so the proxy the clean insights

712
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,559
proxy so yeah I but I can't I'm not

713
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,179
willing to speak I don't think I can

714
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,179
adequately speak to things directly on

715
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,580
on the item or on the list

716
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,399
um we're just mapping and looking at and

717
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,799
making sure our the architecture can can

718
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,799
fit those things as they come along

719
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,779
differential privacy ideas were thought

720
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:16,620
of early and we have sort of in-spirit

721
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,460
versions of that now done on the uh as

722
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,679
part of the toolkit in the client but

723
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,340
you know there is DP is uh has a very

724
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,200
specific meaning and so I'm I hesitate

725
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,460
to use that term

726
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,020
um in a generic way I think that's a

727
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,039
specific thing that we don't have

728
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,320
implemented yet

729
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,820
okay thank you

730
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,260
okay

731
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,360
thank you David for the presentation and

732
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,000
thanks for all questions

733
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,360
uh move on to the next presentation now

734
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,940
Sophia could you uh please try and show

735
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,740
your slides

736
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,320
yes I think I requested

737
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,140
okay okay

738
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,700
they are up a little

739
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,460
okay uh hi everybody my name is Sofia

740
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,260
selly and I'm joined today with Daniel

741
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,640
Jones

742
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,320
um and today we're going to be talking

743
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,320
about uh paper we publish

744
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,659
some weeks ago about finding certain

745
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,460
practically exploitable cryptographic

746
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,559
vulnerabilities in Matrix you can find

747
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,720
the paper online and this is a joint

748
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,520
work with Martin algorithm Benjamin

749
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,080
Dowling

750
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,440
so first a little bit of context

751
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,059
um we started looking at Matrix because

752
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,580
we wanted uh to actually do a formal

753
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,620
analysis and a formal model of Matrix

754
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,299
and in the process of looking at the

755
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,520
specification and implementation we

756
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,960
found several practical vulnerabilities

757
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,620
which turned into this paper but just to

758
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,840
give a little bit of context into the

759
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,580
people in the room that don't know about

760
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,620
it a matrix is a standard for security

761
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,260
centralized real-time messaging and

762
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,779
basically aims to do what sntp has been

763
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,399
doing for email

764
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,200
um one of the biggest thing to think

765
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,059
about in Matrix is that it aims to do

766
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,860
secure communication in the face of

767
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,720
untrusted service which they call the

768
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,039
Home Server in a Federated way

769
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,299
and it's very important to think about

770
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,399
this untrusted server because this will

771
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,460
be our thread model when looking at all

772
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,820
of these attacks

773
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,039
and as I said Matrix uses on trusted

774
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,779
server and because these servers are

775
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,820
untrusted they also allow end-to-end

776
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,640
encryption by default on their channels

777
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,840
um because they are in the face of

778
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,200
untrusted service

779
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,299
one of the flagships clients of Matrix

780
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,220
which people are most often familiar

781
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,080
which is the element client which is the

782
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,480
people how they actually approach into

783
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,760
Matrix through the element client but

784
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,740
the protocol itself is called Matrix and

785
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,059
has been implemented in other

786
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,460
applications and clients besides the

787
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,380
element one

788
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,120
so why should we care where should we

789
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,860
care about these vulnerabilities and in

790
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,019
general about doing a formal analysis of

791
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,480
this protocol is because Matrix and its

792
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,159
Flagship client which is element is

793
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,380
widely used the website of element for

794
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,200
example reports that they have over 60

795
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,019
million users and the French and the

796
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:05,640
German government are currently using

797
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,440
for internal Communications and other

798
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,940
Communications and also Mozilla and kdae

799
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,520
um in 2019 announced plans to actually

800
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,659
use it

801
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,980
so it's a widely used protocol

802
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,339
uh as I said this is a secure messenger

803
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,980
which means that they have certain or

804
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,440
claim to try to have certain uh

805
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,418
end-to-end encryption properties such as

806
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,219
confidentiality and equity and

807
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,379
authentication and they also claim to

808
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:36,480
provide certain certain form of forward

809
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,339
secrecy which I think they call partial

810
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,440
forward secrecy post compromise security

811
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,199
and a form of vulnerability in our

812
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,179
research we didn't look at these last

813
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,339
three properties but rather we just

814
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,080
focused onto the core properties of

815
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,399
confidentiality integrity and

816
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,859
authentication so it remains as future

817
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,540
work that we are doing into actually

818
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,500
looking at the more specific properties

819
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,420
okay just to give you a little bit of an

820
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,300
overview of how the how cryptography is

821
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,520
used um in Matrix

822
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,680
so basically Matrix you have several

823
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,960
parties you have a user uh which you

824
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,140
often represent a client and this user

825
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,839
has many devices for example a laptop a

826
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,180
phone or something like that and all of

827
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,220
them uh communicate with each other

828
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,560
through the relying of messages via the

829
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,420
home service it's on trusted Home Server

830
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,460
that I already talked about and this

831
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,020
Home Server also used to store

832
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,579
communication history and account

833
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,859
information of the user and furthermore

834
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,680
is also used to provide a device

835
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,900
identifier for the several devices that

836
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,359
a user holds

837
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,700
in order to achieve authentication they

838
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,740
use a certain crypto cryptographic

839
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,900
identity there's a master cryptographic

840
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,060
identity that is called the master BK

841
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,240
which is the one that is used to provide

842
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,980
authentication for the devices that a

843
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,619
user holds and also to co-sign

844
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,420
um the devices that all the users hold

845
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,339
so you can use all of these identities

846
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,339
to for example if your Alice also verify

847
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:05,040
uh the cryptographic identities of the

848
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,400
devices that both holds for example

849
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,220
and in turn each device also has its own

850
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,560
cryptographic identity so you have first

851
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,900
uh user identity and also pass device

852
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,420
identity and that one is the one that is

853
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,400
usually used to establish the key

854
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
establishment and encryption channels

855
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,780
that are going to be used by matrix

856
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,760
um those channels are called a megalum

857
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,680
those are the cryptographic protocols

858
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,240
that I use and I'm going to Define them

859
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,859
a little bit late

860
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:34,079
so you want to see how the process of

861
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,880
actual verification work is that you

862
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,680
have this master public Keys which in

863
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,480
turn sign

864
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,520
um self-signing key and also a user

865
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,619
signing key a sub signing key is the one

866
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,200
that is going to be used to verify the

867
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,660
pad device key and a user key is going

868
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,820
to be the one to verify that verifies

869
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,280
the list of devices of the other users

870
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,800
so there's this complex critical in

871
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,720
which the different Keys may cross

872
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,079
verify each other

873
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,900
okay as I said uh they use om and

874
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,760
megalum as the underlying cryptographic

875
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,040
mechanism so let's explain first what's

876
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,920
his own home is basically a way to

877
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,160
establish a secure Channel between two

878
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,380
pairs so for example one device with one

879
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,480
another and the reason that they do this

880
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,280
is so that they establish a secure

881
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,680
channel in which they can share the key

882
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,359
material that is going to be used to

883
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:26,099
encrypt it messages during the group

884
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,420
chat

885
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,280
um what is used on this is that they use

886
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,040
a modified 3dh protocol from the Cigna

887
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,960
protocol and also the double ratchet

888
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,119
algorithm from the signal protocol they

889
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,280
use an old version of 3dh because right

890
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,320
now signal uses another version which is

891
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,420
called x3dh and they use the old version

892
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,880
which is 3dh claiming to have certain

893
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,579
deniability properties

894
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,680
and as I said they also have the channel

895
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,300
which is called megalon which is

896
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,160
basically the group channel in which

897
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,260
once you have established an OM Channel

898
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,420
a Payless Channel with each one of the

899
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,460
devices then you use this pair with

900
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,920
channels to share uh the group share key

901
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,260
information that is going to be used to

902
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,820
encrypt one each one of the messages

903
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,920
that you send through the group and

904
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,599
effectively this is similar to how

905
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,000
signal users send their keys

906
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,280
um megalom also has some ratcheting

907
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,260
properties that are very different

908
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,660
um not very different but different to

909
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,280
how signal does the double ratchet

910
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,800
algorithm and the mega loan properties

911
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,900
have not been formally analyzed but the

912
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,760
community so it remains to be seen what

913
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,180
kind of this established properties

914
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,660
megalum actually has

915
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,980
and here just a little bit of diagrams

916
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,960
in case you want to look a little bit

917
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,720
more okay so let's go to the meat of the

918
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,240
talking itself which are the attacks and

919
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,920
in this case I'm going to be studying

920
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,720
Define the first attack and then then

921
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,980
we'll be

922
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,500
um explaining the rest of the attacks so

923
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,240
the first attack we have found we

924
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,400
actually call it the attack in which the

925
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,560
home server has control of the users and

926
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,720
the list of the devices so why this

927
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,000
happens is because you have as part of a

928
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,400
group chat you don't only send user

929
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,020
messages but you also send group

930
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,420
membership messages so for example that

931
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,640
a user wants to join or a user wants to

932
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,099
be removed why user wants to be modified

933
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,440
somewhere but the problem is that

934
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,480
neither of any of these group membership

935
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,300
messages are encrypted uh check for

936
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,980
integrity no cryptographically

937
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,200
authenticated which means that a

938
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,540
malicious Home Server can indeed inject

939
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,359
any user into the room and those fours

940
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,000
are injected users will be able to

941
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,880
decrypt any uh future messages that are

942
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,280
sent in the channel

943
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,380
why they think that this actually this

944
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,180
attack happens in practice because we

945
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,800
think there was an assumption from the

946
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,900
protocol designers but this is just a

947
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,180
speculation we think that there was an

948
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,500
assumption that the only thing that

949
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,560
needs to be protected is uh the user

950
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,359
messages themselves but not this room

951
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,099
membership Pages

952
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,720
um so maybe there was this assumption

953
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,180
and in general because sometimes there's

954
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,920
practical issues when actually trying to

955
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,780
implement and actually be encrypting and

956
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,760
authenticated these other messages are

957
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,160
not using messages

958
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,119
a second type of this attack is in which

959
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,099
um on the country instead of adding a

960
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,200
new user the Home Server you're adding a

961
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,300
new user what happens is that the home

962
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,700
server has a new device to your list of

963
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,680
devices so I already said at the

964
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,480
beginning is that you use cryptographic

965
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,119
identities to verify each one of the

966
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,920
devices that you own so for example you

967
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,839
verify that indeed you're on the phone

968
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,540
and need you on the laptop but this

969
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,700
cryptographic verification is separate

970
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,500
from the list of the devices that the

971
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,180
Home Server maintains this list of

972
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,859
devices that the Home Server maintains

973
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:39,900
is not authenticated it's not encrypted

974
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,460
it's just a list of the Home Server

975
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,500
maintains so therefore the Home Server

976
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,780
can also inject a new device into this

977
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,420
list and again this device will be able

978
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,700
to decrypt any future messages that are

979
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,920
sent through the room

980
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,200
why we Hindi this happened for the same

981
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,940
reason that we already said in the fast

982
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,460
attack and how we actually go on solve

983
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,859
these attacks um is probably by the way

984
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,140
that we will have to use a list that is

985
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,720
cryptographically authenticated and it's

986
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,060
also properly checked and it's not just

987
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,980
a plaintiffs list that Home Server

988
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,380
controls and in fact indeed we already

989
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,540
have such a list because of the crew

990
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,460
signing uh procedure that I was just

991
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,680
describing is it doing practical right

992
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,660
now that for users probably that will be

993
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,000
doing practical to have like a list of

994
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
devices that the user has to

995
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,200
individually verify but for now that's

996
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,420
kind of the best that we have

997
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,480
okay and now then we'll explain the rest

998
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,140
of the attacks

999
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,020
I think you admitted then

1000
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,560
okay we can't hear you Dan do you want

1001
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,299
to just uh try resetting your audio

1002
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,480
we can see you but we can't hear you

1003
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,680
foreign

1004
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,260
I think we still can't hear you so

1005
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:22,320
Dan do you want me to continue while

1006
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,660
you're trying to oh there you go we got

1007
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,690
it

1008
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,500
[Music]

1009
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,760
ready uh yes yes

1010
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,660
sorry about that

1011
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,640
um yeah so the next few attacks um we're

1012
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,200
going to go through they vary a little

1013
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,940
bit in the extent to which they are kind

1014
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,619
of attacks against the protocol design

1015
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:42,900
or maybe the implementation so like if

1016
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,119
we muddle those up sorry

1017
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,480
um but uh so this first attack

1018
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,460
um when two parties want to ensure that

1019
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,900
connection hasn't been tampered with

1020
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,119
they probably want to check for like

1021
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,500
um is there a Mallory in the middle

1022
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,359
attack and they can do this

1023
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,000
um by doing out of band authentication

1024
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,440
um and Matrix provides like a couple of

1025
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,960
protocols to do this but um the one

1026
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,220
we're going to talk about now is the

1027
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,619
short authentication string protocol

1028
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:10,140
which kind of very briefly the idea of

1029
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,420
it is that um these two parties are

1030
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,940
going to do a key exchange to kind of

1031
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,040
generate some kind of shared secret and

1032
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,060
then they're going to compare that

1033
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,160
shared secret out of band and some of

1034
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,780
the snidiness of this protocol is you

1035
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,000
get kind of um they use short strings

1036
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,339
for emojis to do the comparison

1037
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:29,160
and providing they do match

1038
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,319
um they're then going to send their real

1039
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,780
like correct cryptographic identities to

1040
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,760
each other over a secure channel that

1041
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,680
they've construct constructed using the

1042
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,420
shared secret

1043
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,980
um and this works really well in Matrix

1044
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,260
but there's our attack targets that

1045
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,500
final final stage where they've got a

1046
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,420
nice secure channel that the Home Server

1047
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,880
can track devices into sharing an

1048
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,400
identity that the Home Server controls

1049
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,200
and what could you go to the next slide

1050
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,339
up next

1051
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:57,960
thanks

1052
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,700
um so like how does the Home Server do

1053
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,440
this trick

1054
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,240
um well first I'm going to explain this

1055
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,800
kind of two types of verification and

1056
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,560
Matrix so sometimes you want to verify

1057
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,940
to

1058
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,640
the the identity of another user so two

1059
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,960
users are going to do some out of

1060
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,880
balance verification together but

1061
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,200
sometimes

1062
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,180
um two of your own devices need to also

1063
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,579
do a verification

1064
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,560
um and they use the same protocol for

1065
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,839
this and for step three of that protocol

1066
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:26,460
where they exchange their cryptographic

1067
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,960
identities

1068
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,920
um

1069
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,160
they they send a key identifier

1070
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,380
um and they use the same field for both

1071
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,839
of these types of verifications

1072
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,339
um so when you're verifying other users

1073
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:41,880
you send a a fingerprint of your master

1074
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,339
cross signing key so it's that mpk field

1075
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,680
but when you're when you're verifying

1076
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,079
devices you instead use the device

1077
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:51,119
identifier and the problem with that is

1078
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,740
that that is actually controlled by the

1079
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,880
Home Server

1080
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,099
oh so if you go to the next

1081
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,540
slide please

1082
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,099
thanks

1083
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:00,420
um so then

1084
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,460
well Home Server can do this trick where

1085
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,680
it generates its own kind of Master

1086
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,839
cross signing key and and kind of

1087
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:10,200
cryptographic identity for a user and a

1088
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,760
signs of its fingerprint as the device

1089
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,339
identifier and then at some point when

1090
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,260
two devices

1091
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:16,980
um

1092
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,839
perform this out of band verification

1093
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:22,260
they're going to send a message and

1094
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,119
the device sending the message will send

1095
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,339
a key identifier they think it's a

1096
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,579
device device identifier but the device

1097
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,579
that receives it will interpret it as a

1098
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,500
master cross signing key fingerprint and

1099
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,119
this means they'll sign that user

1100
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,640
identity and you've kind of like tricked

1101
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,220
tricked them into trusting a user

1102
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,480
identity that's actually controlled by

1103
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,579
the Home Server at that point you can do

1104
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,200
kind of like an active mother in the

1105
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,720
middle attack from then onwards

1106
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,500
um next slide please thanks

1107
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,420
um so what causes attack well it was

1108
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,220
effectively just like a lack of domain

1109
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,640
separation between these key identifiers

1110
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,280
and the device identifiers using them in

1111
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,819
the same place

1112
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,599
um and in general I think it would be

1113
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,220
really great to like in the future just

1114
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,200
to avoid using server-controlled inputs

1115
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,460
and these kinds of other band

1116
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,160
verification protocols because it just

1117
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,920
helps with kind of cleanliness

1118
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,140
um oh and the next slide please thanks

1119
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,300
oh cool so for the next attack we're

1120
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,800
going to talk about we've called it the

1121
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,380
semi-trusted impersonation attack

1122
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,680
um and the idea of it is um when a user

1123
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,420
adds a new device they'd like that

1124
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,800
device to be able to decrypt messages

1125
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,740
previously sent to that user and there's

1126
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,940
this thing called the key request

1127
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,940
protocol that Matrix um kind of provides

1128
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,099
to do that and here we can see on this

1129
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:42,180
slide

1130
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,920
um Alice's first device on the left

1131
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,140
receives a message it can't decrypt so

1132
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,819
it sends out another message asking for

1133
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:49,740
the decryption key

1134
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,540
Alice the second device sees this

1135
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,040
request and it checks a couple of things

1136
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,520
it goes well um is a requesting device a

1137
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,460
verified device from the same user as me

1138
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,380
or have I already sent this kind of

1139
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,599
decryption key before and if it passes

1140
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,359
those checks they'll encrypt using an OM

1141
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:09,300
Channel a forwarded room key message is

1142
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,520
what it's called and they'll send the

1143
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,800
decryption key to Alice's first device

1144
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,200
and as part of that message they'll um

1145
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,060
Vellum include the

1146
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,859
um the identifier of the device that

1147
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:25,800
kind of the claimed owner of that key

1148
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,660
um and that for that reason it's really

1149
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,020
important that um you check when you're

1150
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,940
on the receiving side do I trust this

1151
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,760
device that I sent it to me and um this

1152
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,859
is where the checks were missing

1153
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:39,420
and so if you move to the next slide

1154
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,440
please

1155
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,579
thanks

1156
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:43,380
um so what the the attack it can do what

1157
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,359
a Home Server can do is they can create

1158
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,579
their own device they can generate their

1159
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:49,680
own room session they're in megalom

1160
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,839
session and they can just forcibly send

1161
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,180
a forwarded room key message

1162
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,700
to Alice's device pretending to be say

1163
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,560
Bob's device

1164
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,740
um and Alice's device would just kind of

1165
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,900
accept it so this was this kind of

1166
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,660
attack worked in practice but the

1167
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,819
um it is a little bit weak because

1168
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,400
all keys that arrive via these folded

1169
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,960
room key messages

1170
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,700
um will be

1171
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,220
flagged as like kind of semi-trusted and

1172
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,079
so you can impersonate on the mega ohm

1173
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:20,880
Channel but only in a way that's kind of

1174
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,020
like

1175
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,540
um flagged in the user interface of

1176
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,599
access to the next societies thanks

1177
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,040
um so what caused this well it was it

1178
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,599
was effectively just an implementation

1179
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:31,740
mistake

1180
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,079
um but as a general kind of like well

1181
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,579
this is my this is my reading of the

1182
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,099
situation the key request protocol

1183
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:40,380
um was a little bit underspecified in

1184
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,619
that it didn't talk too strongly about

1185
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:44,819
um

1186
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,980
like why

1187
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,079
um what to do on the receiving side and

1188
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,480
similarly what to trust like it wasn't

1189
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,460
it doesn't it kind of leaves that up to

1190
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,920
the implementer like how how should you

1191
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,300
when should you trust these forwarded

1192
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,000
room key messages when shouldn't you

1193
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,240
um so I think like a more prescriptive

1194
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,020
specification would have would have

1195
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,420
helped there I'll call next next slide

1196
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,920
please thanks

1197
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,420
um so now for the next attack we're

1198
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,800
going to talk about

1199
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,960
um a kind of a slight upgrade to this so

1200
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,599
when you have a mega ohm session set up

1201
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,420
um you initialize like a mega ohm

1202
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,540
I'm an imbo an outbound session an

1203
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,040
inbound session and a signature that

1204
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,260
kind of links them together

1205
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,420
um and you send these over like the old

1206
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,060
channels as before but

1207
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:30,720
um

1208
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,400
knowing that we can kind of do the

1209
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,440
semi-trusted impersonation attack over

1210
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,140
Mega ohm the question is can we use this

1211
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,300
kind of

1212
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,460
um can we if we can send these messages

1213
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,040
these session setup messages over Mega

1214
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,720
ohm instead we can kind of upgrade our

1215
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,000
impersonation attack to one that isn't

1216
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,220
kind of tagged as a forwarded key and

1217
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,020
that's what our attack tries to do also

1218
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,660
if you go to the next slide please

1219
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,839
you can see here what we try to do is we

1220
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,300
start off the Home Server is trying to

1221
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,780
impersonate Bob to Alice

1222
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,940
um and it first starts by doing the

1223
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,280
semi-trust impersonation attack and at

1224
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,599
this point

1225
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,339
um they can send the adversary can send

1226
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,980
medical messages that verify as being

1227
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,859
from Bob's device they can then generate

1228
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,440
a second Mega ohm session we've tagged

1229
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,319
this G star and they send it using a

1230
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,060
normal session setup message so it's not

1231
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,520
a folded room key but they do it over

1232
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,380
Mega ohm and this is kind of where the

1233
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,180
the protocol confusion and where the

1234
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,880
main implementation mistake was

1235
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,040
um and by sending it over Mega ohm it

1236
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,660
kind of passes all the checks that say

1237
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,119
this is a verified

1238
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,260
um

1239
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,560
this is a like a verified message from

1240
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,859
Bob's device over Mega ohm and from this

1241
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:48,660
point onwards it kind of gets tagged as

1242
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,119
a session and you can use it

1243
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,920
um but it's not tagged as like a

1244
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,079
forwarded one or anything like that

1245
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:57,300
um so it kind of get a slight upgrade oh

1246
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,619
cool uh on to the next slide please

1247
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,480
thanks

1248
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,339
um so then for the next attack and the

1249
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:03,660
final one we're going to be doing in

1250
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,460
this presentation

1251
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,040
um is the kind of a confidential

1252
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,380
confidentiality break that extends the

1253
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,140
the issues we just talked about

1254
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,480
um by by looking at two new subprosicles

1255
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,540
so the mega ohm key backups protocol

1256
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,480
allows inbound Mega ohm sessions so kind

1257
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,579
of like the decryption keys to be backed

1258
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:26,220
up on home servers and then

1259
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,900
um they're encrypted on home surface

1260
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,520
using a recovery key that's kind of

1261
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,579
shared between the user's devices

1262
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:34,619
um the second sub protocol we're going

1263
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:36,480
to talk about and use is to Secure

1264
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,059
Storage and secret sharing protocol

1265
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:41,640
which allows users to backup account

1266
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,680
level secrets and they're supposed to

1267
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,480
share them between their devices so this

1268
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,359
is things like cross signing Keys

1269
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:50,460
um and actually the recovery key that

1270
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,500
Mega ohm

1271
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,660
used for Mega ohm key backups that gets

1272
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,819
synchronized using the Secure Storage

1273
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:59,819
and secret sharing protocol

1274
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:03,480
um so in this attack what we do is we

1275
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,160
utilize that protocol confusion and

1276
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,900
semi-trust impersonation attack from

1277
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,480
before but we impersonate a trusted

1278
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,760
device and use the secret sharing

1279
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,200
functionality

1280
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,920
to force the target device into using a

1281
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,800
mega ohm key backup that the recovery

1282
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,180
key

1283
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,280
I mean sorry uh using a mega home key

1284
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,720
backup

1285
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,480
and use the recovery key for them that

1286
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,559
is actually under the Home Service

1287
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,020
control so we kind of impersonate a

1288
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,880
trusted device and send your recovery

1289
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,839
key and then what happens is the um the

1290
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,240
target device will then start uploading

1291
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,800
all of the decryption keys that has

1292
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,520
encrypted on the Home Server but with a

1293
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,980
um encrypted with a key that's under the

1294
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,380
Home Service control and at that point

1295
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,980
you can kind of decrypt these

1296
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,059
decrypt all the messages that this

1297
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:55,980
target device has access to

1298
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,720
oh cool

1299
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,460
um and then if you skip forward again

1300
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,400
sorry I'm just gonna thanks yeah so what

1301
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,540
caused this

1302
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,160
um well again it was it was an

1303
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,200
implementation mistake and the main one

1304
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,720
was this protocol confusion

1305
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,300
um but the there are ways this could

1306
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,220
have been kind of maybe avoided a little

1307
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,900
bit or discouraged by the specification

1308
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,480
because it um there's a they push quite

1309
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,240
a bit for a kind of like plugable and

1310
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,040
replaceable encryption algorithms which

1311
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,260
means that

1312
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,839
um kind of that's reflected in the code

1313
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,359
architecture but um different algorithms

1314
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:32,040
have different security properties that

1315
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,780
check like change how they can be used

1316
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,700
security so maybe a more prescriptive

1317
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,440
and less flexible specification might

1318
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,260
have helped avoid this kind of like um

1319
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,940
this kind of code issue but yes

1320
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,099
definitely an implementation problem oh

1321
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:47,480
thanks Sofia

1322
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:51,780
okay

1323
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,099
um so just a little bit to give you a

1324
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:54,839
little bit of a conclusion so what's the

1325
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,099
lesson learns that we learned after

1326
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,359
looking at the role of these

1327
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,460
vulnerabilities first and foremost that

1328
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,020
they are practically exploitable we even

1329
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,119
have a private concept that indeed they

1330
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,579
can be practically exploitable we don't

1331
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,140
know how much they are exploitable in

1332
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,000
the world in the wild

1333
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,200
um some of them have been fixed by

1334
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,300
Dimitri specifications some of them will

1335
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,920
be fixed in the future and some of them

1336
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,839
might not be fixed

1337
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,119
um the reason why Matrix did all of this

1338
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:19,559
protocol is because it's a really

1339
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,599
complex scene to do properly secure

1340
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,880
messaging group messaging protocol as we

1341
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,800
have experience already in the iitf with

1342
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,819
MLS

1343
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:29,000
um it's not an easy task

1344
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,800
and then the other easy test on actually

1345
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,660
thinking about group messaging is to

1346
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,160
actually think what kind of properties

1347
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,800
you should have and that at least from

1348
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,599
the specification or Matrix sometimes

1349
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,760
it's not unclear what kind of a specific

1350
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,920
properties they aim to provide

1351
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,260
so that's what is the conclusion of this

1352
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,240
that we need actually a formal model and

1353
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,040
Analysis of thinking of this protocol

1354
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,440
and perhaps also understanding and

1355
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,780
taking inspiration from protocols as TLS

1356
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,819
on mls in which there was a

1357
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:58,619
collaboration between the academic and

1358
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:00,960
vanity standardization body form of

1359
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,760
verification Community to actually

1360
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,099
provide protocols that actually had a

1361
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,859
good threat adversity model in mind and

1362
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:09,540
also the specific properties that they

1363
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,280
wanted to provide and a formal proof

1364
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,140
that indeed to their Chief said uh

1365
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,480
property so we probably we want to have

1366
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,660
a correct uh group secure messaging

1367
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,760
protocol that is interoperable as well

1368
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,980
then we actually need to do the work of

1369
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,720
actually sitting down with several

1370
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,280
people from several communities to

1371
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,099
provide a safe critical with that I will

1372
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:31,559
just skip these other slides and thank

1373
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,980
you very much

1374
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,440
thank you thank you both for um an

1375
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,240
excellent and very sobering presentation

1376
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,920
I think you have certainly answered the

1377
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,900
question secure group messaging what

1378
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,819
could possibly go wrong if we didn't

1379
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:47,579
already know the answer

1380
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:48,780
um thank you for your teamwork on the

1381
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,280
presentation as well

1382
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,599
um and I'm hoping we have some questions

1383
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:04,040
okay uh we do uh Stephen you're up first

1384
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,420
Hey Stephen Farrell really good work

1385
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,460
thanks for doing it and Reporting out uh

1386
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,319
I I just had a question did you have a

1387
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:14,940
um or did you spend any time looking at

1388
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,579
the Federation between home servers and

1389
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:18,420
uh

1390
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,859
are there any issues there that you

1391
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:23,900
found or that might be interesting

1392
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,900
um

1393
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,280
what happened

1394
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,859
um we kind of modeled it completely as

1395
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:34,020
um kind of all the home servers are a

1396
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,460
single entity almost like a single

1397
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,319
untrusted entity

1398
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:38,700
um but it'd probably be good to do that

1399
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,119
I think there is a cool paper that looks

1400
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:44,040
at the synchronization algorithm the the

1401
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,500
state sync algorithm but I can't

1402
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,160
remember the name of it

1403
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,660
sure if you could if you could think of

1404
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,980
it and put it in the chat or mail it'd

1405
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,000
be great later thanks

1406
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,200
yeah uh Rafa Robert

1407
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,300
um yeah so my question is the same vein

1408
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,400
as stefans do you plan a sequel

1409
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,980
you when I got done well I think we will

1410
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,859
be the same so you got it thank you um

1411
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:19,859
yeah I think our plan is to we're

1412
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:21,720
working on some form of model modeling

1413
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,059
and those kinds of things so

1414
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:25,380
um that would probably be like the

1415
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,800
natural follow-up is to try and um show

1416
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,140
that now that Matrix have fixed like the

1417
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,880
vast majority of these issues and they

1418
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,140
did it really fast and they were super

1419
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,760
responsive

1420
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,480
um

1421
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,280
yeah just trying to show that now you

1422
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,780
know we can get to a place where we

1423
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,300
believe it's nice and secure

1424
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,940
some other words that we have also been

1425
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,400
thinking is uh to actually understand

1426
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,319
what kind of the liability properties

1427
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:52,079
seem to provide it was a core

1428
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,119
aim of the prayer of the Matrix critical

1429
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:56,160
to prevent any ability but it has not

1430
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,339
been also formally modeled so we will

1431
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:02,420
also be looking at that

1432
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:05,760
what

1433
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,480
time

1434
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,040
first time well thank you for doing this

1435
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,980
first of all I want to check if if I got

1436
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,300
it I mean are this the same

1437
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,500
vulnerabilities that were already

1438
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,599
discovered in I mean in released in

1439
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:21,059
September and I think fixed already in a

1440
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:22,559
good I'm interested for most of them I

1441
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,480
think there's a disagreement on one so

1442
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,160
just just to check if these are new ones

1443
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,599
or we've had the same that were already

1444
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,300
disclosed and and the other thing and I

1445
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,220
also wanted to say I I don't know if you

1446
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,079
were this morning if you attended the

1447
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,420
Mimi meeting you know but yeah it's very

1448
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,500
important that now you go there because

1449
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,420
I guess in the future you might converge

1450
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,220
on other protocols not on all my

1451
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,780
government it's very important that we

1452
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,500
get them right so

1453
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,940
yes they have the same vulnerabilities

1454
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,980
that we disclosed there's not anything

1455
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,319
you in this presentation besides what we

1456
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,599
already disclosed I also attended the

1457
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:55,619
mini

1458
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,500
um now future working group and I do

1459
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,839
hope that on those of them we do take

1460
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:03,000
the same lessons learned that we have

1461
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,420
from less than CLS 1.3 of actually

1462
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,339
making a group that has a collaboration

1463
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:10,200
between the academic Community formal

1464
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,660
methods and standardization value to put

1465
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,400
out there's something that's really safe

1466
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,760
and good

1467
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:19,980
thank you again for the presentation and

1468
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,319
if you do do part two please bring it

1469
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,640
back here and present it to us again

1470
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:29,059
thanks

1471
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,460
sorry we're so On Cue question that we

1472
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,160
missed uh not a key question just uh

1473
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,440
with respect to the formal analysis

1474
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,960
points on the last slide there's a side

1475
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,299
meeting in Richmond six tomorrow on

1476
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:45,440
doing formal records

1477
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,099
so we'll move on to the last

1478
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:55,260
presentation we have and this is by

1479
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,440
Simone basma of uni

1480
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,819
um some of you may have seen the brief

1481
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:02,220
presentation that was given yesterday I

1482
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,079
believe it was concentrating on

1483
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,420
censorship in Iran and this is a much

1484
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,299
more General talk about measurements of

1485
01:00:09,299 --> 01:00:11,880
Internet censorship globally please go

1486
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,720
ahead Simone thank you so uh it seems

1487
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,500
you can hear me hello uh so okay

1488
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,920
um first of all thanks for inviting me

1489
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,020
um I'm very happy to be here so I want

1490
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:25,980
to

1491
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,980
um basically provide you an overview of

1492
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,200
uh what one is doing for measuring

1493
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,260
censorship and I would like to focus a

1494
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,960
little bit more on measurements of

1495
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,440
encrypted protocols and I also want to

1496
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,720
um like focus a little bit more on the

1497
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,460
more experimental stuff that we are

1498
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,160
doing as opposed to uh like the mainline

1499
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,220
measurements that we are doing so let's

1500
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:55,140
uh say a few words about universe so

1501
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,180
it's a free software project it started

1502
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,760
in 2012. like the idea is to provide

1503
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,680
people with tools that they can install

1504
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,319
on their phones on their computers and

1505
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,720
use those tools to master internet

1506
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,460
censorship and the uh like over time we

1507
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,440
have collected the more than a billion

1508
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,140
Network measurements uh in more than 200

1509
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,980
countries the way in which it works is

1510
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,900
that you have this application for

1511
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,940
mobile or for a desktop or a command

1512
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,059
line application and you can choose what

1513
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:30,420
category or what which tasks inside the

1514
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,319
category to run or in a way Flagship

1515
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,440
experiment is the one for websites where

1516
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,099
basically we there is a list that the

1517
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:43,319
probe is going to measure a list of

1518
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:46,319
websites which depends on the country in

1519
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,619
which you are in or if you want you can

1520
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:52,319
choose custom websites for you to to

1521
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,920
measure and this will be uh part of what

1522
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,520
I will talking about in the presentation

1523
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,200
I will not focus much on instant

1524
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,980
messaging I will just say that we have

1525
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,359
this specific tasks for instance

1526
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:08,180
messaging apps where we measure

1527
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,700
endpoints that matter to those apps as

1528
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,799
first circumvention again I will not be

1529
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:17,880
focusing on it here but briefly and I

1530
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,200
think it's also related to previous

1531
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,599
conversations I've seen in the chat what

1532
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,040
we have is

1533
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,140
um we integrate siphon which is a

1534
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,059
conversion tool and so our task

1535
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:29,220
bootstrap siphons and tells you how much

1536
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,700
it takes we do the same for Tor uh the

1537
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,740
vanilla version so without any plugable

1538
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,500
transports we also integrate snowflakes

1539
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,720
so we can tell you how much it takes to

1540
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,900
bootstrap to our plus snowflake so and

1541
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,059
then we have also other kind of tasks

1542
01:02:45,059 --> 01:02:47,640
that um like so for example Performance

1543
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:52,319
tasks and middle box tests and then

1544
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,780
um while those are the tasks that are

1545
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,599
part of the application proper there is

1546
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,480
a huge amount while not huge amount but

1547
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,079
the fuel experimental tasks that do not

1548
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,380
run all the time or just from sometimes

1549
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,420
in the ground if you enable them and

1550
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,280
those are part of what I'm going to

1551
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,040
discuss in this presentation

1552
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,319
okay so

1553
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:20,160
um now I want to spend a little bit to

1554
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,480
explain uh the principles with which we

1555
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,640
measure and I will use as an example

1556
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,480
here measuring the web though measuring

1557
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,619
encrypted DNS is similar as a concept

1558
01:03:33,619 --> 01:03:37,619
not all the experiments that we have are

1559
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:40,500
at this um like are following these

1560
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,619
principles it took us experience to

1561
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,260
understand these principles and so only

1562
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,079
the most recent ones follow these

1563
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,420
principles though they are the ones that

1564
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,880
either we are using the most or we plan

1565
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,680
to be using the most so that's basically

1566
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,280
fine okay so the

1567
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,720
um first part is that we want to provide

1568
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,240
the probe to measure

1569
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,859
um like we want to pry the probe

1570
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:11,040
websites to answer and that is a URL but

1571
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,900
providing the URL in itself is not

1572
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,140
enough we need to know more about that

1573
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,160
URL

1574
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,799
it's important to know in advance what

1575
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:21,900
are non-good IP addresses for that

1576
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,160
domain which helps us to find out more

1577
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,299
ways in which uh a websites a website

1578
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:33,720
could be censored and then we also have

1579
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,900
ways to know uh more or less around the

1580
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,480
same time that the probe is performing a

1581
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,700
measurement whether the website is

1582
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,119
expected to be up and it's expected to

1583
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,059
working as intended basically okay we

1584
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:49,980
like so that's the first bubble

1585
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,440
basically uh the target to measure and

1586
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,420
contextual information that helps with

1587
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,839
measuring then there is the first

1588
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:01,319
um like uh Act of measuring which for

1589
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:07,140
web is a DNS lookup so uh we we in most

1590
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,480
cases and historically we tended to use

1591
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,579
got a dreamful and the reason for that

1592
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:14,400
is that in many countries so for example

1593
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,040
in Italy where I'm right now uh and many

1594
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,040
European countries most censorship

1595
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,319
um or historical Mass censorship has

1596
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:25,319
been uh implemented only by the resolver

1597
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:28,799
of the ISP so that's the historical

1598
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,720
reason why we use data dream for we

1599
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,119
don't always know what the result is

1600
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,859
sometimes it's easier than other times

1601
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:37,380
to discover it and so that's a way to to

1602
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:38,339
use that

1603
01:05:38,339 --> 01:05:41,640
but more recently we started to add in

1604
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,619
parallel another resolver and this one

1605
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:44,520
is

1606
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:49,319
um using the DNS unencrypted over 53 EDP

1607
01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:52,740
and the reason for that is that

1608
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,380
um in some cases get under info may be

1609
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:58,020
using an encrypted channel so for

1610
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,059
example we know that with systemly you

1611
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:03,960
can use dot etc etc and then what the

1612
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,220
additional

1613
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,040
um unencrypted query allows us to know

1614
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,980
whether there is a blanket interception

1615
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:15,000
or tampering with DNS requests which

1616
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,819
seems to be the case in most countries

1617
01:06:17,819 --> 01:06:20,520
so it's quite uncommon that you you have

1618
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,740
targeted filtering for a specific uh

1619
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:25,200
server endpoint in general it's foreign

1620
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,299
queries okay that that that that part of

1621
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:33,420
our like measurements give us IP

1622
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,599
addresses or errors and generally errors

1623
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:39,119
are like wait what we didn't expect this

1624
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,240
because in most cases we know that the

1625
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,500
website should be uh like addresses so

1626
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,180
in general when we see something

1627
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,880
unexpected uh compared to what we know

1628
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,180
to be true we call this an anomaly and

1629
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,640
then for IP addresses we are not sure

1630
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,400
whether they are good for the domain but

1631
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,400
when we are measuring encrypted websites

1632
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,200
um we we say they are good if we can't

1633
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,720
tell us and check with them because we

1634
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,200
bundle mozilla's CA we hope there is no

1635
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,440
Rogue CA in there and surely there is no

1636
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,160
extra CA that the user may have so okay

1637
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,000
um

1638
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,240
okay once we have a set of IP addresses

1639
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,220
which is the set that we already knew

1640
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,720
plus the one discovered by the probe

1641
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,299
then what we do is basically construct

1642
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:30,420
endpoints from those addresses and then

1643
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:33,780
we do the what is required to do so for

1644
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,660
https that's mostly TCP connect Tela

1645
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,099
Centric and then trying to get the

1646
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:40,020
resource and each of these operations

1647
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:43,260
could fail and then if we expected it

1648
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,240
not to fail if it fails we are again

1649
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,180
into the a this is an anomaly territory

1650
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:51,660
so yeah those are the principles and uh

1651
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,460
um like

1652
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,700
users Runway and then there is a backend

1653
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,039
and the backend uh is actually import

1654
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,200
very important to us even though users

1655
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,640
do not see it and it organizes

1656
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,799
measurements and it has an API and

1657
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,480
through the API

1658
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,859
um and for a website called Luna

1659
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:09,720
Explorer researchers including us and

1660
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,900
users they can fetch measurements and

1661
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,339
they can also

1662
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:15,900
um not only fetch individual

1663
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,819
measurements but also group measurements

1664
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:21,500
and try to make sense of measurements uh

1665
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,439
like looking at charts that show Trends

1666
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,080
in general slash reports is where we

1667
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,600
publish reports on our websites and now

1668
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,819
that I think I covered all the basics

1669
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:35,219
what I want to do is to um

1670
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:38,698
so basically discuss a bunch of recent

1671
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,859
words that we did but rather than giving

1672
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:44,399
a broad view I want to show some into

1673
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,799
some aspects that I consider interesting

1674
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,399
that we are working on what we found so

1675
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,979
the first report I want to focus on is

1676
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:56,460
this one uh that was about Iran and so

1677
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,439
um this is about the Maza mini protests

1678
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:01,439
and it was at the end of September of

1679
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,540
this month and

1680
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:06,899
there was uh already loss of disruption

1681
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:09,779
in Iran before the protests but

1682
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,640
something changed around the protests

1683
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,179
and so for example here we have uh a

1684
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:20,279
math chart of DNS over https each row is

1685
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:22,380
a service and

1686
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:26,460
um each each bar in in the chart is the

1687
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,799
its height is the number of measurements

1688
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,198
collected on a specific day and then

1689
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:34,500
it's divided in different colors and

1690
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,479
each color is a class okay means

1691
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:39,238
everything literally everything was okay

1692
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:41,698
um then we uh anomaly I told you already

1693
01:09:41,698 --> 01:09:44,399
what anomaly means it means basically we

1694
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,859
expected something to happen but there

1695
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:48,839
was a networker we didn't expect that's

1696
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:50,640
mostly what an anomaly means in this

1697
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,540
context

1698
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,900
and then confirm and confirmed

1699
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,360
um in general means that there are

1700
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,400
signatures known signatures of

1701
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,920
censorship and we found some of those

1702
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,860
signatures inside the data in the case

1703
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:08,280
of Iran that mostly means bogans uh

1704
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,340
Bogan AP addresses that are known to uh

1705
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,719
be used to implement censorship now if

1706
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:17,940
you see basically the colors Trend here

1707
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,100
you see that after the 21st for most

1708
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,219
Services it changes from yellow anomaly

1709
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,520
to rad confirmed uh what I wanted to do

1710
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,960
here which is

1711
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,020
um like uh a bit more in-depth I wanted

1712
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,739
to show you what happened for Doh

1713
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:37,679
dnasapple.com on the 24th so

1714
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,860
um yeah oops Yeah next slide cool okay

1715
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,719
so

1716
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:43,260
um

1717
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:46,560
when I told you our principles uh for

1718
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,659
measuring I told you that we provide the

1719
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:51,179
probes with non-good IP addresses this

1720
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:53,520
means we can uh regardless of what

1721
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,360
happens for DNS we can track whether we

1722
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,060
can establish connections with no good

1723
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,800
IP addresses and see what happens for

1724
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,380
that okay and this table shows that so

1725
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,659
the First Column is the s number the

1726
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:08,040
last column is the number of times

1727
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,260
something happened and the other columns

1728
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,719
in the middle allows us to classify

1729
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,699
um how many times we did see specific

1730
01:11:14,699 --> 01:11:17,880
blocking patterns so DNS means DNS was

1731
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,040
blocked and TCP means TCP was blocked

1732
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,920
Etc okay and success means something was

1733
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,719
okay and

1734
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,960
um in in uh and like for resital for

1735
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,300
example the first row uh ddns always

1736
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,760
failed and it always failed with one of

1737
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,580
the three bob-ons shown above so that

1738
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,620
was that basically means that if you

1739
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:40,860
just use the DNS uh local yanas uh

1740
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,560
either the get a dream resolver or our

1741
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,199
EDP you will not be able to go further

1742
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:48,120
but we provided the probe we type

1743
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,880
addresses and so when we use those AP

1744
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,340
addresses uh we always fail in the

1745
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,620
tiller Centric and we failed with this

1746
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,239
signature that you send the client hello

1747
01:11:57,239 --> 01:11:59,460
and then nothing happens then eventually

1748
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,920
you time out because you're tired of

1749
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,480
waiting

1750
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,480
um another Network TCI at the similar

1751
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,260
pattern again DNS block same way however

1752
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,900
the uh a good IP addresses that we

1753
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,880
provided to the probe failed into

1754
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,239
distinct way so sometimes uh it was this

1755
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,280
it was timing out during the TCP connect

1756
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,380
for other let's say more luck AP

1757
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,199
addresses instead you were able to

1758
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,500
establish a TCP connection but then you

1759
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,780
were still timing out in the telecentric

1760
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,719
and that happened 21 times and but five

1761
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:35,400
times it happened something that is

1762
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,080
quite interesting

1763
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,719
um a few of those AP addresses that we

1764
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:42,179
provided they were actually working so

1765
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:44,040
they were succeeding and and this

1766
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,320
suggests and it's not the first time we

1767
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,540
have seen this opening in Iran that

1768
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:54,000
there is not just a um like some if in

1769
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,699
the network that if the asanai of the

1770
01:12:56,699 --> 01:12:59,520
client law is such and such you're

1771
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,380
blocked it's a bit more complicated than

1772
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,840
that it also depends on DP addresses

1773
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,120
that are using and it's Dynamic so

1774
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,179
probably depending on what people do

1775
01:13:08,179 --> 01:13:11,100
that's a speculation but I will support

1776
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,560
that that seems I mean that's my mental

1777
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,900
model of what I have seen basically that

1778
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,300
it depends on what IP addresses are used

1779
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:22,020
and it seems to change okay so this is

1780
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:26,460
um it for this specific case now another

1781
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,600
case

1782
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,780
was this studied we did for Russia at

1783
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:33,420
the beginning of the war and

1784
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:37,380
um again I'm not going to bro like uh

1785
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,960
describe the whole case I just want to

1786
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,820
flag something that I found quite

1787
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:44,159
interesting uh so at the beginning of

1788
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:47,820
the of the world in Russia in Ukraine uh

1789
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:52,199
what we did see in um opening in Russia

1790
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:54,480
what many people did see is that Twitter

1791
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,719
was very difficult to use and so uh the

1792
01:13:57,719 --> 01:13:59,880
conclusion was that it was throttle then

1793
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,400
many people published about this

1794
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,199
um and we also published about this and

1795
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:07,140
the way in which we saw that was there

1796
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,900
was this form of tracking uh was like

1797
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,580
like this so we

1798
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,640
um when we are the lesson shaking we

1799
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,120
record the time stamp and the amount of

1800
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,940
bytes received by Raj

1801
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:24,540
um and then uh by collecting this data

1802
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,820
we're able to say uh at the end of the

1803
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:29,460
handshake regardless of the result how

1804
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,320
much data we were able to fetch in how

1805
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,120
much time so basically that's the speed

1806
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,760
and the unshake size is more or less the

1807
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,040
same in the sense that you need to fetch

1808
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:42,000
the same data like certificates Etc so

1809
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,179
um what we saw uh was that you can quite

1810
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:46,920
like there was two two populations

1811
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,440
basically a population of users through

1812
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,140
which the telecentric for Twitter uh was

1813
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:55,380
at let's say the speed that we could saw

1814
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,900
before this problem so at the beginning

1815
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:01,199
of the chart the 24th of February and

1816
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:04,679
then uh suddenly on the 26th some users

1817
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:06,600
instead were having this very slow

1818
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,100
handshakes

1819
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,800
um and then if you go and look you see

1820
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,239
that those measurements with the very

1821
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:14,580
slow handshakes uh they were timing out

1822
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:16,500
in the Android or timing outward trying

1823
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,900
to fetch uh what we were trying to fetch

1824
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:21,540
which was an image so that was the way

1825
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,239
in which we detected the signature of

1826
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:26,340
throttling in our data

1827
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,040
um it was not something that we planned

1828
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,940
for we actually added these data

1829
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:35,159
collection part because we thought it

1830
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:36,719
was useful but we didn't think about

1831
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,540
throttling and that was fortunate that

1832
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,520
we did this and now what we are trying

1833
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,699
to do is to have something similar also

1834
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:47,040
while we're fetching the body which will

1835
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,739
help us to detect this form of trucking

1836
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:52,199
and I guess the message here is that the

1837
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:53,880
kind of throttling that you would expect

1838
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,219
when you want to disrupt something is

1839
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:59,580
very very heavy uh because in a way you

1840
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:00,840
want to

1841
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,360
um like you want to be below a certain

1842
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,820
bandwidth that makes it very difficult

1843
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,880
to use the application at the end of the

1844
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,380
day so uh okay the third aspect I want

1845
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:18,480
to focus on is that I so far I basically

1846
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,780
um discussed only TCP based measurements

1847
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,880
however

1848
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,699
we have been starting to look into quick

1849
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:30,380
as well and uh while the mainline

1850
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:33,960
website measuring experiment that does

1851
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,960
not contain code for quick we have

1852
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,239
experimental experiments that we have

1853
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:42,179
run in some cases that do and we are

1854
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:44,580
looking forward to merge those into the

1855
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:48,780
mainland experiment and so again I am

1856
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:50,760
not going to discuss everything I just

1857
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,040
try to discuss something that we are

1858
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:56,699
trying to look at uh this was run from

1859
01:16:56,699 --> 01:17:00,060
China and we had this opportunity to

1860
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,760
basically have a list of websites that

1861
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,480
were available with https

1862
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:10,800
or HTTP 3 and we tried to test this like

1863
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,040
both and the idea was to see uh what

1864
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,000
happens

1865
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,920
um like if something is blocked for

1866
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,860
https what happens to the same website

1867
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,080
on http 3.

1868
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,900
and so there is this basically diagram

1869
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,580
where on the left we have the clusters

1870
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,699
of failures connection reset a TLS

1871
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:32,699
timeout and Shake success and

1872
01:17:32,699 --> 01:17:35,580
um timeout while connecting TCP and

1873
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:38,400
those translate quite neatly to other

1874
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,340
categories that matter for HTTP 3 so for

1875
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,620
example while other which honestly I

1876
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:45,300
don't remember what it is but was very

1877
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:48,179
rare uh success and

1878
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:51,600
um quick and fake timeout so what we

1879
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,940
already knew and it was a bit confirmed

1880
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,040
by looking into this is that in China

1881
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,860
it's very very common to block IP

1882
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:02,880
addresses and we we're not sure whether

1883
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,760
and honestly we cannot be able to say

1884
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,040
it's IP addresses or endpoints but

1885
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,920
certainly the endpoints that were

1886
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,800
blocked for TCP were also blocked for

1887
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,480
UDP uh you see that like this 24 percent

1888
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,640
uh fraction translates to a more or less

1889
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,179
equal attraction for week instead the

1890
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:26,699
majority of the sites that were blocked

1891
01:18:26,699 --> 01:18:29,100
with connection reset or timed out

1892
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,360
during the unshake they were actually

1893
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:34,199
accessible now this is not recent it's

1894
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:37,800
six months no it's far from four or five

1895
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,860
months ago so maybe now it's not like

1896
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:43,199
it's not exactly the same it could have

1897
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,420
changed though at the time that's what

1898
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,460
we were seeing

1899
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,659
um

1900
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:52,140
okay so we we we were asking the

1901
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,120
question whether okay but is this really

1902
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,520
that they are blocking you for factory

1903
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,120
European points what it is like so we

1904
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,340
did this other we created these other

1905
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,460
small tool called quick Pane and so the

1906
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,560
idea of quick think is that we want to

1907
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,360
decoupling way

1908
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,420
um the the fact that quick quick is like

1909
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,060
um embeds the transport part and the

1910
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:16,920
Telus part in the same

1911
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,920
um like pocket anyway so so we we sent

1912
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,280
an initial quick bucket minimum size and

1913
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,920
in depart that should have been kelas

1914
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,980
was random but we sent a version

1915
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,960
negotiation that was

1916
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,960
um if I recall correctly Baba in

1917
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,659
hexadecimal so that was invalid so the

1918
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:39,300
idea is that we send this invalid

1919
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,640
um bucket and because the version is

1920
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,920
invalid we expected to receive something

1921
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,800
and at the time at least that seemed to

1922
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,380
work as like we were receiving Pinback

1923
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,580
from service

1924
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,460
so we tried this in that context and

1925
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,920
what we actually discovered is basically

1926
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,520
that no as far as we could tell at the

1927
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,580
time the timeouts that we were seeing

1928
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,280
with HTTP 3 on the left were mostly

1929
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,820
timeouts for Ping so it did not seem at

1930
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,560
the time this was

1931
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,280
um

1932
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,640
basically caused by uh inspection of the

1933
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,219
TLs part of quick even though again

1934
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:19,679
quick is a new protocol and time flies

1935
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:23,400
and so maybe now it has changed so but

1936
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,739
yeah at the time we didn't notice this

1937
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,260
kind of

1938
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:31,440
potential interference okay now this is

1939
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,679
the last topic to touch upon the DNS

1940
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:36,840
track experiment so this experiment

1941
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,300
follows the philosophy I described you

1942
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,960
at the beginning uh like the way in

1943
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,000
which we try to organize measurements so

1944
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,760
there is nothing really new to say here

1945
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,100
but that there is an experiment in uni

1946
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,320
that is dedicated specifically to

1947
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,260
measuring Dot and Doh and that

1948
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,760
experiment tries to follow this

1949
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,800
principle of providing the probes with

1950
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,900
IP addresses that are good for the

1951
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,480
domain so we are happy that we even if

1952
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,060
we are getting a censored locally we

1953
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:09,719
have good IP addresses to try

1954
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:13,440
um and the other good news is that this

1955
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,820
experiment

1956
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,360
um is now in uniprobe and

1957
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,040
like as I mentioned before in the

1958
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,480
uniprobe there is a section called

1959
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,400
experimental that you can run manually

1960
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,159
or you can ask the only app to run it

1961
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,440
automatically along with other tasks and

1962
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,020
so we now start to add data about this

1963
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,840
uh even though we have not looked

1964
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,420
actively into this data because while we

1965
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:39,780
are a small team and uh yeah it's uh

1966
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,820
um like recent months have been very bad

1967
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:44,100
in terms of censorship so it I've always

1968
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,320
wanted to look into this but I could not

1969
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,800
do much so far though what we can do and

1970
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,739
what we are working towards doing right

1971
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:53,580
now

1972
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:57,060
um is we are trying to take our uh let's

1973
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:00,600
see scripts that we use for for writing

1974
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,300
reports and convert them into tools that

1975
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,540
everyone can use with any data uh and so

1976
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:09,120
uh these charts here are produced by

1977
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,940
these new tools and the uh what I find

1978
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:13,860
quite cool about these new tools is that

1979
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:16,260
they explode measurements so

1980
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,140
um like every experiment produces its

1981
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,420
own kind of Json measurements but these

1982
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:24,000
tools they like come back down and so

1983
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,280
every experiment needs to do TCP connect

1984
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,260
and it's in the same way and tell us

1985
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:31,260
likewise so they will create those

1986
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,780
tables that all experiments will end up

1987
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:36,120
filling TCP tables until last tables Etc

1988
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,340
and so now we are able to do stuff like

1989
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,800
okay give me all the TLs connections

1990
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,020
that we have for this domain

1991
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,719
um regardless of the experiment and then

1992
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:48,120
uh of course those are the ones that

1993
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,880
arrived to the TCP point so you need to

1994
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,800
have TCP let us be worked at that point

1995
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,820
but yeah

1996
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,140
um so that that's something we are

1997
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,199
working to do so here is uh data from

1998
01:22:58,199 --> 01:23:01,620
DNS track and I I tried to like uh yeah

1999
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:05,400
the basically the meaning of the rows is

2000
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,340
cloud Fair Doh domain means the URL that

2001
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:10,500
you will use for cloudflare Doh which is

2002
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,020
quite long so it was not fitting in the

2003
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,219
chart

2004
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:17,760
Etc and we tried to provide like um a

2005
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,580
view of what it was looking like 10 days

2006
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:22,679
ago or something for China Iran

2007
01:23:22,679 --> 01:23:26,100
Kazakhstan Qatar and Saudi Arabia and

2008
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,500
that is just connections that are at the

2009
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,540
TLs stage and they are trying to tell us

2010
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:31,739
Centric

2011
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:33,659
um and then another thing we are trying

2012
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:36,420
to improve on is we are trying to rather

2013
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,699
than providing this yellow anomaly which

2014
01:23:38,699 --> 01:23:40,500
is a bit like of a container for

2015
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,960
anomalies we say Okay

2016
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,120
um this is the the kind of failure that

2017
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,340
we have so it's more more interesting to

2018
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,860
know uh like you can directly see the

2019
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:51,600
fraction of connection result or

2020
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,360
timeouts okay I'm concluding so the

2021
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,880
final thing I wanted to mention is that

2022
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:57,800
um

2023
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,440
uh we we are trying to improve and I

2024
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,880
told you already ways in which you are

2025
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,860
trying to improve and Anonymous our debt

2026
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:06,300
in a better way and made this available

2027
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,040
to everyone as opposed to being Justin

2028
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,739
for us uh other stuff we are working on

2029
01:24:10,739 --> 01:24:13,520
I would really love to have better deal

2030
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,920
doh3 and doq support for DNS Chuck so we

2031
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,320
have better data about those as well

2032
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,600
um it's very important to make sure we

2033
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,060
are using the the I would say the Chrome

2034
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,239
browser's fingerprint uh because

2035
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,860
currently our toolizingo and the

2036
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:31,440
fingerprint that we have uh is not the

2037
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,420
one that Chrome would use and sometimes

2038
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,580
they go fingerprint is associated with

2039
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,560
their conversion tools so we want to

2040
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,420
remove confounding factors here that's

2041
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,520
another thing we want to do then we want

2042
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,920
to integrate quick into the myelin

2043
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,800
experiment that's I think uh yeah those

2044
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,080
are the most important things we want to

2045
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:52,020
do and with that I think uh we reached

2046
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,640
the undend I'm happy to take any

2047
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,880
questions

2048
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:58,320
thank you very much for the excellent

2049
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,000
work and for the great presentation

2050
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,400
we'll open the queue for questions now

2051
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,580
yeah can you state your name you're not

2052
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:12,120
in the yes thank you I'm Marco Davis I

2053
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,100
work for sidn thank you Simon for this

2054
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,440
interesting presentation

2055
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,159
um

2056
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:19,980
I have a question I was wondering

2057
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:23,120
um are you interested and do you look at

2058
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:27,480
the the root cause of any blocking of

2059
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,480
internet access for example uh

2060
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,360
our company's website as at the end.net

2061
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,420
is blocked from Iran but that's not

2062
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:37,860
because the Iranian government or

2063
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,600
anything has decided that is because

2064
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,900
Google Cloud platform has decided to

2065
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,760
block traffic from Iran to their

2066
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,640
customers which we are one of them

2067
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:50,040
yeah is that relevant for you that kind

2068
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,780
of distinction between who is blocking

2069
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,820
and what the reasons why you cannot

2070
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:56,100
access from a certain country to a

2071
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,080
certain site or location

2072
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,080
yeah so excellent point excellent

2073
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:04,699
question it is not something we can uh

2074
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:07,920
as far as I know measure directly with

2075
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,159
our tool but indirectly we can in the

2076
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:12,840
sense that yes we are aware of the

2077
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:15,420
problem we have a community of users and

2078
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,820
they have raised this problem with us so

2079
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:20,460
we try when we analyze and produce

2080
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:24,360
reports to always keep that in mind and

2081
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,120
my recollection is that the way in which

2082
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,460
it is blocked on Google is that you got

2083
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:33,120
a 403 so that's correct I will say that

2084
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,420
we can see that in the data because you

2085
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:38,580
don't see a connection result or a

2086
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:42,380
timeout but you see so

2087
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:44,880
in fact you even see a valid TLS

2088
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:49,139
connection so that might also be a hinge

2089
01:26:49,139 --> 01:26:50,639
um yeah

2090
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:51,199
yeah

2091
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:56,120
so thank you yeah thank you

2092
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,400
next in queue we have Alex

2093
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,219
hi uh Alexey Google I was wondering if

2094
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:03,960
you're planning any extensions to your

2095
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,060
quick ping Tool uh from quickly looking

2096
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,920
at it it looks like you're only sending

2097
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,540
like the version negotiation aspects and

2098
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:10,800
one of the things that I believe we've

2099
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,719
seen in the wild is that there are some

2100
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,159
middle boxes which look at specific

2101
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,300
offsets because they don't understand

2102
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:18,000
quick and therefore if they are looking

2103
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,860
for things like you know Sni which I

2104
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:23,639
think moved between draft 29 and RFC uh

2105
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:24,719
then they end up blocking because

2106
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:26,040
they're trying to allow lists on things

2107
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,540
in the public handshake which means that

2108
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,620
you're I believe you're a quick ping

2109
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:29,940
tool if it doesn't consider that sort of

2110
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:32,460
case would erroneously say that the

2111
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,800
connection is allowed whereas if you

2112
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,300
actually try to establish a full quick

2113
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,520
connection it would get denied

2114
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,520
yeah so I'm happy to be here because

2115
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,620
there is people like you that can tell

2116
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:46,020
me this stuff that I was not aware of so

2117
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:48,420
I'm grateful no we are not doing that we

2118
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:51,300
should and actually if we can get in

2119
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,100
contact with some of the contacts that

2120
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,980
it's there I would love to know more and

2121
01:27:55,980 --> 01:28:00,199
improve our tools thank you

2122
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:05,280
uh next we have uh dkg remotely

2123
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,420
hello

2124
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:08,340
um thanks for this presentation you're

2125
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:11,300
really quiet

2126
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,960
thanks for the presentation and um and

2127
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,460
thank you for all the work on New Year

2128
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,500
if I'm blasting out the speakers I could

2129
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,179
turn it down further

2130
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:21,960
um

2131
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,139
uh I was wondering if you have uh

2132
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:27,300
any insight or if you can share any

2133
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:28,679
insight into the decisions you make

2134
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:31,020
about what to gather

2135
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:33,900
um in particular I was just testing the

2136
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:36,780
uni probe and it identified some

2137
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:39,320
blockages uh

2138
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,420
uh which I'm not sure are correct so I'm

2139
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:44,100
trying to figure out I'm looking at the

2140
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,020
data that it gathered

2141
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,699
um and I noticed that some of the things

2142
01:28:47,699 --> 01:28:50,280
will say you know this has failed in

2143
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:53,400
this way and other tests like the SSL

2144
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,800
unknown Authority

2145
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,960
um response I believe actually sends the

2146
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,520
peer certificates that were gathered so

2147
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,139
you're actually building or you're

2148
01:29:01,139 --> 01:29:02,699
you're retrieving a data set of those

2149
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:04,620
things I'm wondering how how do you

2150
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,179
think about how much information do you

2151
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:07,739
want to take

2152
01:29:07,739 --> 01:29:08,520
um

2153
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,159
versus like it's useful for identifying

2154
01:29:11,159 --> 01:29:13,080
technical routes and then some of it

2155
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,760
might actually be cause problems for the

2156
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,260
users that you're Gathering From I

2157
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,280
wonder if you could just talk a little

2158
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,780
bit about how

2159
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:22,440
um you know to reflect the the quest you

2160
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,080
know the first talk of this session uh

2161
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,940
David Oliver's talk about

2162
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,020
um

2163
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,639
you know how do how do we gather

2164
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:31,560
measurements in a responsible way I'm

2165
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,060
assuming you guys have thought about

2166
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:36,679
that and I'm wondering what you know

2167
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,880
gotcha yeah so the I I actually did not

2168
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,880
mention this but the there is

2169
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,659
documentation about what we collect and

2170
01:29:48,659 --> 01:29:51,840
when you install any tool including the

2171
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,659
experimental command line client it

2172
01:29:54,659 --> 01:29:58,380
tries to explain in a concise way and it

2173
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:01,320
tells you look we are uh not an

2174
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,719
anonymity tool quite the contrary so

2175
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:06,780
your traffic is traffic that may stand

2176
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:10,199
and therefore you should read our

2177
01:30:10,199 --> 01:30:12,600
um basically on inform constant

2178
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,260
documentation if you consult with that

2179
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:19,620
uh which uh yeah and then it's it's much

2180
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,860
nicer in the mobile apps or in in

2181
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,260
general in the desktop apps because it

2182
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:27,360
it tries yeah like it's not a common

2183
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,520
line tool so it tries to give you

2184
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,699
um like more and also another thing that

2185
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:35,400
we do is that after we provided these

2186
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,900
bits of information

2187
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,719
we ask to the user

2188
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:43,800
um questions like uh is the only problem

2189
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:46,920
going to do xyzad and they need to say

2190
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,800
true false to demonstrate that they have

2191
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,040
understood uh what the tool can do I I

2192
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,080
don't remember by Art the exact

2193
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:58,020
questions but something like a question

2194
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:00,840
could be like if you're using uniprobe

2195
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:03,300
your ISP could see that you are using

2196
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:06,300
unipro true or false and if the user

2197
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,239
says false we pop up and say no look

2198
01:31:09,239 --> 01:31:11,520
actually that's not the case because it

2199
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,400
is a measurement to uh it's not like

2200
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,520
that so we try to educate the users and

2201
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,460
we try to have documentation about

2202
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:21,120
um

2203
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,760
about your community does at different

2204
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,340
levels of complexity

2205
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,500
and we also have I mentioned that we

2206
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,840
have experimental experiments and that's

2207
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,820
part of why we have experimental

2208
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:37,020
experiments so uh the the you cannot run

2209
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:39,000
experimental experiments with the normal

2210
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,739
client you need to download the specific

2211
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:44,219
client which is not super advertised so

2212
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:45,540
you need to know what you're doing if

2213
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,639
you run experimental stuff which means

2214
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:49,580
you are self-selecting yourself already

2215
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:53,219
I hope this answers to your questions

2216
01:31:53,219 --> 01:31:55,679
yeah thanks I I thought it was

2217
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,600
interesting to see the pop quiz uh

2218
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,880
approach to trying to confirm that the

2219
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,620
user actually understands that's it I

2220
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:02,580
thought that was an interesting thing

2221
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:04,080
especially during the earlier talk

2222
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,139
thanks thanks

2223
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:09,000
um we're a little bit over time is this

2224
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,880
a very quick class question if you can

2225
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,040
can you take it to the chat or to the

2226
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:17,280
list and that's great so that's

2227
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,040
thanks again for the presentation Simone

2228
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,540
thanks

2229
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:23,280
uh that's everything for our meeting

2230
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,080
today thank you all for coming and we

2231
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,840

2232
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,159
thanks all see ya

2233
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:16,920
at the beginning and I thought

2234
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,020
leave it

2235
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:21,080
yeah

2236
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,800
um

2237
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:26,780
[Music]

2238
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:31,080
do you uh know what happened last time

2239
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,620
later

2240
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:38,400
what time are you heading out to that uh

2241
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,080
7pm okay

2242
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,239
okay I'm gonna be in half between six

2243
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,900
and seven if you happen to be around

2244
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:47,940
yeah that sounds great

2245
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:50,780
when is the battery

2246
01:33:52,679 --> 01:33:55,219
five

2247
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:57,799
