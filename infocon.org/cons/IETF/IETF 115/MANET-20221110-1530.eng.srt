1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,339
foreign

2
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,640
okay

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,300
hello everyone

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,320
um

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,500
welcome to the Monet session

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,860
at IDF 115

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,360
.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,880
I think we have a bit less people in the

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,520
room or in online than last time but

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,460
then we had the combined session with

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,719
row and Babel

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,180
and now uh

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,239
a couple of our uh

14
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,820
strongest supporters are in the drip

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,539
session as well

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,939
this is the node well

17
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,520
you should be familiar with this if not

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,780
quickly go read it

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,320
um

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,279
it is important

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,799
you may have seen this

22
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,900
earlier this week

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,820
but um

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,280
The Mask wearing part is most important

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,040
so unless you're actively speaking at

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,400
the microphone wear your mask

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,740
so even if you're passively speaking at

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,420
the microphone you should also wear a

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,540
mask

30
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,820
these are General resources

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,579
you've probably seen that

32
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,060
and specifically for this Monet session

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,140
um

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,119
well you probably uh

35
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,979
I've seen that as well

36
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,800
um it would be good if there was someone

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,260
or several persons in the room that uh

38
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,700
um could use a notepad to make some

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,060
notes

40
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,220
this is our agenda

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,420
it has been updated

42
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,580
today

43
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,900
because yesterday I got the offer by uh

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,540
by Sarah to present

45
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,660
um

46
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,720
dtn management architecture

47
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,500
as you may remember at burain presented

48
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,819
this in the online meeting itf-112

49
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,440
and since then

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,099
um there have been some updates

51
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:05,819
to digitma and I still think this could

52
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,900
also

53
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,640
have used for the Malay working group

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,140
so the updates have come to be presented

55
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,559
by Sarah

56
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,599
at the end uh

57
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,120
we will have a re-chartering uh

58
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,239
discussion that I should have

59
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,120
discussed with our ID before but I did

60
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,340
not so apologies for that

61
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,720
so he's coming in with gold Maybe

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,580
um but we see how far we get with that

63
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,980
and uh

64
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,019
we can always continue on the mailing

65
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,200
list

66
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,879
draft status

67
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,260
um

68
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,360
we have some drafts that have been with

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,060
the working group for a very long time

70
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,260
and there's a cluster of four drafts

71
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,859
that uh

72
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,140
discusses credit based flow control

73
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,640
um

74
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,500
three out of these four drafts have

75
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,120
undergone

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,680
um

77
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,760
transport area review

78
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,699
um some very good comments have been

79
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,960
received

80
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,660
also a long time ago

81
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,060
and there's still

82
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,340
a discussion going on

83
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,280
between uh David black who did the

84
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,600
review and uh the authors

85
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,000
but the discussion is converging and

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,020
there are only a few open issues left

87
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,080
um which we will come to uh

88
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,800
a bit later

89
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,220
um

90
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,960
I've been a bit uh Lexi my uh my task of

91
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,000
doing uh

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,160
Shepherd write-ups which would be the

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,120
next step

94
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,300
um

95
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,220
I understand I have to follow the new

96
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,000
template that was uh

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,660
published in July of this year

98
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,780
um

99
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,880
and I will do that of course I may have

100
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,759
to get back to the authors on some of

101
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,080
the questions

102
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,560
especially on the one on

103
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,080
implementation status

104
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,359
I'm not aware of any implementations

105
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,620
but it's one of the questions on the

106
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,720
on the shepherd

107
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,600
write-up template

108
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,160
um

109
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,479
and then

110
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,940
I understand

111
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,860
that there's a new thing that uh

112
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:59,960
drafts in the

113
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,820
rooting area routing area also have to

114
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,240
go through a routing area review

115
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,199
early review

116
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,560
um

117
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,740
and a question to our ads if that also

118
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,960
applies to these drafts that have been

119
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,479
around for some time

120
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,360
I'm not against it but uh

121
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,400
yes of course it applies to everything

122
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,919
okay so we've been just so that everyone

123
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,259
knows where this is coming from uh we've

124
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,100
been talking to our chairs about how to

125
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,840
improve the overall quality of the

126
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,979
documents

127
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,160
and so we've asked everyone all the

128
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,620
chairs and all the working groups to do

129
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,080
a routing

130
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,780
director of review before requesting

131
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,660
publication you can do that at working

132
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,419
group last call or around that uh you

133
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:52,680
know the important thing is that there's

134
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,419
one before

135
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,720
um and the other thing that we asked

136
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,819
um already is

137
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,620
obviously not for these ones that have

138
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,900
been around for a long time but uh early

139
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,979
assignment of uh Shepherds so that you

140
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,180
know we have someone sort of following

141
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,340
the document and looking at the issues

142
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,380
and whatever before uh as the document

143
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,139
advances thanks

144
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,660
thank you

145
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,720
um

146
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,740
so there's this is one this fourth uh

147
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,080
draft in this cluster

148
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
which is the uh

149
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,720
ether based ethernet based credit

150
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,919
extension

151
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,460
that has not had uh

152
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,639
transfer to Aria review

153
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,580
put it well soon

154
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,660
um

155
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,840
I talked to David black today

156
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,000
always done the other tree

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,419
and he asked me to

158
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,120
to indicate when I submit this one for

159
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,759
review that he has done the other tree

160
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,940
and that this one should also end up

161
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,680
with him then

162
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,780
and I will do that

163
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,520
then I think we have to um

164
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,919
make sure that the few remaining issues

165
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,860
with the other tree are resolved and

166
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,819
that

167
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,759
seems to me then a good point to submit

168
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,259
them for routing area review

169
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,460
because otherwise

170
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,679
might be changes coming in response to

171
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,559
the transport area I think as you go

172
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,719
ahead

173
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,179
my suggestion is go right now these

174
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,339
things are pretty mature I can't imagine

175
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:45,959
we're going to do a lot of change if

176
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,600
there is a lot of change

177
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,399
um I think we're going to have a longer

178
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,620
discussion

179
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,680
yes and some of the discussion

180
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,200
maybe minutes away from now

181
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,560
okay

182
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,600
so one thing that has almost been

183
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,540
discussed to death uh in the working

184
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,360
group is uh better or not to merge some

185
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
of these uh documents

186
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,440
um

187
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
and this was last discussed in the March

188
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,779
meeting in Vienna

189
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,980
and the working group decided no

190
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,480
um

191
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,600
even though the

192
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,040
the

193
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,839
transport area reviewer made a strong

194
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,120
suggestion that we we should merge uh

195
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,000
several of them or two of them uh with

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,980
the working group's decision was not to

197
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,480
do it

198
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,720
and he said it's fine uh

199
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,600
record this decision in the shepherd's

200
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,760
write-up which I will do

201
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,380
um I think

202
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,899
the other

203
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,380
three major

204
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,100
um issues and the one minor issues

205
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,279
are actually not that major and uh

206
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,980
just require a bit of uh rewording

207
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,519
um

208
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,740
and I think we should be able to fix

209
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,480
those fairly quickly no

210
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,580
however

211
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,360
um

212
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,560
at the risk of Lou throwing things at me

213
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,700
I'm going to revisit this uh

214
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,720
merging or not merging uh things one

215
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,019
more time

216
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,600
to remind everybody what this is about

217
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,360
we have four drafts

218
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,620
one is specifying two new messages two

219
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,279
extension messages to deal up and uh

220
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,800
five data items that go into these

221
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,660
various messages

222
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,459
then there's a traffic classification

223
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,540
draft that uh just uh specifies a single

224
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,740
new data item with two subdata items

225
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,100
and then there is the uh d-lab dish of

226
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,540
America credit extension and the

227
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,959
disservice

228
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,839
ether or rather IEEE

229
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,240
802.1 Q extension

230
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,500
that are very uh

231
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,940
low on substance because the only uh

232
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,560
Define an extension type

233
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,699
encapsulated in local boilerplate

234
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:50,000
and I'm going to propose something now

235
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,260
because the complaint was always about

236
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,300
this uh

237
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,420
these credit extensions

238
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,100
that I had only uh five or six pages

239
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,339
and I think what we could do

240
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,260
is move the ship data item definitions

241
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,640
to these documents

242
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,540
and then the traffic classification

243
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,339
document will be

244
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,260
totally generic

245
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,660
which means that if we ever decide to uh

246
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,560
Define or specify yet another traffic

247
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,180
classification mechanism maybe based on

248
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,060
the 524 or 624 or something like that

249
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,700
then this uh

250
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,220
rfe as it will be by then

251
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,980
never need to be changed again

252
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,600
and

253
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,899
um it will be then uh yet another good

254
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,440
extension uh draft which will

255
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,560
uh Define its own subdata item

256
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,740
so that's my uh

257
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,420
proposal and uh you can shoot it down

258
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,399
and one of the reasons for shooting it

259
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,980
down is that it is very very late in the

260
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,000
process

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,339
and you might not want to be want to be

262
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,079
going this road

263
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,899
but uh yeah I'd like to hear your

264
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,560
European

265
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,060
uh Rick Taylor very quickly

266
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,500
um plus one

267
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,899
to to that proposal role

268
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,040
um I think it makes a great deal of

269
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,779
sense having based documents as

270
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,959
references from other items just as you

271
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,820
say cuts down on the amount of churn on

272
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,740
on documents

273
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,600
I think I suggested it some years ago

274
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,300
but it's fine I think it's a good idea I

275
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,680
know it's late but let's get it right

276
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,100
heila Burger I completely agree on

277
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,600
getting it right I just completely

278
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,740
disagree on the conclusion

279
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,820
so what happens when we want to do

280
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,399
traffic classification on diff serve or

281
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,920
ethernet and we want to do that

282
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,519
independent of uh credits and flow

283
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,700
control

284
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,339
do we reference flow controls as their

285
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,820
base spec

286
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,160
let's say I want to do flow

287
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,079
classification and do different metrics

288
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,240
you know

289
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,579
do I say okay in that document I have to

290
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,279
reference the traffic the credit

291
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,779
extension I'm not going to want to do

292
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,980
credit extension I want to do craft

293
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,579
classification

294
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,420
now if you want to reduce the number of

295
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,860
documents

296
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,779
you can put this in one

297
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,100
if you want to reduce the number of

298
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,079
documents we can rearrange so the top

299
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,220
two are together

300
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,540
that's easy

301
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,399
but if we think about why we have

302
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,440
different documents

303
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,839
it was flow control and traffic

304
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,060
classification or two fundamental

305
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,620
building blocks so we had those in two

306
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,000
different documents

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,820
and then we wanted to allow for

308
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,880
conformance based on rnrfc

309
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,199
so those are the reason we have two

310
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,600
different bottom documents is so that if

311
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,639
you quoted an RFC

312
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,399
you knew what you were getting

313
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,680
so the tops were building block the

314
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,360
bottom were conformance

315
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,160
we can do this in one document we can do

316
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,019
it in four we can do it six we can do it

317
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:28,860
in three

318
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,180
let's just decide move on

319
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,040
Rick Taylor again yeah

320
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,899
Lou just made a really convincing

321
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,019
argument I I jumped too soon

322
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,740
because I had conflated the diffserv

323
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,720
traffic classification and the flow

324
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,360
credits all as one thing and that was a

325
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,100
mistake so I retract my previous

326
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,500
statement there is

327
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,300
and always have been use cases where

328
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,639
being able to describe a flow

329
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,620
but not necessarily because you can want

330
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,660
to do crediting with it is a useful

331
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,240
property having standard ways of

332
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,760
describing common flow types and you use

333
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,500
the example of a five Tuple six double

334
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,440
or something as a flow type that you

335
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,139
might want to

336
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:20,399
monitometrics for or God forbid even

337
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,339
have some kind of flow up flow down in

338
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,600
the equivalent of a destination our

339
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,519
destination down means you don't have to

340
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,779
touch that because we know what a flow

341
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:28,560
is

342
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,579
so I am reversing my opinion and I and I

343
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,440
feel no shame

344
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,459
that's really bad

345
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,320
I uh yeah

346
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,139
I'm not that convinced that you are ever

347
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,060
going to uh

348
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,940
use this classification

349
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,860
uh thing for anything else than the

350
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,660
best flow control

351
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,079
I

352
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,040
I uh Lou Burger again

353
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,199
um I've had some extra documents waiting

354
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,900
around but I've sort of frankly didn't

355
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,859
want to bring them to the working group

356
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,380
you know because this has taken so many

357
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,480
years that would use traffic

358
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,299
classification separately

359
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,280
um we're gonna have to take this to the

360
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,780
list though because we're going to stay

361
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,220
at the schedule we don't have the time

362
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,780
can we make a call now and stick with it

363
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,480
please

364
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,220
and frankly I'll live with whatever you

365
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,400
say

366
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,000
okay I wasn't aware that there was more

367
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,559
coming um

368
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,840
so then then we stick with the current

369
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,740
arrangement

370
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,520
um

371
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,700
is my opinion but I'm only the chair and

372
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,460
the the decision should be one of the

373
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,880
working group

374
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,500
can we just make a decision whatever it

375
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,320
is I I'm perfectly fine taking your

376
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,660
decision as chair and and Running With

377
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,740
It Whatever It Is

378
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,460
I guess we'll look for the answer on the

379
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,200
list and the hearing no change we'll

380
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,820
keep it the way it is

381
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,260
exactly thank you

382
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,600
thanks for the time

383
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,120
so the other thing we have to uh

384
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,820
quickly go over is this uh these

385
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,059
individual Phi related graphs there are

386
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,160
three of them that were written by any

387
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,740
Roca nothing has happened with them for

388
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,660
a long time

389
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,799
um

390
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,440
there was a group adoption call

391
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,919
in March

392
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,120
on one of the three

393
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,100
which I thought at the time was the the

394
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,178
least controversial

395
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,200
um there have been some technical

396
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
comments

397
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,760
um

398
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,660
some of them were addressed although

399
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,820
um but there was no real expression of

400
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,460
support or or non-support of these

401
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,039
trusts what I propose to do

402
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,380
and what Dom already suggested back in

403
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,799
March is to do a adoption call for each

404
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,140
of these three individual adopting calls

405
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,160
uh quickly

406
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,640
and then I uh I do hope to

407
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,700
to get some uh replies

408
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,700
and uh keep in mind that these are only

409
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,320
adoption calls

410
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,780
it's only for the working group to say

411
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,700
we find this interesting and we start

412
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,500
working on them it's these are not

413
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,780
working group law schools they can

414
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,780
have considerable changes uh

415
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,220
while they are working group documents

416
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,380
so I will do that on the list

417
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,860
next on the agenda was a quick uh

418
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,600
follow-up

419
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,820
of the

420
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,100
session that we had in Philadelphia

421
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,940
um

422
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,220
which was a joint session of the Bible

423
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,460
role m a working groups

424
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,600
um

425
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,539
where we presented and the subject was

426
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:22,679
multicast

427
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,799
and we presented uh

428
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:30,179
to each other what we are doing

429
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,400
or multicast to see if there were

430
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,679
overlaps or

431
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,179
um

432
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,340
whether we could

433
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,880
work together or use each other's ideas

434
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,480
these are only a few of my takeaways

435
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,020
if other people have

436
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,080
come away from that meeting with uh

437
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,980
different conclusions or so then uh

438
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,940
feel free to

439
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,980
to go to the mic and and say something

440
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,679
about that there seemed to be some

441
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,039
confusion about the packet detection by

442
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,799
the the non-money participants

443
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,418
who thought that we were just

444
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,320
um

445
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,740
throwing away a package even if they

446
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,720
were

447
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,840
genuine uh

448
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,200
generally identical packets from from

449
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,539
the same Source this is not the case

450
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,820
there's always something

451
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,720
around these packets that is used as a

452
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,700
Criterion for

453
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,159
um

454
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,940
detection and the experimental SMF RC

455
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,500
6621 in section 6

456
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,659
describes how it works so for instance

457
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,600
for IPv6 you can use a

458
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,720
an extension header

459
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,020
to distinguish uh

460
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,600
package from each other

461
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,760
and only if it's a

462
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,539
duplicate that is the result of the same

463
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,440
packet arriving at the same note again

464
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,480
after being retransmitted

465
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,340
several times perhaps

466
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,658
then it's discarded

467
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,860
um

468
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,820
presentation on data plane

469
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,440
implementation aspects which was

470
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,380
interesting and which I personally

471
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,280
would want to work on in my day job

472
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,299
um

473
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,880
but I don't think there was any uh

474
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,240
protocol action behind that

475
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,400
that the iitf is is concerned with

476
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,059
um

477
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,760
and then there was uh there were the

478
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,120
presentations on beer

479
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,520
which is an interesting uh multicasting

480
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,460
technique that we should explore further

481
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,580
to really understand if it's applicable

482
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,220
to manage or not

483
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,539
uh

484
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,580
uh David one Parker

485
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,360
has begun work on a document

486
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,860
um

487
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,620
on use cases and and GAP analysis and

488
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,640
the sort of problem statement around

489
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,480
the use of beer over uh

490
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,659
layer 2 multicast

491
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,720
um

492
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,419
it's it's in a very early stage he did

493
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:37,380
not want to present uh as yet

494
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,700
um

495
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:45,320
but go read it and a comment uh

496
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,860
if you can

497
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,320
I haven't really asked him whether he

498
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,059
wanted the discussion to take place on

499
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,200
the Monet list or on the BLS but I will

500
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,020
and he is in the in the session

501
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,679
at this moment remotely so maybe he can

502
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,039
comment on that

503
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,120
another point that was made by Lou and

504
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,620
Rick I think

505
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,340
is that uh with respect to North Coast

506
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,260
we should look further than the minute

507
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,640
alone but

508
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,919
also uh take into consideration the

509
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,200
money in its is in this environment with

510
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,679
possible one or uh multiple gateways to

511
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,260
the outside world to

512
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,460
infrastructure-based Networks

513
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,860
and see how we can handle that and I

514
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,919
think that's uh that's a fair point

515
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,659
um

516
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,539
and

517
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,539
It's relatively easy I think if you have

518
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,760
only one Gateway but if you have

519
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,860
multiple gateways there's always the

520
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,320
risk that uh

521
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,440
multicast packets that leave your money

522
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,840
through one Gateway come back via

523
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,340
another Gateway and that's something

524
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,080
that you would want to prevent

525
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,840
so these are techniques that we

526
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,440
could potentially work on

527
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,679
under the flag of a new Charter

528
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,700
that's coming later

529
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,380
and at this point

530
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,640
I would like to

531
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,100
go to the

532
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,418
presentation of Sarah

533
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,940
I just have a question about your

534
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,840
um The Joint session did

535
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,720
did you guys and the other chairs sort

536
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,220
of get together afterwards see if there

537
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,580
was something common that could be done

538
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,400
um no unfortunately no no unfortunately

539
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,380
not we should have done that okay can

540
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,539
you and you made you made uh

541
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,260
a statement at the end of that session

542
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,659
that it should not be a one-off and it

543
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,059
should be more uh course fertilization

544
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,880
and uh you were absolutely right but it

545
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,000
did not happen so right um uh of course

546
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,700
I was right I was just saying because uh

547
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,620
and you had that last item there that

548
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,080
maybe there might be a charter item for

549
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,120
this working group now that interaction

550
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,320
of course with the rest of the world

551
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,700
yeah

552
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,860
you know it's sort of obvious in a

553
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,020
ripple Network or a bevel Network or

554
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,240
whatever so there might be some common

555
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,980
things there

556
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,840
um can I give you guys the action to go

557
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,299
check with the other chairs and see if

558
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,039
there's anything

559
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,120
um you don't have to come back with

560
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,600
something that at least you know talk

561
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,580
and I understand and you know this dude

562
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,539
uh label is concluding yes so it would

563
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,080
mostly be a bit rolled then

564
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,320
sure yes please yes

565
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,159
foreign

566
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,820
hi everyone my name is Sarah heiner and

567
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,980
I'm going to be presenting on the dtn

568
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,919
management architecture or dtnma

569
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,080
um I owe anyone who is in the dtn

570
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,240
working group um just a session ago an

571
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,260
apology for presenting the same slides

572
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,299
but we'll see if we can keep it a little

573
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:29,580
bit different a little bit interesting

574
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,480
next slide please

575
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,320
so in this presentation I want to cover

576
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,779
some of the highlights of the DT anime

577
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,360
I'm definitely not going to try to cover

578
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,179
the entire document but it is posted

579
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,419
online version three is the most

580
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,539
up-to-date if you want to look at that

581
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,820
um but we'll be talking through the

582
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,279
problem space and some considerations

583
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,320
that we had from existing Network

584
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,659
management protocols and then talk

585
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,980
through the reference and autonomy model

586
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,820
excellent

587
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,980
so as a really quick introduction to the

588
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,179
dtnma

589
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,400
um we originally called it the AMA

590
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,080
that's the asynchronous management

591
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,760
architecture

592
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,100
um well we decided that asynchronous was

593
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,140
not the right word to describe the

594
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,419
problem space that we were working in so

595
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,880
for now sticking with the DT anime

596
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,500
instead

597
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,559
and at a really high level summary the

598
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,799
dtnma is looking to address three key

599
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,159
points so this management architecture

600
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,220
has to work in a scenario where a

601
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,580
managed and managing device are not

602
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,860
always connected they're dealing with

603
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,740
asynchronous behavior

604
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,860
um we need an autonomy model of sorts to

605
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,220
enable self-management of those managed

606
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,659
devices

607
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:00,600
and then we need to use compact

608
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,779
encodings which is enabled by the naming

609
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,059
structures that we've chosen to address

610
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:10,820
some of the constraints in that Network

611
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,559
so one of the first sections that we

612
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,980
added to this document was in an effort

613
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,000
to Define our problem space better

614
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,659
so we acknowledge that a dtn can be

615
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:30,779
considered a constrained Network which

616
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,779
is why we need to make sure that the

617
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,240
encodings that we are using are

618
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,080
efficient and a GTM is also a challenge

619
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,559
Network so experiencing issues like

620
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,440
disruptions and delays which is where

621
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,260
the focus on autonomy and handling

622
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,500
asynchronous Behavior comes from

623
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,100
looks like

624
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,440
after we established that problem space

625
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,779
we wanted to take a look at the work

626
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,820
that had already been done in this area

627
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,580
and see what we could learn from what we

628
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,380
could draw from and how that could be

629
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,840
incorporated into the dtnma

630
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,080
so as we looked at some of the existing

631
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,659
approaches we saw both Lessons Learned

632
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,140
to bring in and gaps that we felt needed

633
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,299
to be filled by the dtnma

634
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,580
so for example when we took a look at

635
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,899
SNMP and netconf it was appreciated that

636
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:31,500
that is a well-structured approach but

637
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,140
it requires the establishment of a low

638
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,059
latency session which is something that

639
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:38,880
we can't guarantee when operating in a

640
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,860
dtn

641
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,440
um similar to ruscomf we appreciate that

642
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,960
that is stateless but it requires the

643
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,860
use of https and typically some large

644
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,399
data transfers to move data stores and

645
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:55,679
that's also not something that we can

646
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,380
expect to always be able to support in a

647
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,120
dtn

648
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,279
um and then third point to address here

649
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,039
is we took a look at core conf which

650
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,700
uses seaboor to enable

651
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,340
more efficient encodings but was still

652
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,440
missing some of the pieces that we were

653
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,059
looking for

654
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:18,960
so on the next slide please

655
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,260
so I tried to put a visualization of

656
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,260
those points into this slide

657
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,059
um and obviously that's a lot of

658
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,340
information to distill into three

659
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,760
circles so don't take this as a complete

660
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,340
representation of the problem space but

661
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,740
trying to figure out a way to show how

662
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,640
the DT anime fits into these three

663
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,279
different areas that are a priority for

664
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,440
that management architecture

665
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,500
so at the top we're prioritizing

666
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,620
autonomy we need to support asynchronous

667
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,260
behavior and then we also need efficient

668
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,620
encodings and there's existing work in

669
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,539
all of these circles but we could not

670
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,120
find an approach that addressed that

671
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,360
intersection which is where the dtnma

672
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,139
fits

673
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,380
so one of the first major updates that

674
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,320
we made to the document was to address

675
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,460
the dtnma reference model

676
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,039
on the left you'll see our original AMA

677
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,500
model but it was very generic in

678
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,799
describing the autonomy that we required

679
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,960
for this network management approach and

680
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,539
because that's one of the focuses of the

681
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,539
dtnma it was important to update the

682
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,700
model and show how we're taking

683
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,340
advantage of the use of an autonomy

684
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,700
engine at the manage device and policy

685
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,659
which is created and passed over by the

686
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:56,279
managing device to inform autonomy

687
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,380
next slide please

688
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,440
and we will get into these figures um a

689
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,700
little bit larger

690
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,460
um after the slide so we will slow down

691
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,740
and talk to those details soon

692
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,500
but in the reference model there are

693
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,080
three main points that I want to address

694
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,940
because they're all important in

695
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,700
enabling device

696
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,380
self-management which is something that

697
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,320
we need if we can't count on a

698
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,799
connection between the managing and

699
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,440
manage device

700
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,200
um first is the use of pre-shared

701
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,620
definitions so in the moments where

702
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,140
these devices are connected we want to

703
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,600
take advantage of that and make sure

704
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,120
that we are sharing the data and models

705
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,799
that are needed so that there's an

706
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:47,100
agreed upon definition of the data that

707
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,760
is being pulled that is reacted to and

708
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,240
what those reactions should look like

709
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,000
second is the notion of self-management

710
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,539
which is happening for the agent which

711
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,720
is residing on that manage device so

712
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,580
again an acknowledgment that that

713
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,820
managed device is often disconnected and

714
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,000
we need some sort of local autonomy to

715
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,060
react to the occurrence of events but we

716
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,280
need those reactions to be consistent

717
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,320
and based off of information that's

718
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,800
provided by the managing device

719
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,440
and then the third component that's

720
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
represented here is the use of

721
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,599
command-based management so because we

722
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,480
can't support bulk updates and the use

723
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,739
of large data stores like you might with

724
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:41,520
a netcomf approach we're instead using a

725
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,760
command and control interface to allow

726
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,339
that managing device to get information

727
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:50,000
to the manage device

728
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,339
to include the policy statements that

729
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:57,060
are configuring that autonomy engine

730
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,960
next slide

731
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,359
so now getting into the details of this

732
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,339
reference model we're going to start at

733
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,920
the bottom which are the pre-shared

734
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,820
definitions so again this is occurring

735
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,040
in a challenged environment the

736
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,859
real-time data negotiation that you

737
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,920
would need to maintain large data stores

738
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,000
is not a guarantee so instead we are

739
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,119
taking advantage of when the managing

740
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,700
and manage device can speak to each

741
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,320
other to

742
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,700
update an autonomy model

743
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,640
adms which are application data models

744
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,400
um those contain agreed upon data

745
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,460
definitions and are something that we

746
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,160
can standardize so that that can be

747
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,740
shared across the network and then also

748
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,740
runtime data stores

749
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,220
next slide

750
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,880
and then speaking to the managing device

751
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,099
we'll start at the top with the

752
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:04,680
applications and services that live on

753
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,220
the managing device these are the source

754
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,760
for policy statements and they're also

755
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,140
the target of the managed devices

756
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,099
reports information that is coming back

757
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,579
um and those applications and services

758
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:25,320
may have an operator in the loop but

759
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,119
they also may not

760
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,119
slide

761
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,720
however the information is coming from

762
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,480
those application and services

763
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,599
um one of the key pieces of information

764
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,380
is the policy statements um which are

765
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:51,000
then received by the dtnma manager that

766
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,940
policy is then encoded and sent to the

767
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,940
dtnma agent to act on

768
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,440
so um we are translating policy into a

769
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,119
standard expression that can be

770
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,920
understood

771
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,520
um

772
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,640
and in addition to being that interface

773
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,859
between those applications and services

774
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:14,640
on the managing device the manager is

775
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,520
also receiving reports back from the

776
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,359
managed devices that map to it and then

777
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,839
is Distributing that information to the

778
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:28,320
requesting applications and services

779
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,359
and then we've also included some

780
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,780
administrative configuration that has to

781
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,480
live here so keeping track of for

782
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,880
example mapping two different managed

783
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,540
devices

784
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,400
there are also applications and services

785
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,700
that reside at the manage device

786
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,680
um actually in the last iteration of

787
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,060
this presentation it was pointed out

788
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,040
that it would be helpful to know that

789
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,320
these are not the same applications and

790
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,339
services that are at the managing device

791
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:05,700
um these applications and services are

792
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,000
being monitored by the agent these are

793
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,280
what are managed

794
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,599
um and they contain State information

795
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,980
that is sampled

796
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,579
um their configuration can be changed by

797
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:23,820
the DT anime agent and their behavior

798
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,700
can also be influenced by the dtnma

799
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,098
agent all through the use of controls

800
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,320
and then finally getting into the actual

801
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,079
agent residing on the manage device

802
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,320
so the agent is responsible for carrying

803
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,560
out monitoring and control and the

804
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,420
compelling piece of that is it needs to

805
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,280
do that without a regular connection

806
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,240
back to the managing device so the agent

807
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,480
itself is able to determine what state

808
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,880
it needs to pull and when

809
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,119
um and part of that is driven by the

810
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,640
internal autonomy model

811
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,579
so there are rules that populate that

812
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,720
autonomy engine that tell the dtnma

813
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,660
agent what pieces of State information

814
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,060
it should be monitoring and how it

815
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,540
should react to changes in state

816
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,359
the agent is also responsible for data

817
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,520
Fusion so creating

818
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,119
um

819
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,780
new data or reports to then be sent back

820
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,140
to the managing device and then again

821
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,260
some administrative points here like

822
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,579
maintaining

823
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:43,220
um mappings back to the managers

824
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,020
the last part that I want to address

825
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,700
here is the dtnma autonomy model so this

826
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,619
is what is allowing the manager to

827
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:02,700
provide policy to the dtnma agent and

828
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,400
the agent to act on that policy to be

829
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,980
able to manage itself when it's not

830
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,619
connected to that manager

831
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,560
so at the top of this model you'll see

832
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,440
that the manager is providing policy

833
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,220
Expressions to the agent to populate a

834
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,960
local rule database

835
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,500
so those roles are saying if this

836
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,079
stimulus event occurs respond in this

837
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,380
standard way

838
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,500
next slide

839
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,619
so then getting into those responses

840
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:43,380
that can be carried out as the dtnma

841
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,359
agent is receiving

842
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,960
data from those applications that it is

843
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,760
managing

844
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,660
um the autonomy engine is reacting to

845
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,720
events and that could look like sending

846
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,140
a control to that application to

847
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,440
influence its state or configuration in

848
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,000
some way

849
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,660
um

850
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,020
the autonomy engine might also instruct

851
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,339
the agent to instead generate a report

852
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:17,520
and send that back to the manager and it

853
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,400
can also influence the runtime data

854
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,000
store which can be updated as well by

855
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,140
the dtnma manager with additional data

856
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,900
definitions when connectivity is

857
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,560
established

858
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,400
so with that I know that I ran through

859
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,579
all of that really quickly so if there

860
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,599
are any clarifying questions

861
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,560
thank you

862
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,000
all right luberger I'm just trying to

863
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,260
understand the relationship between what

864
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,480
you presented and what you had earlier

865
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,300
and you talked about

866
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,400
um uh Co-op or Cody whatever you want to

867
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,579
call it work off rescoff anima

868
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:00,900
um and then he went into this and then

869
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,920
you uh so rescoff and and corkov are

870
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,200
ways to transport Yang models basically

871
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,900
to encode and transport EA models is

872
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,220
what you're talking about here is an

873
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,260
alternate way to encode and transport

874
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,760
Yang models or

875
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,040
something completely different

876
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,579
um

877
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,820
completely different in that we can't

878
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,940
in the environment of this constrained

879
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,760
and challenged Network we haven't seen

880
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,700
how we could support the use of a Yang

881
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,740
module for the configuration and control

882
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,740
of data so looking for an alternative

883
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,540
that is not using necessarily that

884
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,940
schema so that we can address the

885
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,579
intersection of those three circles

886
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,260
um Yang is a way of modeling information

887
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,660
and

888
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,220
um to some degree also modeling

889
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,779
transactions related to that information

890
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,760
for ways of sort of transporting it it

891
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,440
seems to me that you need a new way of

892
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,480
transporting to handle your disconnected

893
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,099
operation but you don't necessarily need

894
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:15,060
a new language for modeling of

895
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,060
management information no I absolutely

896
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,079
agree

897
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:22,140
um I I misunderstood but yes definitely

898
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,020
I'm sure it wasn't clear I I

899
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,180
agree that

900
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,020
um

901
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,660
we should be looking at what can we pull

902
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,900
from what is existing that we can

903
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,099
incorporate

904
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,740
um something that we're looking at in

905
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,900
representing this data is we want it to

906
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,020
be hierarchical in nature we want to

907
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,200
make sure that we're considering

908
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,900
the efficiency of the encoding to make

909
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,160
sure that we're not creating something

910
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,560
that's so large that it doesn't have a

911
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,599
chance of making it to that managed

912
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,339
device okay well when you talk about

913
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,140
policy there's a lot of Yang models that

914
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,819
are looking already at policy so there

915
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:01,560
just might be work you can build on and

916
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,480
keep in mind Yang is not about encoding

917
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,980
it is not about transport it's about

918
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,200
modeling the information and then you

919
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,300
can encode it as appropriate using the

920
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,480
most efficient again core conf or the

921
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,800
least efficient whichever one you think

922
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,540
is I personally don't like XML but

923
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,400
that's my bias

924
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,220
um uh so

925
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,400
um it just it'd be good to leverage that

926
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,220
other work and add to it by adding

927
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,079
encoding and transport as necessary and

928
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,640
maybe you don't even need a new encoding

929
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,839
maybe you only need new transport

930
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,400
okay uh that brain so I just wanted to

931
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,619
uh come in and

932
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,000
um you know sort of agree with what uh

933
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,560
Sarah was saying uh and also what Lou

934
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,619
was saying uh in that

935
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,260
part of the interest in the work is

936
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,240
trying to suss out

937
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,740
what is the useful autonomy model that

938
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,560
should exist on a perhaps very resource

939
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,260
constrained device that has to manage

940
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,819
itself

941
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:05,339
um in a challenged environment

942
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:09,480
uh and that set of

943
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,079
um behaviors variables data models that

944
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,440
language is probably a subset of all

945
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,960
that could be modeled in Yang but also

946
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,900
that there is some sort of useful local

947
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,540
constructs and I'll use the word Loosely

948
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,940
that that we have added with what we

949
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,280
call part of our syntactic sugar to help

950
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,800
reduce you know round trips that even

951
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,240
though Yang is separate from an

952
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,440
underlying

953
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,099
um

954
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:39,960
transport although at the time you know

955
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,339
it was created it was you know kind of

956
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,680
focused on on netconf there are some

957
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,319
things that you can represent by adding

958
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,880
additional parameters or additional

959
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,920
metadata if you were to construct those

960
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,319
models if you have

961
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,200
a standard definition of your autonomy

962
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,020
data model so and then you represent

963
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,000
that in a Yang module you can do that

964
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,619
and we have people who have done that

965
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:04,440
and we also have folks who have done net

966
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,339
conf to DT anime Bridges and shown how

967
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:10,560
you can go back and forth between Yang

968
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,800
models and other representations of it

969
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,119
so just a few comments

970
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,000
just one

971
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,700
comment for me to one of the early early

972
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,520
slides of your presentation is that I

973
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,800
consider um most money is also

974
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,420
constrained and challenged

975
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:40,740
different areas and that's something

976
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,440
that we certainly found even in um just

977
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,560
using the word asynchronous initially to

978
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,319
describe our management architecture is

979
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:51,599
um we ought to not limit

980
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,180
where we can apply things

981
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,339
always best to seek them the largest

982
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:57,900
audience

983
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,700
thank you and thanks very much for your

984
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,060
presentation

985
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,319
and I've got one remaining slide

986
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:08,760
um so we probably will have to continue

987
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,359
this on the mailing list anyway

988
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:14,480
um

989
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,780
I um

990
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,300
I think we as chairs receive some an

991
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,660
email from uh overall uh

992
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,079
maybe two months back or something

993
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,119
um

994
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,859
about the fact that we were

995
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,119
okay

996
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,160
to get straight to the point there was

997
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,940
some talk about a bubble uh closing down

998
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,520
and uh

999
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,220
I think there was an idea within the

1000
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,960
Bible working group

1001
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,880
um to

1002
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,880
do any remaining work that there might

1003
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,740
be

1004
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:00,359
uh from within the money group

1005
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:03,660
and unfortunately I I did not respond uh

1006
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:07,260
at that time uh that was first

1007
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,359
I was aware that this was coming and

1008
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,460
then uh

1009
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,300
this is also reached the overall and uh

1010
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,579
he said something like now now the cat

1011
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:20,220
is out of the back uh let's let's

1012
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,319
discuss this and then let's also think

1013
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,440
about the retartering

1014
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,119
um

1015
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,160
so I started thinking about uh

1016
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,800
what what we uh what we

1017
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,040
could do I looked at the current Charter

1018
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,020
most of you are familiar with what's in

1019
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,180
there this uh

1020
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,000
Samoans are maintenance that we're

1021
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,400
supposed to do there's d-lab which was

1022
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,359
done

1023
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,460
deal at flow control which is hopefully

1024
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,460
almost uh especially the the the the

1025
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,880
credit based variety of that is almost

1026
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,440
done

1027
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,420
then there was a

1028
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,940
dealer traffic classification statistics

1029
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,400
which made me wonder what it was but now

1030
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,420
I I think that it may be one of these

1031
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,359
things that uh

1032
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:20,760
Lou or don't maybe have planned for uh

1033
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,839
as a follow-up to uh as a an additional

1034
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:27,619
use of the perfect classification uh

1035
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:33,020
draft or RFC as it becomes that

1036
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,140
um

1037
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,680
multicast we of course addressed in the

1038
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,480
uh The Joint session with roll and

1039
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,500
Bobble

1040
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,720
I

1041
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,380
or no sorry let me rephrase it not

1042
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,540
because protocol framework and multicast

1043
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:53,160
FIP was was on the uh current uh Charter

1044
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:58,319
nothing much happened uh on that so far

1045
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,880
um

1046
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,579
and particularly implementing a sip

1047
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:06,599
is is interesting but uh

1048
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:11,040
again uh I I don't see uh any protocol

1049
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,220
development action behind this

1050
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,500
we could think about

1051
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,020
um defining an API

1052
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,099
or

1053
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,220
um

1054
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:24,839
yeah

1055
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,780
I it's not immediately obvious to me

1056
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,480
what what we should do there but if

1057
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,760
anybody has some ideas then I would like

1058
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,079
to hear that

1059
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,819
and then there is the the infamous

1060
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:37,980
documenting challenges best practices

1061
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,240
for deploying and management

1062
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:43,920
yeah

1063
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,099
I think that dtmma has just presented

1064
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:49,740
could play a role there

1065
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,859
um

1066
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,859
oh sorry what did I do

1067
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,020
voicemail.com

1068
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,140
sorry yeah did you read it I I think I

1069
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,540
was trying to remove you from the queue

1070
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,940
oh okay all right

1071
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,940
uh

1072
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:21,380
sorry for that

1073
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,180
um

1074
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,460
so this this uh best practices for

1075
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,859
deploying uh your I think I don't think

1076
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:33,780
you will ever get that information

1077
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,599
but uh yeah

1078
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:41,180
so that that has been on the uh

1079
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,859
on the charter since the last three

1080
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:46,440
Charter in 2016 and nothing much just

1081
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,900
happened there

1082
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,200
um so if we are going to recharger uh

1083
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,579
you know first of all there is the

1084
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:56,700
question is there anything anybody

1085
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,859
who still has energy to work on anything

1086
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:00,900
in this working group

1087
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,359
I know I would want to work on multicast

1088
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,960
um

1089
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,780
but overall do you want to say something

1090
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,220
now

1091
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,399
foreign

1092
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,660
so just some general comments

1093
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,720
um one is that I think the working group

1094
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,380
was actually mature in some cases

1095
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,780
um so what I would like to see is for

1096
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,520
example it says they're always hard to

1097
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,500
be to maintenance you know similar

1098
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,660
statements for dlap so instead of

1099
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,900
listing the 10 next extensions or the

1100
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,040
three Nexus stations that we're going to

1101
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,240
have you know leave it up to the left

1102
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,859
maintenance and extension period that's

1103
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:45,839
it right that way we don't need to be

1104
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,520
recharging every three months or

1105
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,900
anything like that

1106
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,559
um

1107
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:52,680
also our dlab

1108
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,780
um you know the the sort of thought

1109
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,200
about Babel for me is that uh you know

1110
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,480
it's a shame that if the working group

1111
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,520
closes and there are enhancements to the

1112
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,160
protocol uh I see Julius on the on the

1113
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,599
line there

1114
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,280
um that there might be not not a place

1115
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,319
to work on it uh by default in the

1116
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,619
routing area uh rcwg takes everything

1117
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:16,740
that doesn't have a home right

1118
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,680
um yeah

1119
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,720
but in this case I feel that there's

1120
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,160
probably better

1121
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,680
uh expertise or closer expertise to

1122
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,200
Babel I honestly don't know how many of

1123
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,579
you participated in the Bible working

1124
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:32,099
group but you know ideally

1125
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:32,760
um

1126
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,280
and again I see Julius Santo Q there you

1127
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,480
know they would come here too right

1128
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,819
especially if there is something else

1129
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:41,460
that needs to be worked so that way we

1130
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,059
give it a home right so not necessarily

1131
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:47,520
um you know the same as with osrv2 kind

1132
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,960
of listening there battle maintenance

1133
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,119
type thing

1134
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:51,960
um

1135
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,359
and and the other comment that I have is

1136
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,579
uh the tnma

1137
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:59,819
I I really don't want to see a dtnma for

1138
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,440
money

1139
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,599
what I want to see

1140
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,020
is what's the charter of the TN working

1141
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,319
group which is

1142
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:14,280
dtnma where they work with us

1143
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,900
or in other words we work with them

1144
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,780
right so the wording there should be yes

1145
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,220
we're going to work on maintenance and

1146
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,720
we're going to leverage and collaborate

1147
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,500
with the dtn working group on their dtma

1148
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,579
um

1149
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:28,859
framework or whatever the you copy the

1150
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:31,740
whatever the the 10 uh

1151
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,939
turtle races

1152
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:37,500
that I guess at a high level right those

1153
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,319
are the the maintenance

1154
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,859
and the specific management item that we

1155
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:46,680
already have work on right

1156
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,119
um and then sure we need to figure out

1157
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:51,599
what if anything we're going to do with

1158
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,599
uh multicast

1159
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,460
um we're probably not going to get that

1160
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,520
documental deployment but you know we'll

1161
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,660
see what happens when we take the

1162
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,280
charter to the AEG if people want to

1163
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,660
keep it in there or you know what do we

1164
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,740
do

1165
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,240
um

1166
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,839
um what I would then want to do

1167
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:11,760
is and of course you're the chairs you

1168
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,619
do whatever you want but what I would do

1169
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:16,140
is

1170
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,140
um

1171
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,740
given that we're going to have a new

1172
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,079
Charter with new energy

1173
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,240
you know try and focus the work right

1174
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,000
and get the work moving

1175
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,480
um we've been reviewing these d-lab

1176
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,339
drafts forever yeah

1177
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:34,020
um not that when they fall into my key

1178
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,940
or do you mean the faster but still you

1179
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,280
know we need to to get stuff out so

1180
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,200
let's try and find a way we can talk

1181
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,380
offline later on how to move the the

1182
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,240
work forward

1183
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,640
um yeah so just general comments thanks

1184
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,220
uh we have only um

1185
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,559
five minutes left can you be very brief

1186
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:57,839
because I would really like to hear what

1187
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,920
uh Julius has to say

1188
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,359
okay uh that's uh regarding uh the

1189
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:10,619
rooting product that multicast I think

1190
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:13,700
uh still there is room for uh

1191
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,579
or re-chartering we mentioned this uh

1192
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:21,540
the multicast routing is important for

1193
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:25,740
this group and we haven't discussed much

1194
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,500
about multicast

1195
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,099
or ad hoc multicast

1196
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:34,619
thank you

1197
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:37,220
yes and if you have any ideas

1198
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,020
on this please post them on the mailing

1199
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,980
list

1200
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,819
Julius

1201
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,660
[Music]

1202
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,420
hi um yeah just a few words I really

1203
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,819
wish that download were cheers so what

1204
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:52,920
I'm going to say is my opinion and not

1205
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,599
necessarily the opinion of the charity

1206
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:56,720
yeah

1207
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,180
I'm here okay do you allow me to speak

1208
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,180
go

1209
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,420
okay

1210
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,819
um so uh I my feeling is that we're

1211
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:10,380
pretty done with Babel the plan with

1212
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,780
Babel was to close the to standardized

1213
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,700
Babel and a few important extensions and

1214
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,500
to close the working group three years

1215
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,140
ago we ended up doing a lot of fun stuff

1216
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,819
over the last three years that that was

1217
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:23,280
unplanned and I think it is time to

1218
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,200
close the working group now all the

1219
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,059
Registries in Bible or specifications

1220
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,520
required so we don't strictly need a

1221
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,440
working group if we want to do any

1222
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,599
further extensions to Babel

1223
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,500
however uh there is a feeling and Donald

1224
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,020
will correct me if I'm wrong that it

1225
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,000
might be more convenient in some places

1226
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,400
if there were a working group where we

1227
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,220
could publish Babel

1228
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,740
um future Bible work and many is a

1229
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,359
friendly group with people who have all

1230
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,460
the right competence to judge to review

1231
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:57,300
the Bible drafts and that is why I would

1232
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,660
like the charter to add something like

1233
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,180
Babel maintenance so that we can have a

1234
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,119
place to publish draft and rfcs in the

1235
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,240
future

1236
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,780
Rick very quickly my app has crashed

1237
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,460
completely I can't I can't click the

1238
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,599
button anymore

1239
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,579
um very good question really kind of to

1240
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:19,800
the chairs in the ad what's happening

1241
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,859
with aodv2

1242
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:25,020
ah and that's I'm not making a political

1243
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,520
statement no no I haven't answered that

1244
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,680
so uh you guys remember last time we

1245
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,920
recharger this thing uh Charlie asked me

1246
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,940
to a the sponsor lwb2

1247
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,240
so I started reviewing uh I'm still

1248
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,079
waiting for updates and so basically uh

1249
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:45,480
Charlie hasn't had time to work on it uh

1250
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,460
it's still in my queue

1251
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,680
that doesn't mean that I'll keep it like

1252
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,740
you forever I'm I'm about to just uh

1253
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,420
give up because we've been working on it

1254
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,920
for three or four years and we're still

1255
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,880
not done

1256
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,799
uh I don't believe his co-authors have

1257
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,540
heard about it either for about two

1258
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,760
years so

1259
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,260
and then there's a thing called the

1260
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:08,299
audvp Ripple which is different I guess

1261
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,940
yep as one minute left yeah this is

1262
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,559
Donnelly's like again I just uh say

1263
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,839
there is one uh document I'm about to

1264
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:22,140
request publication for uh in Babel and

1265
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,760
there is an expired draft that a number

1266
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,020
of people in battle would like to see

1267
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,700
published but it doesn't really matter

1268
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,559
whether the Bible organ group exists as

1269
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,480
a separate working group uh for any of

1270
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,520
us so uh I think I'd welcome having a

1271
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,500
novel maintenance item in the vanity

1272
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,940
Charter and uh

1273
00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:45,599
yes thank you

1274
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,780
the the reason that I was was still

1275
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,760
Milling over my response to that was

1276
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,440
that um

1277
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,440
I was afraid that Monet would also be

1278
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,839
going the way of the dodo soon

1279
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,740
and then I would still end up in uh

1280
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:06,680
enrouting uh rooting area working group

1281
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,799
okay we're officially out of time now

1282
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,500
so thanks everyone for your

1283
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,180
contributions

1284
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,400
just one thing

1285
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,900
to avoid money going the way of the dodo

1286
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,319
we need work right so we need to come to

1287
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:27,359
the meetings get the work done push the

1288
