1
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,800
so we are at time I'm going to give it

2
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,480
another minute or two just because after

3
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,280
lunch everybody trails in and we have

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,780
plenty of time today so I'm not too

5
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,500
worried about the time

6
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,159
okay let's go ahead and get started this

7
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,259
is the secure asset transfer protocol

8
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,820
buff

9
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,119
my name is Wes hardiker and

10
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,140
um

11
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,939
we are we have a there's a mailing list

12
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,040
it's actually sat not sat P just in case

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,719
anybody wants to try and join it

14
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,819
uh this is the introduction we're going

15
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,099
to go through a few things first of

16
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,440
course thank you to Dennis who agreed to

17
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,180
take notes I would love it if somebody

18
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,980
else would help him out because it's

19
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,560
always a hard job the the note taking

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,140
link inside the agenda makes it very

21
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,020
very easy to take notes so please help

22
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,520
them out if you're able

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
uh we'll have four sort of major

24
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,000
sections for the the information

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,459
presentation for today uh there will be

26
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:36,720
you know one just about the problem

27
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,379
space and goals by Thomas

28
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,420
kind of describe the use case with

29
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,400
supply chain trade and then there'll be

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,500
another use case with regulated uh

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,780
Finance sort of transactions that the

32
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,640
proponents believe this was a good use

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
case for

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,300
and then we'll have a status report on

35
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,980
sort of what's happening if we had a

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,500
buff at our ETF 114 and the proponents

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,120
uh took a lot of the advice that came

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,580
from the room found it very helpful

39
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,540
they've been meeting frequently talking

40
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,280
frequently and I've talked to them as

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,599
well some

42
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,700
um so we'll have we'll get some updates

43
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,280
on what has been done since 114.

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,659
and then finally there's a lot of time

45
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,459
for open discussion for the problem

46
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,560
space and proposed starting Solutions I

47
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
do want to hold the questions to sort of

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,640
clarifying questions first

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,900
um and then we'll actually have the open

50
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,519
discussion about you know the typical

51
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,459
questions of uh is this a the what's the

52
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,319
right outcome for the spot

53
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,940
um but so for the the middle part just

54
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,680
please ask clarifying questions which

55
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
I'll reiterate as time goes on

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,300
I'm sure most of you are well familiar

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,860
with the note well since this is now

58
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,200
midday Thursday and we're not too far

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,239
from the end of the conference uh if you

60
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,519
don't know it anything you contribute uh

61
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,739
will be used and recorded and that's

62
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,780
part of the record so

63
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,120
uh there's a list of BCPS that will help

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,799
you understand things that include IPS

65
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,540
and working group processes and

66
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,159
copyrights and all that type of stuff

67
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,280
Please be aware of it

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,599
remember that we do have a code of

69
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,459
conduct guidelines that includes wearing

70
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,680
a mask we'll see what happens at the end

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,659
of this meeting but during this meeting

72
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,360
we have all agreed by consensus to wear

73
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,120
masks so please everybody do wear a mask

74
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,879
the entire time you can see that I'm

75
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,380
speaking even with it you can probably

76
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,820
hear me pretty well so you can actually

77
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,798
use one at a microphone but you're

78
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,478
you're allowed to take it off at a

79
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,220
microphone if you need be if you're up

80
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,400
front

81
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,440
reminder the session is being recorded

82
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,360
um so both in person and remote

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,940
participants will be recorded uh the the

84
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,340
buff will be posted on YouTube like the

85
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,900
last one was so make sure that you you

86
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,799
are aware of that

87
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,139
the important takeaways for this buff

88
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,419
are is this a problem that needs to be

89
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,520
solving is the ietf the right place for

90
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,620
it are there enough participants that

91
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,540
are willing and able to help in terms of

92
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,160
both reviewing and editing and all that

93
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,960
type of stuff is the scope well defined

94
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
are the deliverables and the output puts

95
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,460
expected to be correct and is the

96
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,100
working group likely to succeed

97
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,380
we'll come back to those questions so

98
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,380
we're going to start now with the

99
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,540
problem and proposed starting solution

100
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,060
section which will start with Thomas and

101
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,000
the set P problem space and goals

102
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,020
can people hear me okay

103
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,720
get a little closer a little closer okay

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,000
um okay and um

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,860
Waze is going to yeah run this place

106
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,820
thank you

107
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
um yeah so yeah so

108
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,919
sorry

109
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,039
um yeah so so some of you who attended

110
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,220
the Philly ietf might recognize a couple

111
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,419
of these slides I'm just going to go

112
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,520
through and recap some of the

113
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,860
presentations and the inputs the good

114
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,400
inputs we received in Philadelphia and

115
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
you know we've Incorporated those inputs

116
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,479
pretty much every one of them and made

117
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,720
us we rethink rewrite some of the slides

118
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,280
because I think some of the some of the

119
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,259
words were not conveying what you know

120
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,639
what we meant to say

121
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,240
next slide please

122
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,000
uh so so this is probably you know I put

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,060
this in just to clarify that that you

124
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,860
know we have a growing number of digital

125
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,320
asset networks they all run on the

126
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,320
internet uh many of the uh next

127
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,360
generation of developers may not even

128
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,639
realize that many of the you know

129
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,740
features and protocols actually run over

130
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,100
iitf rfcs right ifs standards so

131
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,840
um

132
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,880
this um this fact that that this is just

133
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,440
a large growth and there's a lot of

134
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,259
proprietary stuff out there introduces a

135
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:38,699
number of interesting security

136
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,220
challenges and of course data privacy

137
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,919
challenges uh and you know my solution

138
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,479
to this as well you know go back to the

139
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,000
ITF and you know do what the ITF is is

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,360
best doing namely producing written

141
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
technical standards and and and goal is

142
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,360
for interoperability of these Networks

143
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,539
uh next slide am I am I speaking loud

144
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,520
enough for people online

145
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,580
so so uh when we say Network

146
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,979
interoperability the goal really is to

147
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,919
move across a digital asset and there's

148
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,479
a definition of a digital asset is

149
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,960
across from one network to another

150
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,280
satisfying certain conditions such as

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,500
you know atomicity consistency and so on

152
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,840
today what we're seeing in the industry

153
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,940
is that people are doing just bilateral

154
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,539
agreements and to me this this is like

155
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,000
the mid 90s when we have multiple isps

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,860
and isps you should do you know

157
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,380
bilateral peering agreements it's almost

158
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,720
like that today and there are a number

159
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,180
of other you know proprietary transfer

160
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,160
protocols that they're being used but

161
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,979
again it's only for bilateral

162
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,240
connections so

163
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,419
really this is kind of a lack of written

164
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,580
standards that financial institutions

165
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,400
and other organizations can point to and

166
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,280
mandate compliance of implementations

167
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,240
the lack of those standards are

168
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,680
inhibiting the industry it's like well

169
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,660
you know we don't want to enter Because

170
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,940
if something goes wrong we lose money we

171
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,400
lose assets you know let's just wait and

172
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,319
I think this is a great opportunity for

173
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,780
the ITF as a Community to actually

174
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,460
contribute you know to the world

175
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,900
particularly in in the context of

176
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,699
interop

177
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,560
next slide next

178
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,800
so this is from Philly Philadelphia so

179
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,580
so where there's so many types and kinds

180
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,319
of digital assets so we're using the

181
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,020
term value-bearing data objects so you

182
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,120
have a value-bearing data object in one

183
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,219
network and you're trying to move it

184
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,279
across to another Network so that

185
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:39,120
entails uh recreating exact copy on

186
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,979
another Network and deleting or

187
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,120
invalidating

188
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,480
the original copy and so you need this

189
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,720
condition that there can only be one at

190
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,700
any one time and it needs to satisfy the

191
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,980
asset property at atomicity consistency

192
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,800
isolation durability this is your your

193
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,980
database textbook you know and freshman

194
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,620
or Junior textbook

195
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,899
and the transfer must be verifiable by

196
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,000
an authorized third party because it's

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,060
got to be disputes and you need to be

198
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,519
able to bring in an auditor or something

199
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,560
like that that can replay and look at

200
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,540
the traces of the transfer and say yes

201
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,100
you know

202
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,380
did not happen A Fault happen or a bug

203
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,180
happened or somebody was dishonest right

204
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,300
so that's that's a key requirement

205
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,180
next one and so this is um the proposed

206
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,940
scope is the yellow area in the middle

207
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,459
so people ask me all the time what about

208
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,140
the networks well there's just too many

209
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,060
types of networks and new ones are

210
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,399
coming up all the time and to me this is

211
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,740
uh if you're old enough this is the Lan

212
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,740
problem if you guys remember IBM sna

213
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,500
networks and decnet and ethernet you

214
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,680
know who won that battle ethernet but

215
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,360
this is also exactly like interdomain

216
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,500
and intra

217
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,360
domain routing right so what we're

218
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,180
saying in in our language the yellow bit

219
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,640
is is the bgp protocol right are we

220
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,200
going to Define what a router is the

221
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,640
Gateway is not we're not we're not going

222
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,560
to build gateways we don't know how to

223
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,720
build gateways that's that's you know

224
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,760
implement this problem what we're going

225
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,740
to do is Define the interaction between

226
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,240
the gateways and that's that's the

227
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
yellow bit

228
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
um and I think this is this is the best

229
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,860
thing for the industry as a whole

230
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,440
because the industry itself is still

231
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,779
emerging and evolving in new types of

232
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,700
networks are being created right so we

233
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,980
don't want to touch that let the market

234
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,380
decide which type of network wins wins

235
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,540
the day that's fine that's fine with me

236
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,440
but we want to ensure interoperability

237
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,560
across these types of of Networks

238
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,779
thank you so

239
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,720
so this is you know just some some basic

240
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,079
you know assumptions uh for this uh the

241
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,420
yellow bit to run which is

242
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,180
um both that we need to share some

243
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,920
common understanding semantics of the

244
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,200
data objects and and validity what does

245
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,440
valid mean all right so so that's we

246
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,120
assume this exists because we can't

247
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,940
impose this on the networks uh for our

248
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,579
own design print principles we assume

249
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,220
the networks are opaque so you might

250
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,320
hear the word permissioned access

251
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
controlled private those are the terms

252
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,700
that sometimes they use I like to use

253
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,800
the word opaque because it refers to the

254
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,320
data objects inside those networks we

255
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,720
can't we're designing for the worst case

256
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,120
scenario when both sides are opaque it's

257
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,339
nice if both sides are open and so on

258
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,320
but and I when I explain this to people

259
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,560
I sometimes point to just my own ISP you

260
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,779
know cable Last Mile provider in Boston

261
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:37,560
I can't see into my ISP writing table

262
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,180
right unless I they give me

263
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,220
authorization so so and I have to

264
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,660
explain to the

265
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,660
the undergrads uh the internet is is not

266
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,779
the one long contiguous public network

267
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,180
the internet is a sequence of private

268
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,700
isps in this backbone fiber everywhere

269
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,260
right so you guys know I'd have to tell

270
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,800
you guys this but we're trying to

271
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,260
um use the same design principles that

272
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,240
that got us the internet and the

273
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,260
scalable scalable internet for sappy uh

274
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,300
the third one is gateways are assumed to

275
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,279
be trusted we have it we have to assume

276
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,380
that the trusted to even begin this

277
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,820
protocol in reality what's going to

278
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,600
happen is Gateway operators need to take

279
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,519
on liability if they screw up the thing

280
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,860
crashes if they lose an asset they have

281
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,079
to sign on this is to me this is exactly

282
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,560
like a CA a PKA CA issuing certs right

283
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,540
if they screw up if you know

284
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,399
people here from various and if you

285
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,019
screw up you lose somebody's public key

286
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,360
there's a big contract there that says

287
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,220
you're you're liable to a million

288
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,720
dollars 10 million dollars right all

289
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,140
that stuff

290
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,139
yes I I wrote I wrote I was co-author of

291
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,320
the verisign 100 page certificate

292
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,779
practices statement it's now down to the

293
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,120
Cincinnati about it it's like 80 pages

294
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,040
and this warranties there's lines there

295
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,560
and in fact those

296
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,079
so so that's not that's not that's not

297
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,000
the one Rat Hole here that's not the

298
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,980
strike so the other thing that's needed

299
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,260
is that there are cases where you don't

300
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,060
want to move an asset you just want to

301
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,980
extract information out so we've been

302
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,620
using the term views so somebody from

303
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,540
outside might say Hey you know it could

304
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,800
be an auditor it could be the government

305
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,779
say we want to see this particular

306
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,180
transaction on this date on this

307
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,920
particular record can you extract it out

308
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,079
there's also the function of a grade so

309
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,260
it's not moving value it's just

310
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,820
extracting information out we some we

311
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,519
call it data sharing or you know view

312
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,680
sharing it's kind of the same thing next

313
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,920
one

314
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,480
um yeah so this is um motherboard apple

315
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,940
pie so we're just we're just copying uh

316
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,399
the architecture of basically intra

317
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,339
domain inter domain and the last bullet

318
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,860
is the important thing that that for

319
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,680
scalability reasons the Gateway needs to

320
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,200
hide whatever's behind it just like a

321
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,500
bgp router hides the fact that you know

322
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,459
a domain might be running you know ospf

323
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,800
rip one Ripley we don't see it from the

324
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,660
outside in fact the outside doesn't

325
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,240
doesn't really care next slide

326
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,959
so so this is this set of documents that

327
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,440
we propose as the starting point a lot

328
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,060
of them are version zero a lot of them

329
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,420
have holes it is I like the the the SAT

330
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,820
core has like blank sections with the

331
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,339
word TBD in it which is which is fine uh

332
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,980
we're sort of taking our time there uh

333
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,019
and um encourage you to read the

334
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,399
architecture document because it

335
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,139
explains some of the design principles

336
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,139
that we're stealing from the design of

337
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,560
of the internet architecture

338
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,720
um I think this is the slide last slide

339
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,740
okay

340
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,180
any clarifying questions

341
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,380
Alyssa

342
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,260
yeah thanks can you just talk a little

343
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,000
bit more about when you say the gateways

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,040
need to be trusted like

345
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,199
trusted by whom what's the trust right

346
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,079
right so so it needs to be trusted to

347
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,279
function as a uh implementer of the SAT

348
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,800
B protocol all right so

349
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,480
it needs to have keys it's going to be

350
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,660
signing stuff right so

351
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,060
we have no it's not in our power to say

352
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,500
to an implementer this is how you're

353
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,000
going to manage your your private Keys

354
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,560
you're going to use a TPM chip or you're

355
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,300
going to use whatever an sgx capable

356
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,260
Hardware

357
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,079
but we have to assume that both sides

358
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,720
Gateway G1 and G2 have done enough

359
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,560
exchange of information before the flow

360
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,959
occurs that both sides are understanding

361
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,199
that so make it even simpler gateways

362
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,320
have say certificates x509 inserts The

363
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,820
Exchange certs they understand the

364
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,760
search belong to Legal organizations you

365
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,740
know financial institutions branded

366
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,380
financial institutions and they agree to

367
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,880
proceed now

368
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,699
so so when we say trust trust to be

369
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,160
running the protocol correctly how how

370
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,459
they manage keys for example

371
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,560
we don't know we can't say so can you

372
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,360
drop a hint about I think it's in your

373
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,160
later slides but one of your assumptions

374
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,560
has to do with you expect some sort of

375
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,120
agreement between gateways or between

376
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,860
networks it's just like there's

377
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,300
agreements today between routers right

378
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,699
all bgp sessions usually have some sort

379
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,040
of mou or something at least right so so

380
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,680
we've grouped the assumptions into like

381
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,500
three groupings the first one is the

382
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,720
identity of the the Alice Bob the

383
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,940
originator and the receiver and the

384
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,220
Gateway operator so there's four four

385
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,560
people four entities there we assume

386
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,240
that the identities have been resolved

387
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,800
that they know each other the Gateway

388
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,180
providers know each other that's

389
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,240
grouping one grouping two they

390
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,759
understand the type and kind of the

391
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,339
digital asset being moved or so they

392
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,720
understand what's what's happening it's

393
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,100
not that K there's this blob coming

394
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,079
across we don't know what that means so

395
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,899
that's that's assumed and then the third

396
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,519
one is

397
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,639
um there's some legal framework to guide

398
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,419
them just the way and it's a it's a bad

399
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:08,160
analogy the CPS statement for X5 owner

400
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,540
it's a legal document

401
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,020
today in many trading networks uh in the

402
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,119
financial institution they have

403
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,900
agreements and contracts between

404
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,119
networks so we assume I mean they exist

405
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,579
but not in this space but for this new

406
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,160
type of digital asset new type of you

407
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,819
know

408
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,119
um Network we assume they also exist so

409
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,040
those are three groupings that we've

410
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,040
just it's like identity management is

411
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,840
beyond us it's we can't solve that

412
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,720
probably assuming already exists

413
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,059
Eric can you clarify what you mean by

414
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,860
auditability in particular are you

415
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,500
auditing for double spending

416
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,080
can I clarify you said you said this can

417
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,360
be externally audited yeah my question

418
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,960
is is is what are the guarantees we're

419
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,140
attempting to apply here so so the idea

420
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,620
of audit here is that if uh there is

421
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,480
some kind of suspicious activity

422
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,340
occurring right this is what happens

423
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,100
today in the real world okay if if there

424
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,840
is a unusual uh transaction patterns

425
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,360
across say the Swift network uh and huge

426
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,799
amounts of money moving suddenly and

427
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,780
there's a there's a the trends look

428
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,440
there's an anomaly there uh the uh the

429
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,840
end FBI I think is whoever issues SARS

430
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,520
warrants they can issue a war and say we

431
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,900
want to look at that particular

432
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,220
transaction

433
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,380
right so so they must be able to come in

434
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,600
and the Gateway providers and network

435
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,880
members might be able and Alice and Bob

436
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,620
they have to be able to say here's the

437
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,200
transaction that occurred on November

438
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,320
1st at 1am this is what you know this is

439
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,059
what it is so then they need to be able

440
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,640
to look at that

441
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
wow that's not really what I'm not

442
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,580
expecting you to say

443
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,380
um I wouldn't call it audibility I call

444
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,179
it surveillance

445
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,539
um these are quite different concepts so

446
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,240
hmm yeah well you could you could argue

447
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,600
Swift is also being surveilled and and

448
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,280
the credit card networks are being

449
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,020
surveilled we're not trying to solve

450
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,940
that problem that's a that's that's

451
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,400
above my pay grade so well I I guess

452
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
what I'm pushing on is that being a

453
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,820
requirement

454
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,640
as opposed to not trying to solve it is

455
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,919
different from being a requirement

456
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,240
so let me ask you a question happy to

457
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,799
talk about this later but like I I was

458
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,360
genuine anticipating that answer the

459
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,539
question so I'm a little no no but one

460
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,640
of the the things that I think came out

461
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,500
in this box presentation was that list

462
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,179
of assumptions that was missing last

463
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,039
time and actually a lot of it came from

464
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,580
your comment last time Eric because you

465
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,100
said that you weren't able to evaluate

466
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,320
uh the nature of the security of the

467
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,820
transaction without the Assumption so

468
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,919
one of the assumptions here is if you're

469
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,660
going to transfer something from one

470
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,960
digital Bank to another digital Bank

471
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,299
how do you guarantee in the future how

472
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,539
can somebody verify that that there

473
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:55,799
isn't a duplication that you just put

474
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,059
that's what I was expecting him to say

475
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,280
but that's not what he said whatever he

476
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,120
said

477
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,880
no like like no it's like it's an

478
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,160
important Point like like it's one thing

479
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,660
to be the case that bank a says you made

480
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,660
a transfer and Bank B says I didn't

481
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,799
and that's a question of like

482
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,900
non-appediation and then another thing

483
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,760
entirely is some law enforcement

484
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,260
agencies able to go and monitor every

485
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,580
transaction there's like entirely

486
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,799
different contextual Concepts so which

487
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,260
one is it which was the requirement

488
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,580
so

489
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,020
so I I don't want to answer a form

490
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,740
because yeah so it's it's contractual as

491
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,140
okay but then then are we retracting the

492
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,720
claim about the FBI no no so this is

493
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,340
contractual between the two banks that

494
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,380
if there's some dispute they both agree

495
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,820
to be audited

496
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,799
this is how the banking networks work

497
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,520
today okay but yeah wait wait wait when

498
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,900
I asked you that question my apologies

499
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,460
maybe I'm just you know speaking too

500
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,080
fast but yeah okay when I ask you this

501
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,160
question what you said was the

502
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,960
requirement was that if the suspicious

503
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,000
activity that they can go and like look

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,020
at the transaction stream and

505
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,220
like you said to too many transactions

506
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,780
like that's a surveillance property it's

507
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,640
not a it's not it's not an important not

508
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,840
a contract enforcement property and so

509
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,820
um like and like am I supposed to be

510
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,220
very concrete like

511
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,299
um you know it's you can imagine

512
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,380
building a system how to end an

513
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,820
encryption and had installed

514
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,440
non-repediation and therefore did not

515
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,059
have this surveillance property and in

516
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,200
fact like that might be desirable

517
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,220
property so I'm kind of trying to push

518
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,020
up with actual requirements are yeah so

519
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,360
so our focus is the protocol right so

520
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,820
how do players play in the real world

521
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,580
whether they misbehave they try to do

522
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,200
something illegal that's out of scope

523
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,539
for us when when an Engineering Group

524
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:37,919
that's why I can't answer it because

525
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,500
this is a this is a world problem in

526
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,179
like the word surveillance I can't

527
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:43,440
answer no no but this is a question of

528
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
engine requirements the question engine

529
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,799
requirements is is should the is is it a

530
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,900
requirement that people are outside the

531
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,280
sender and receiver of your introduction

532
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
be able to monitor the transactions

533
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,460
authorized if you look at the census

534
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,620
authorized entities so so both sides

535
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,600
needs to agree that you know the

536
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,100
government is allowed to come in right

537
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,960
this is by contract

538
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,600
so if one side says oh I don't I don't

539
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,740
want the government to come in well the

540
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,820
other side might say I don't want to do

541
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,500
any transactions with you that's that's

542
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,260
how it works today and almost you know

543
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,299
tangential to what's happening but this

544
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,820
is what exists today

545
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,900
okay we may need to take this offline

546
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,980
because it's like this is still like a

547
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,440
very confusing answer to me Maybe

548
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,340
yeah so let's let the you thank you

549
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,900
quickly answer that Dennis maybe having

550
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,059
two sides in what you said

551
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,860
the first is the consistency of the

552
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,900
protocol itself so if if we spot

553
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,440
specific assets with specific identities

554
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,200
uh Dennis Dennis avilians I'm the note

555
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,760
taker

556
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,500
somebody take notes please

557
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,059
if we are addressing the problem of

558
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,799
having double spending and spotting the

559
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,539
double spending because we know the uh

560
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,340
the identity of the assets this is part

561
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,159
of what we're doing now uh having a

562
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,620
malicious attempt of a bank spending

563
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,539
twice deliberately

564
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:03,000
uh because of any reason this is outside

565
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,480
the scope

566
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,700
this is not me any of us confused

567
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,700
so let's get back to the queue and and

568
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,320
Eric if you want to get in the queue

569
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,900
again let's do it that way but I think

570
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,659
your point is yeah your point is valid

571
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,460
that there are different types of

572
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,220
verifiability and in the legal construct

573
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,140
would need to specify what type it might

574
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,760
be whether it's always open or whether

575
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,159
it's auditable per record

576
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,059
uh Rick Rick from Ryan oppa Fortress

577
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,400
um would you explain is that you assume

578
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,260
all sorts of things from the networks

579
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,760
that you that you connect you want them

580
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,679
to Gateway

581
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,600
um I could imagine the gateways just be

582
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,059
be connected directly and do nothing in

583
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,200
between

584
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,780
um what I haven't gotten clear is what

585
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,299
sort of Stadium what store what

586
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:53,520
procedures are you trying to establish

587
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,440
what sort of certainty do you want to

588
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,179
give what what are the problems you are

589
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,340
solving that's not completely clear

590
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,340
so the the scope again this is I'm the

591
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,200
first to admit this is a this is a big

592
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,780
big chunk of the pie the little chunk

593
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,400
we're trying to solve is that yellow bit

594
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,860
where we're trying to ensure that when

595
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,260
an when an asset is is being requested

596
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,780
to be moved that that doesn't exist in

597
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,880
two places there's no double spending

598
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,179
that's that's the first one uh and the

599
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,140
you know that if there's any message

600
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,679
um losses or Gateway crashes that

601
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,360
there's sufficient

602
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,179
um data in the flow that one of one of

603
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:34,980
both can recover or just resume or

604
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,539
restart the whole thing right so it

605
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:37,980
needs to be safe

606
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,020
right this is the acid properties that

607
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,659
that safety and an acid that's kind of

608
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,039
what we're shooting for just just for

609
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,960
that and that's why we have to assume

610
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,299
away the all the setup and security

611
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,159
under three groupings that that is what

612
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,620
we call state zero or phase zero all of

613
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,960
that needs to have have happened before

614
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,780
we can even run run the program I hope

615
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,600
that you know it's primarily double

616
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,140
spending and crash recovery is is kind

617
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,080
of you know high on our goal yeah and I

618
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,580
would say double spending something at

619
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,740
the various systems on both ends already

620
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,799
specializing that you want to take take

621
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,780
care of any discrepancies yes State

622
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,700
experience due to for example crashing

623
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,559
that's clear thank you yeah consistency

624
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,299
that's right so sorry about the the is

625
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,679
the formal language you know asset

626
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,260
consistency yeah

627
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,760
leaf

628
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,279
hey nothing so this is a comment on

629
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,500
Eric's point that

630
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,900
I guess the thing I want to say is that

631
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,640
it should come as no surprise that

632
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,679
financial markets or financial industry

633
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,720
is more regulated than other types of

634
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,140
exchanges so it probably is not it

635
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,640
wouldn't be surprising to build a

636
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,980
protocol that contains much more of

637
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,980
surveillance even though those

638
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,539
properties might be even be undesirable

639
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,580
internally to some of these networks

640
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,620
that may not be properties that you can

641
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,940
maintain when you transfer between

642
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,559
networks

643
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,179
um

644
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:02,400
and this also made me think about sort

645
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,860
of the reason I came to take a look at

646
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,039
this I'm a co-chair of the Tigers

647
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,299
working group and if you look at that

648
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,460
that's kind of also one of these smooth

649
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,679
stuff between wallets

650
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,480
um in that case it's a personal wallet

651
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,080
and I I'm not 100 sure that these are

652
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,480
always valuable distinctions and I think

653
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,799
one of the things we should think about

654
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,260
sort of in a activity like this is

655
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,760
whether there are where there is

656
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,340
significant overlap between you know

657
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,820
other ITF activities right if you if you

658
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,100
want to like make a a very very silliest

659
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,740
woman argument I mean you have some acid

660
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,360
properties when you transfer a domain

661
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,000
name as well between registers that

662
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,860
doesn't necessarily mean we shouldn't go

663
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,419
and build

664
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,880
um Bitcoin to ethereum uh transfer on

665
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,740
Epp right at maybe a bit too silly right

666
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,140
um but there's definitely like a line

667
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,900
where it becomes silly to kind of build

668
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,240
two transfer protocols just because one

669
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,559
wallet is in the hand of a new

670
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,659
individual and the other type of wallet

671
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,059
is in kind of an Oregon to whatever I

672
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,520
call it so I would actually

673
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,279
um like to have a conversation about to

674
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,980
do are we actually already doing this

675
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,240
somewhere else in the ITF and we could

676
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,500
just adapt

677
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,840
uh whatever we're doing in some other

678
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,820
place to do this as well

679
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,100
so that's that's solution farming so at

680
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,480
this point we have two different cues

681
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,760
and they're very different Paul

682
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,380
no

683
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,740
you're Paul okay

684
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,779
all right so Roman you're next and then

685
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,640
Colin and then we'll we'll let you do it

686
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,720
but do note that you're normally

687
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,220
supposed to join the the virtual queue

688
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,600
but I'm going to honor the virtual cue

689
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,500
first because that's what we're supposed

690
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,520
to do so yeah I'm okay okay go ahead

691
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,440
sorry it's my first uh no that's okay

692
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,720
that's okay uh so my name is is Gilbert

693
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,880
Verdian uh I'm a cyber security

694
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,620
background

695
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,880
um reason why I'm here today is uh I I

696
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,919
established the iso blockchain standard

697
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,179
tc307 in 2016. there's 57 countries

698
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,659
working on that today so that is a an

699
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,720
international standard which as ISO is

700
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,299
is the right venue for what ISO is doing

701
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,400
is at the top level in terms of

702
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,659
governance

703
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,179
in terms of descriptive uh standards and

704
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,220
there's already quite a few out

705
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,140
um I actually chair interoperability at

706
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,600
within ISO in working group seven and

707
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,799
what we're doing is creating an

708
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,140
interoperability framework and and that

709
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,760
basically is what are the building

710
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,279
blocks that different vendors and

711
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,620
participants need to create in order to

712
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,179
create standards that the industry can

713
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,179
adopt it's not prescriptive it's not

714
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:42,299
saying the packet should be 64k it

715
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,039
should over check some of this and it

716
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:47,220
should have a anak uh handshake of that

717
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,559
it's not prescriptive in that sense and

718
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,320
that's where institutions and bodies

719
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,960
like ietf come in and what we kind of

720
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,360
expect is the technical engineering to

721
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,940
be done within engineering organizations

722
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,960
like IEEE and ITF and that feeds in to

723
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,820
the standard that's coming out of iso

724
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,580
already so I'm very supportive of this

725
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,380
and I'd really like to kind of bring

726
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,960
some experience working in banking and

727
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,600
in government in on the cyber security

728
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,299
decide one of the comments made is is

729
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,640
this a type of surveillance I would

730
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,919
argue no it's not a type of surveillance

731
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,279
it's it's a protocol enabling

732
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,419
interoperability between different types

733
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,299
of networks who uses that network has to

734
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,760
sign up to some scheme rules and this is

735
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,760
consistent with what um happens in card

736
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,340
networks payment networks Swift type

737
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,880
banking networks so if there's an issue

738
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,940
it's up to the participant to respond to

739
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,460
that suspicious activity resolve a

740
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,679
dispute between them and they're all in

741
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,360
writing in contracts within the

742
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,039
different participants within the scheme

743
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,020
so the way it works is you're not

744
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,659
relying on the technical protocol to

745
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,159
solve your problem you're relying on

746
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,440
human interaction and contractual rules

747
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,779
to solve the problem so this protocol is

748
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,240
not here to solve that issue it's here

749
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,460
to solve the technical interconnectivity

750
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,440
between these different networks and one

751
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,720
final thing to say is digital assets

752
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,779
what we've got in ISO as as a as a

753
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,659
defined vocabulary standard so this is

754
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:22,740
in uh ISO cd22739 terminology and

755
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,720
digital assets have been defined as an

756
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,640
asset that exists only in digital form

757
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,039
or that has been converted from some

758
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,620
other form to a digital representation

759
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,260
now these digital assets are here today

760
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,380
and they're not going away what we've

761
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,140
seen from working with central banks and

762
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,940
other banks that at the company are

763
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,120
working at Quant is there's a 16

764
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,520
trillion dollar opportunity with digital

765
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,880
assets by 2030. so people are digitizing

766
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,640
what they've some some form of asset

767
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,399
that used to be uh in in a different

768
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,799
form into a digital form and that's not

769
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,020
going away but the problem which I saw

770
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,500
from 2015 2016 was people are making

771
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,240
these in isolation and people are making

772
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,080
these in silos so how can these assets

773
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,220
interoperate and how they how can they

774
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,960
interconnect between the different

775
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,659
networks and ITF is is the right venue

776
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,640
to create the protocol to do it all

777
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,399
right thank you Roman

778
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,500
hi Roman denilio Carnegie Mellon

779
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,480
University no hat I couldn't get my

780
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,340
laptop to connect so Paul put me in the

781
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,340
queue uh so back to helping tease out

782
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,200
this double kind of spend problem we use

783
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,700
lots of different words so I want to try

784
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,760
my attempt at pulling pulling this apart

785
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,580
the question is when we talk about how

786
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,020
is the double spending problem kind of

787
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,419
resolved to me is it is all of that in

788
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:45,179
scope or some of it at a scope so I

789
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,620
could imagine a world where you could

790
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,360
use different fancy kind of cryptography

791
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,679
different kind of acknowledgments where

792
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,840
the things that are getting exchanged

793
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,700
that's all packed in scope in the

794
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,860
protocol and that's how you do the how

795
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,120
you address the double spending problem

796
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,059
what I think I heard you say is that

797
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,760
there are part of that verification

798
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,559
process is out of scope so when you said

799
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,360
surveillance I think what you were

800
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,399
saying correct me if wrong is that the

801
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,820
gateways have to produce an audit log so

802
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,159
the end-to-end double spend verification

803
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,919
is actually not a protocol and not a

804
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,720
product of the protocol there are just

805
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,580
some requirements about Telemetry or

806
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,720
whatever the word you want to use that

807
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,539
the protocol will squirt and to get the

808
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,399
double spend verification actually is

809
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,960
something that's out of scope of the

810
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,860
problem

811
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,960
of the protocol and of the working group

812
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,640
is that accurate yes so we've been

813
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,820
talking about two classes of logs

814
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,240
so so the gateways need to log for

815
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,960
message uh completeness and and proof

816
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,279
that both sides have done the right

817
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,220
thing per the RFC the the draft

818
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,260
definition and then it needs to allow

819
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,360
for crash recovery there might be some

820
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,460
overlap in terms of the same data log to

821
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,320
be reused for another but we talk about

822
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,179
two sets but you're right Roman that's

823
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,960
kind of you're right yeah so my request

824
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,279
would be if as we kind of talk through

825
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,480
this when we talk about the security

826
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,460
properties we can we if we could

827
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,559
distinguish the enablers that the

828
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,360
protocol will have versus what the

829
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,740
protocol itself will kind of guarantee

830
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,240
and that might help us with what's in

831
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,039
scope and what's what's not and as we

832
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,879
know this is a good point

833
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,700
uh okay Colin James let's go

834
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,899
um

835
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,880
I'm trying to think whether Rowan's just

836
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,500
just answered my question but some like

837
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,380
so the question I was going to ask is so

838
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,419
is the Assumption here is that the

839
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:33,240
participants in a given Network trust

840
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,279
the Gateway not to double spend due to

841
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,779
Legal agreements or whatever else they

842
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,080
have in place not due to protocol

843
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,919
cryptographics correct is that correct

844
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,019
correct so

845
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:44,880
gateways have to sign stuff you know

846
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,039
they're going to use TLs but you know if

847
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,899
they're sending you know crucial

848
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,460
messages there'll be signatures and so

849
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,159
on but yes quick answer yes thank you

850
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,200
Colin that's an important point

851
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,000
all right with that I think we'll shift

852
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,080
to use cases next

853
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,279
uh there are two

854
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,100
um again we will ask for clarifying

855
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,580
uh after each one uh these should have

856
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,139
less clarifying questions so really just

857
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,460
clarifying questions about the use case

858
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,739
not about uh the protocol itself that

859
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,219
will come later

860
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,940
and is that's the wrong one isn't it

861
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,780
is that the right one okay

862
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,060
hi can you hear me we can yep

863
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,399
yep all right uh can you move to the

864
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,980
person I think yep

865
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,739
all right so hi everyone I'm Rama I was

866
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,199
uh present at the last iitf meeting at

867
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,859
Philadelphia where uh I see uh several

868
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,599
people here who are present there as

869
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,418
well and I talked about the use case

870
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,580
involving uh global trade and Supply

871
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,300
chains so uh I'm just going to uh talk

872
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,560
about uh

873
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,140
same use case here with a bit more

874
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,800
context and try to show you how it's uh

875
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,900
it's not like a very Niche problem but

876
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,720
rather it's a it's a problem that's very

877
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,940
highly relevant to ensuring that Supply

878
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,520
chains that you're all dependent on uh

879
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,180
work properly in the upcoming digitized

880
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,980
and distributed

881
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,560
so uh just providing a bit more context

882
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,280
than I did previous time uh the global

883
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,380
trade has has been conducted in the past

884
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,220
few centuries and uh several processes

885
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,920
have cropped up in in the space have

886
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,960
been built on paper naturally it's not a

887
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,140
computers until the future so these

888
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,599
paper-based policies are quite manual

889
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,079
and they're time consuming and the uh

890
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,320
any uh clearance or any uh finalization

891
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,020
of a transaction it takes too long and

892
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,540
uh it can often be susceptible to fraud

893
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,820
by different uh participants and there

894
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,260
are a lot of those participants in you

895
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,460
know in a particular supply chain you

896
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,000
see that in the subsequent Slide

897
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,280
the shippers or the sellers and the

898
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,720
buyers or you can think of them as

899
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,660
importers and exporters who are usually

900
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,880
always in different countries uh they

901
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,480
face a lot of God when it comes to

902
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,339
fulfilling and international export

903
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,160
import transaction so there's a lot of

904
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,040
incentive to reduce the the cost make

905
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,099
this more efficient because finally that

906
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,560
will uh result in benefits to all of us

907
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,240
as entrance uh the the way trade happens

908
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,760
in this analog world it gives very

909
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,859
little ability to forecast any uh

910
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,680
disruptions that a supply chain faces in

911
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,320
real time so any anything any message

912
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,440
that occurs it takes a while for uh the

913
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,300
applications to be discovered and then

914
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,839
it takes a long time for uh debugging

915
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,859
and root cause analysis again

916
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,140
also given that you have a lot of

917
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,060
different players spread across

918
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,220
different countries uh participating in

919
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,480
different institutions that have their

920
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,140
own privacy rules uh sharing information

921
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,020
across these parties and across

922
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,820
institutions is a very challenging task

923
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,040
and

924
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,359
digitization is something that is like

925
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,400
solely necessary for all of these

926
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,200
different reasons an excitement

927
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,960
so uh one uh I'll zoom into one

928
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,240
particular problem that is very Salient

929
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,460
whenever any two parties conduct a trade

930
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,980
and imagine an exporter and importer or

931
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,400
let's call them your buyer buyer and

932
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,880
shipper uh if uh think of the problem

933
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,060
that it's most basic a buyer and a

934
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,700
shipper or let me call them by himself a

935
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,680
buyer makes a deal with the seller that

936
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,900
if a seller ships uh sends the buyer

937
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,180
particular uh set of goods then the

938
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,280
buyer is obligated to make a particular

939
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,980
amount of payment uh now

940
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,619
uh this is challenging across two

941
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,480
different countries because the question

942
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,060
always is who blinks first if the seller

943
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,980
shifts the goods first what guarantees

944
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,420
will have with the buyers go to make a

945
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,119
payment and if the buyer instead makes a

946
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,859
payment first what guarantees does it

947
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:12,780
get that the seller is going to actually

948
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,240
ship the goods so what's happened in the

949
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,359
past few uh centuries really a processes

950
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,579
that have evolved since the dawn of

951
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:24,420
banking to manage the property to to see

952
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,700
apart the this process for both the

953
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,359
buyer and seller and uh one of those

954
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,780
documents uh that is used in uh to to

955
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,520
see about the process called the bill of

956
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,760
ladies so uh What uh what happens here

957
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,359
is that uh the buyer usually takes a

958
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,339
short-term loan from some financial

959
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,859
institution let's say it's a it's a it's

960
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,180
a bank that has International

961
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,780
connections uh with whom the buyer is an

962
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,599
account uh possibly or or perhaps not

963
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,880
but the buyer can take a loan from that

964
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,579
financial institution uh in order to pay

965
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,500
the pay the seller in effect what

966
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,079
happens here and if you use uh there are

967
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,180
uh proceed like the letter of credit

968
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,060
that the buyer can use to get such a

969
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,260
loan issued from the financial

970
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,300
institution uh whereby the financial

971
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,520
institution actually agrees to take

972
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,960
liability uh uh on behalf of the buyer

973
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,180
thereby making a promise to the seller

974
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,280
and also the financial institution back

975
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,980
in the seller to make a payment once the

976
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,740
seller ships equipment uh so what is the

977
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,900
role does this billion document play the

978
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,220
bill of trading document is something

979
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,040
that the seller uh generates in

980
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,520
connection with the uh the carrier who

981
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,020
takes possession of the goods once the

982
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,660
goods are ready to ship and this bill of

983
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,119
reading is proof that the seller has

984
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,880
parted with the goods and what happens

985
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,380
after that is

986
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,839
anybody who produces the bill of lading

987
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,960
before the buyer in effect gets it has a

988
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,359
guarantee from the buyer that the buyer

989
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,400
will make the payment as it's obliged

990
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,720
in reality what happens if it's actually

991
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,400
the financial institution but in the

992
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,660
buyer who's supposed to make that

993
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,060
payment so the bill of trading is a very

994
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,980
crucial document because it constitutes

995
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,740
proof that will conclude a an import

996
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,320
export transaction good search it shows

997
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,960
that goods are shipped and it it

998
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,720
obligates somebody to make a payment uh

999
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,420
so the financial institutions uh needs

1000
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,280
this uh bill of rating is collateral by

1001
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,599
the way there's a lot of Finance

1002
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,400
involved in in this bill of training can

1003
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,320
be used collateral it can be sold print

1004
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,780
off as a financial account so we don't

1005
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,400
have to worry about that we just pointed

1006
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,140
about the problem where we want to

1007
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,240
ensure a safe transaction

1008
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,839
so uh the financial institution uh in

1009
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,079
this case uh needs the bill of radius

1010
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,800
collateral so it knows that uh there is

1011
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,839
proof of the goods having been ship but

1012
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,680
it cannot change okay uh usually in the

1013
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,500
the way they had seen uh in the process

1014
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,119
of digitization of the philosophy in the

1015
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,880
past few years is that the financing

1016
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,520
part of a trade is carried out in one

1017
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,859
particular Network whereas the shipping

1018
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:09,960
part and the generation of the bills of

1019
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,520
documents like the bills of plating is

1020
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,079
carried out in a different network and

1021
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,520
these two networks are a big feature

1022
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,160
they are oblivious of each other and

1023
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,380
they were built separately for

1024
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,940
particular reasons there are there are

1025
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,920
privacy reasons why the consortia that

1026
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,599
maintain these networks choose to be

1027
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,240
separate and we see that and continuing

1028
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,940
uh so the financial institutions needs

1029
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,619
to see the block rating but it cannot

1030
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,420
actually appear intra permission so what

1031
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,800
does it do

1032
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,060
the way we can bridge to uh networks is

1033
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,339
why I get the kind that Thomas talked

1034
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:45,900
about and uh the uh and these networks

1035
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,000
need to be interoperable for all the

1036
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,820
reasons that uh uh Gilbert so adequently

1037
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,480
put uh in his uh comments shortly so

1038
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,920
this bill of plating data must be

1039
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,680
reported from the network that is

1040
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,900
surrounding the take Logistics via a

1041
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,020
Gateway that uh acts as a neutral

1042
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,640
service provider on behalf of that

1043
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,099
Logistics Network that is maintaining

1044
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,500
development okay next slide please all

1045
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,820
right so there's one question at the

1046
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,500
microphone that I think they have on if

1047
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,119
you have a question on this slide I take

1048
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,060
it yes I'm a clarifying question so um

1049
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,640
on this slide to me it it kind of looks

1050
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,880
like the the what's really described

1051
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,619
there is sort of a transparency problem

1052
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:29,280
that is kind of already in scope for the

1053
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,339
um for the skit uh working group so it

1054
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:34,020
it

1055
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,119
so what I would like to understand

1056
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,220
better

1057
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,160
um is how this really is a as described

1058
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,040
here how this really is a transfer of of

1059
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,619
an asset um to me it sounds like it's

1060
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,980
the the bill of lading and you I the the

1061
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,320
financial institution needs like a

1062
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,599
trusted way to look into the other to

1063
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,400
the bill of leading Network and see that

1064
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,180
that BL exists and that to me sounds

1065
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,780
like a transparency issue not a transfer

1066
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,819
it's not an asset yeah these are

1067
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:08,220
actually rated yeah yeah so so let me

1068
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,200
answer that one Rama that there are

1069
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,119
three types of flows that we have if you

1070
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,339
look at the draft Charter uh the first

1071
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:16,200
one I was talking about was an actual

1072
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,780
asset transfer and this one is what we

1073
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,599
call uh asset related data sharing I've

1074
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,880
been talking about extracting data now

1075
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,540
the the problem is that the other the

1076
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,119
bank may want that bill of lading today

1077
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,099
you actually have to bring a printout

1078
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,079
you know understood yeah yeah you know

1079
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,819
that's I understand the requirement yeah

1080
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:38,220
so so this is this is extracting the

1081
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,560
relevant fields from the state data I

1082
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,480
didn't understood my question is whether

1083
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,599
you know we should maybe actually focus

1084
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,400
on the actual transfer situations

1085
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,160
because the the the transparency case is

1086
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,560
already covered in in the skipped

1087
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,780
working group

1088
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,579
I've been participating in this this kid

1089
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,500
working group and I'll be the first to

1090
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,000
say there is a lot of similarities that

1091
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,880
this uh information

1092
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,280
transfer extraction and and skit yeah so

1093
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,480
let me let me put it another way right

1094
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,000
if we can reuse parts that are in

1095
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,339
another you know ietf area that's

1096
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:14,099
exactly what we always do and the

1097
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,260
question to me is whether they need to

1098
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,420
be bound together or whether they can be

1099
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,460
two different protocols and so I'll

1100
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,040
leave that to the future but uh Romans

1101
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,380
as cognizant ad of the skit working

1102
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,680
group uh the scope of skit is the

1103
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,960
software supply chain we talked a lot

1104
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,359
about dual use or kind of using it

1105
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,740
outside of that use case but that's all

1106
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,359
we're chartered to do

1107
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:39,119
uh thank you uh John and then we should

1108
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,560
get on to the rest of the presentation

1109
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,420
robot from you why I think the key thing

1110
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,319
here is is that there is an asset on at

1111
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,380
least one side of the Gateway

1112
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,480
um and I think that's that's the key

1113
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,420
thing is is that the you know the

1114
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,339
control of that asset whatever that

1115
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:05,220
asset does which is the the financial

1116
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,980
side of it

1117
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,900
requires the information on the other

1118
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,960
side so it's not purely transparency I

1119
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,460
think that might be a distinguishing

1120
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,359
characteristic

1121
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,040
okay uh thank you I actually have a

1122
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,780
question now but I'll I'll return it to

1123
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,660
uh the presentation

1124
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,440
sure just to conclude that that point

1125
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,760
for transparency

1126
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,839
uh

1127
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,700
I mean we can probably go into this

1128
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,200
later in the presentation or during the

1129
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,740
discussion uh think of you have two uh

1130
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,780
you have a network here that is

1131
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,339
maintaining a document like the bill of

1132
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:44,640
lading uh the the bill of reading now

1133
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,000
has this uh the information in this bill

1134
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,280
of lading is quite crucial to a

1135
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,619
concluding a process that is beyond the

1136
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:55,560
scope of that particular Network so uh

1137
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,760
we need some somebody or some process by

1138
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,520
which the this information uh the bill

1139
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,240
of bleeding exists and that uh

1140
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,520
and here are the properties of this bill

1141
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,640
of leading and here is authentic proof

1142
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,800
that this bill of dating is actually uh

1143
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,359
hosted on this network which is now

1144
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,780
opaque to parties that are Beyond its uh

1145
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,960
its confines that is really crucial and

1146
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,900
uh in effect what we're trying to do is

1147
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,079
uh to figure out a view of the to

1148
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,000
provide a view into the will of leading

1149
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,160
to parties that do not actually belong

1150
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,140
to this network that were not parties

1151
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,599
who are not the buyer not the seller not

1152
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,160
the financial institution back in the

1153
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,180
buyer not the carrier that is uh

1154
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,760
uh has taken possession records that the

1155
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,099
sellers provided so that's what this

1156
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,500
example tries to illustrate you have a

1157
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,119
financial institution that is outside

1158
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,599
the uh this uh supply chain intake

1159
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:56,940
logistic promotion Network and that

1160
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,980
needs to know it needs to have you into

1161
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,079
what's going on in the logistics part of

1162
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:04,319
the tree so it requests for uh the bill

1163
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,240
of cleaning and it now it can in effect

1164
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,560
what it's trying to do is strength

1165
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,300
request the network to provide to say

1166
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,000
show me your real estate but what we

1167
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,800
need is some standard way to do this

1168
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,780
because the bill of reading and you see

1169
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,220
later on there's a lot in the sufficient

1170
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,560
documents the uh it's not just one kind

1171
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,200
of document that we want to be able to

1172
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,060
expose via this uh from these such kind

1173
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,619
of networks it's just any kind of

1174
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:31,200
document uh any kind of asset or any

1175
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,060
kind of artifact uh whose properties

1176
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,160
need to be visible in a controlled way

1177
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,160
outside that Network and the Gateway we

1178
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,660
do that Gateway provides a neutral way

1179
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,660
of exposing views from private networks

1180
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,520
so that's what this uh International

1181
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,220
this uh slide is showing up uh

1182
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,140
Eliminator 2.1 seconds so two things

1183
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,000
um one we probably need to speed up a

1184
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,160
little bit I think the slides are um uh

1185
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,540
you're over describing them a little bit

1186
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,460
we're going to run out of time too for

1187
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,980
the people at the Queue at the moment uh

1188
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,380
is it relevant to this slide or the

1189
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,060
whole concept if it's the whole concept

1190
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,280
let's take it after the presentation uh

1191
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,200
it's the slide for me okay

1192
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,200
yeah uh Roman junaidu no hat Carnegie

1193
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,180
Mellon University uh a little bit like

1194
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,520
leaf and this use case

1195
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,800
I don't I'm trying to square the

1196
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,680
definition of an asset which is

1197
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,000
value-bearing something I forgot the

1198
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,160
rest of the words and a bill of lading

1199
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,619
because isn't a maybe in my head a bill

1200
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,020
lading is an inventory or is this like a

1201
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,660
bearer token it's it's yeah it's a it's

1202
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,359
a deed it's your house deed okay so I

1203
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,280
hold the bill of lading I get to have

1204
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,780
everything on the ship just because I

1205
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,020
hold a piece of paper yeah thank you yes

1206
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,300
Eric okay we can move on to the next

1207
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,760
slide oh no but I'm actually not no I'm

1208
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,380
now I'm confused

1209
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,280
um

1210
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,220
um because like

1211
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,920
so I guess the point I'm confused about

1212
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,079
is that

1213
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:02,220
I thought this is about transferring

1214
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,560
assets like I'm expecting to see a g on

1215
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,819
the other side of this as opposed like a

1216
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,260
little old Bank

1217
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,359
um and could you move the slide forward

1218
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,740
it's like yeah could you move forward

1219
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,260
twice to slice for it um there's another

1220
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,680
diagram

1221
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,220
uh did you did you say two slides or one

1222
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,380
slide this one

1223
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,359
okay

1224
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,060
okay yeah so so this is the thing that

1225
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,440
we are doing now and the other thing

1226
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,180
with background

1227
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,220
no no that's okay

1228
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,460
okay let me say so you can you can

1229
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,079
combine this in two different ways you

1230
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:39,119
have what is what you're showing here if

1231
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,800
you go from left to right there's a bill

1232
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,660
of reading on the network on the left

1233
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,980
which is being exposed through gate to

1234
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,500
G1 and there's a letter of credit on the

1235
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,640
network to the right which is being

1236
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,920
exposed by Gateway G2 what we're showing

1237
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,240
in this use case is a composition of

1238
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,400
both of them and both of them if we

1239
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,720
combine them together we are showing

1240
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,180
what can be possible in the supply chain

1241
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,920
and finance rule

1242
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,200
okay but I guess what I guess what I'm

1243
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,720
being confused by is like

1244
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,700
if we have an assertion

1245
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,339
of this bill of lading that is

1246
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,780
if I understand it being transferred

1247
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,579
from the seller to the buyer

1248
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,079
um like surely we don't want to have a

1249
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:14,040
bearer token which we're then going to

1250
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,660
apply to the bank who could then take

1251
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,160
all my stuff right that's not that's not

1252
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,660
a desirable outcome right

1253
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,640
no no um

1254
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,579
so the bill of leading on the uh on the

1255
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,680
network to the left it is actually

1256
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,020
something negotiated between the seller

1257
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,960
and the carrier the carrier so the when

1258
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,180
the seller ships goods via a particular

1259
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,400
carrier they have done that part in the

1260
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,500
export import so the carrier is now

1261
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,020
supposed to provide a bill of reading to

1262
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,940
the seller this is the seller can then

1263
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,099
take to any financial institution and

1264
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:46,200
say look not any financial institution

1265
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,640
just keep the bias financial institution

1266
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,980
and say look I ship the goods here's the

1267
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,200
proof you got the bill of trading now uh

1268
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,180
give make my payment that cannot happen

1269
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,760
in networks which are signed like this

1270
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,079
which are isolated like this but that's

1271
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,240
what we live in you have networks which

1272
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,760
only run a store plating you have other

1273
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,859
networks that only that the web

1274
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:07,380
financial institutions have a play part

1275
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,960
that's a network on the right so how to

1276
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,200
uh the uh

1277
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,280
share how do they share this information

1278
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,280
so that their respective processes can

1279
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,880
continue without uh in a trustworthy

1280
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,720
manner so that's why

1281
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,920
[Music]

1282
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,640
use of a particular uh record across the

1283
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,559
network boundaries that is from one

1284
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,720
network to another in a way that does

1285
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,420
not require uh the two networks to

1286
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,400
understand each other's internals so the

1287
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,740
Gateway is understand this point because

1288
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,140
I answer my question

1289
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,520
um my question is a question is simply

1290
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,920
about if is this a bearer token and if

1291
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,720
it's a bearer token then then why am i

1292
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,579
showing it to the bank it's it's it's

1293
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,740
not a bear token so this is flow number

1294
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,260
two is extracting information to show to

1295
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,960
the financial entity that this tool

1296
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,540
exists on the network and so Gateway G1

1297
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,240
needs to sign this this data it's not an

1298
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,119
asset itself it's a report it's a subset

1299
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:16,280
of the fields well that's the party okay

1300
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,559
so no it's not a bear of tokens no no no

1301
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:22,319
so all right yes this is the and I'm

1302
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,040
equally confused hacker so

1303
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,920
just a control question for either

1304
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,460
you said to to Roman that it's a it's

1305
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,440
sort of like the deed to my house but

1306
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,540
does the does the bank or the financial

1307
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,319
institution in this example do they own

1308
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:46,740
my shipment when I take the loan uh take

1309
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,380
speaking they own the deed yes until so

1310
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,300
it's a short term so so you give them

1311
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,900
the deed to go to my house to the stuff

1312
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,420
on the ship they give you a loan to pay

1313
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,880
the sell the right the shipper right but

1314
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,460
that but it's not that you're not you're

1315
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,319
actually giving them ownership

1316
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,480
temporarily yes legally you are giving

1317
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,819
them ownership yes yes so it is so

1318
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,619
actually this is this is what they do

1319
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:12,599
today no I understand by bringing this

1320
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:15,059
up this is not enough that's fine it's

1321
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,700
not in a problem scope I'm not trying to

1322
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,079
change Hotel I'm going to start trying

1323
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:20,579
to understand it because what my

1324
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:22,680
argument was that it was a transparency

1325
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,920
issue that it's about showing that you

1326
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,660
have stuff on the ship and the right

1327
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,880
Stones correct which is different from

1328
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,000
giving it to the bank you now own it and

1329
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,740
that's the thing all right I'm getting

1330
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,200
pure answers

1331
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,579
so there are two different things going

1332
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:40,500
on here so let's not get confused so

1333
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,119
there's a there's a process of trade

1334
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,579
financing which involves a buyer taking

1335
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:45,420
out a loan with the financial

1336
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,980
institution and the financial

1337
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,859
institution there thereby if if it gets

1338
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,599
the bill of leading which is like the

1339
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,420
title to the shipment then yes the

1340
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,980
financial institution gets to keep the

1341
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,960
shipment until the biography of the loan

1342
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,540
but what we're talking about here is the

1343
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,000
fact that you have the financial part of

1344
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,579
a trade uh of an export import running

1345
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,800
on one particular Network whose

1346
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,240
activities are opaque to the external

1347
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,579
world and then you have the shipment of

1348
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:13,260
the logistics part of it turning on a

1349
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,760
different network which is again opaque

1350
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,680
to anybody outside of it how do you

1351
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,819
connect the two they have to make them

1352
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:19,260
interoperable the way we make them

1353
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,140
profitable or uh allow them to provide

1354
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,200
youth into restricted use into their

1355
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,180
records which in this case involves

1356
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,000
those of trading on the left Network let

1357
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,099
us read it on the right side Network you

1358
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:34,140
do that using these Gateway you can

1359
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,780
communicate using a neutral protocol

1360
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,880
Rama I think we need to move forward

1361
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,099
yeah so in interest of time I think that

1362
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:42,839
we need to probably switch to the other

1363
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,520
use case which is possibly a little bit

1364
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,099
simpler I I yeah I'll just make a quick

1365
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:49,079
point on the last Slide the next

1366
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:51,079
classified

1367
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,700
so uh the documents we've been talking

1368
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,859
about right bill of leading uh letters

1369
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,260
of credit these are you might think

1370
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,480
these are like Niche uh use cases we're

1371
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,520
talking about but no just in the trade

1372
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,140
space you have a nautilus or document

1373
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,940
that you see here and if you have

1374
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,059
networks that need to incorporate for uh

1375
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,160
providing views into such documents

1376
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,980
the the same security uh problem will

1377
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,020
arise in each of the wheels cases and if

1378
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,339
you go to the next slide

1379
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:19,920
uh you have a lot of different different

1380
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,440
uh parties that are involved in this

1381
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,200
kind of ecosystem and uh this gets very

1382
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,420
complex very fast unless we have a

1383
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,099
neutral protocol that allows two

1384
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:30,059
different networks to operate

1385
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:34,220
interoperate thank you

1386
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,839
okay thank you

1387
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:39,359
um I'm having a browser difficulty that

1388
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,380
I have to overcome here

1389
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,599
I don't know if Becca is being shared

1390
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,859
I bet it's the wrong one

1391
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:58,980
I need to restart my browser

1392
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,540
unfortunately

1393
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,880
uh if you're on you could

1394
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,160
now this is a weird too many X-Files

1395
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,480
open socket problem

1396
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,660
foreign

1397
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,880
agenda sorry about this

1398
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,480
why don't you start talking about your

1399
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,940
use case well I I'm almost there okay

1400
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,800
is it is okay this is the right place

1401
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,640
for the microphone cool so I will um

1402
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,140
eat the microphone the little person

1403
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,000
yeah there you go okay that's not too

1404
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,220
bad Okay cool so Martin High groups um

1405
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,260
I'm from Quant I'll be talking about the

1406
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,059
uh the asset transfer use case which is

1407
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:07,319
obviously the main use case for this

1408
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:08,760
protocol

1409
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,980
um I'm I'll wait for the slides a little

1410
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,660
bit but effectively

1411
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,839
um I'll start talking anyway so the

1412
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,119
Financial Services Market is moving in

1413
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:19,920
the direction of tokenization which is a

1414
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,660
bit of a buzzword but effectively means

1415
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,300
digitally representing

1416
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,520
um a variety of assets and then trading

1417
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,079
them particularly things that couldn't

1418
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,640
be traded before

1419
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,000
so there are assets out there which can

1420
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,859
be traded which represent things like

1421
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:37,440
future Revenue flows right so you can

1422
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,480
buy a fraction of the income that you

1423
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,680
will get when this thing comes to Market

1424
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,480
there's a Supercar manufacturer that

1425
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,339
does this that's how they fund the build

1426
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:45,619
of their cars

1427
00:57:45,619 --> 00:57:47,700
likewise real estate is being

1428
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,960
fractionalized lots of things are being

1429
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,280
fractionized this is a big Trend in

1430
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,400
financial services and these new digital

1431
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,700
tokens uh are being traded on a new

1432
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,339
class of trading venues effectively

1433
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:02,460
marketplaces so

1434
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,319
they are not connected they're built on

1435
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,119
a new generation of Technology some of

1436
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:07,800
it is distributed Ledger some of it is

1437
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,420
not but the main point about it is that

1438
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,040
they are mostly not being connected to

1439
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,359
each other

1440
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:15,300
um from a industry point of view there's

1441
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,040
quite strong Network effects in this

1442
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,380
kind of thing so you see in the more

1443
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,940
established markets there's quite a lot

1444
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,040
of big trading venues they connect to

1445
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,180
each other

1446
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,099
um likewise internet lots of isps

1447
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:28,140
connect to each other whether things are

1448
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,880
proprietary you have marketplaces like

1449
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,980
eBay Alibaba and literally nothing else

1450
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,380
right so Network effects can play in

1451
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,299
your favor or not ah we've got slight

1452
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:38,880
awesome so this is this Walled Garden

1453
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,940
problem that we are looking at at the

1454
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,740
moment because

1455
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,220
um there are dozens to in larger

1456
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,380
economies low digit hundreds of new

1457
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,240
venues coming up

1458
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,680
um and the way I like to think of them

1459
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,059
they are like marketplace right so if

1460
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:55,380
you've created one of these tokens and

1461
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,839
you want to sell it it's analogous to

1462
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,819
something like eBay right so we were

1463
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:01,020
talking about this before and it's

1464
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,599
effectively if I want to sell

1465
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,119
a GPU right and I want to sell it on

1466
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:07,380
eBay

1467
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,059
um then that's fine anyone on eBay can

1468
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:10,980
buy it but if I've got a buyer who is on

1469
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,960
Alibaba or something like that how do I

1470
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,940
let them see it what we are trying to do

1471
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,280
is basically be able to show it on the

1472
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,839
other venue be able to people to buy it

1473
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:20,819
on the other venue the digital

1474
00:59:20,819 --> 00:59:22,799
representation travels transparently

1475
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:24,240
from one to the other fulfillment

1476
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,280
happens and the reason why we're trying

1477
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,780
to do that is because there's not just

1478
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,220
eBay and Alibaba but there's a lot of

1479
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,980
these things so as a someone who's

1480
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,900
issuing this token who wants to sell it

1481
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,420
I want as many people as possible to be

1482
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,040
able to buy it and those people are not

1483
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,079
all going to be customers of the one or

1484
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,299
two places that I'm a customer of so we

1485
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:43,740
want to link all of these things to

1486
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,500
create a larger market effect

1487
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,760
I think so yes fragmented markets poor

1488
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,619
issue issue as investors here are the

1489
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:54,900
buyers and the sellers limited liquidity

1490
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,460
potential means there's less people to

1491
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,540
buy it

1492
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,099
um and in the case of these sorts of

1493
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:01,799
assets that kind of creates

1494
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,900
um a lot of inefficiency which usually

1495
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,000
means somebody can buy it for cheap on

1496
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,020
this one and they can sell it for

1497
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,220
expensive on that one and all they're

1498
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,839
doing is making a bit of profit out of

1499
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,280
the Arbitrage and not adding any value

1500
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,559
and it isn't a very efficient market

1501
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,480
next slide

1502
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,960
cool so what we are trying to do to do

1503
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,760
this is to connect all of these networks

1504
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,980
right so as they are they're coming up

1505
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,319
at the moment some of them like Thomas

1506
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:27,119
said there are some bilateral Solutions

1507
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,740
there are some vendor and proprietary

1508
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,780
driven Solutions

1509
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:33,680
um and none of them really have any

1510
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,059
attempt at standardization really other

1511
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:38,160
than we will try and get as many users

1512
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,380
as possible and be the next eBay

1513
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,480
um what we want to see is a technically

1514
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,299
driven standard that allows anybody to

1515
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:47,579
connect to a more open network

1516
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:51,480
I think that is fine for that slide

1517
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,160
I will try and make up a little bit of

1518
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,279
time

1519
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,280
excellent so this is in terms of what

1520
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,140
are the things that we're talking about

1521
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,640
there's a few things that institutional

1522
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,200
tokenization is what I was talking about

1523
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,299
they have a lot of their own jargon in

1524
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:07,920
this world so issuance of interoperable

1525
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,500
digital assets I would like to sell my

1526
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,660
GPU on eBay and here is the data item

1527
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,040
that you will buy and which will give

1528
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,440
you the right to it that includes things

1529
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,540
like physical things like I said they're

1530
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:21,119
real estate gold it also includes money

1531
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,440
these days

1532
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,359
um and that's where cbdc's come in

1533
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:26,819
that's a token that doesn't get redeemed

1534
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:28,680
for anything and the variety of other

1535
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,240
tokenized money which is money that can

1536
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,240
be redeemed for things and we have a

1537
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,479
question

1538
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,559
my list of examples well this is

1539
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:41,460
probably a good time for a question yeah

1540
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,920
it's the slide so you mentioned earlier

1541
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,380
um that some of these assets um are on

1542
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,780
um you know blockchain type networks

1543
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:49,920
um so

1544
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,440
um uh is in order for that to work so

1545
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,460
because of the structures I understand

1546
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,020
it what that would mean is that the

1547
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,339
smart contracts associated with those

1548
01:01:56,339 --> 01:01:57,960
blockchains would have to require that

1549
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,339
we have to basically allow the gateway

1550
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:01,020
to override ownership

1551
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,839
no so in the project so not all of them

1552
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:05,900
will be on blockchain sure sure

1553
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,700
what the protocol needs is for the

1554
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,920
gateway to have some form of trust of

1555
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,900
the network and it when that's an

1556
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,940
implementer problem right so if it's a

1557
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,440
smart contract that provides a guarantee

1558
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,119
to it that's fine if it's something else

1559
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:20,460
that's fine as well so the trust

1560
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,660
relationship that we were talking about

1561
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,059
earlier the Gateway needs to trust the

1562
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:25,500
network and there will be a liability

1563
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,119
relationship between them and the

1564
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,380
gateways trust each other with this

1565
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,880
separate liability relationship so

1566
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,440
there's right but it's actually trust

1567
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,180
relationships right but in this case of

1568
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,380
the network trust in the Gateway so like

1569
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,059
I mean if if we're like getting nfts

1570
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:37,559
right then the way the nft will be

1571
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:39,180
constructed is that the Gateway has the

1572
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,799
power to take anybody's nft and just

1573
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,540
take it right correct okay thank you

1574
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:48,119
excellent cool so um we will come on to

1575
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:49,319
we talked about the size of the market

1576
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:51,720
well I didn't but the slide did um which

1577
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,299
is in the multi-millions low billions

1578
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:56,040
today expected to rise to trillions so

1579
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,500
some of the players in this area tend to

1580
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,839
be the large Global Banks

1581
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,359
um and which one was it Gilbert one

1582
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:04,440
though

1583
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,119
um

1584
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,880
starts with an S uh they have got a

1585
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,040
about 300 billion something like that

1586
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,599
their plan is in the next two years to

1587
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:14,099
tokenize all of the assets that they

1588
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:16,799
hold so security is everything so it's a

1589
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,380
it is a major Trend bny melon have put

1590
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,819
about 200 million into building

1591
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:22,380
platforms for this over the last couple

1592
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,640
of years

1593
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,440
um at Quant what we did

1594
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,960
um uh last month actually

1595
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,240
um we were in hackathon we implemented

1596
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,700
sapi in its draft form

1597
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,040
um so the hackathon was run by Swift

1598
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,420
um for those that don't know Swift is

1599
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,799
the uh

1600
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:39,839
Network it's an organization that's

1601
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,760
shared ownership organization so all the

1602
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,020
banks in the world own it it's got about

1603
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:47,339
22 000 owners they run across four uh

1604
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:49,200
highly redundant mpls networks they back

1605
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,220
off to a whole bunch of different

1606
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,660
providers they've got a lot of data

1607
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,400
centers and they provide highly

1608
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,680
resilient messaging services for the

1609
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,240
whole financial services industry

1610
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,599
basically they're also interested in

1611
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,880
this right so the hackathon had two

1612
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,559
things one was about custody didn't

1613
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,059
really care about that the other one was

1614
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:07,740
about interoperability between networks

1615
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,839
so we do care about that that's kind of

1616
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,220
what we do

1617
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,940
um they also have been running their own

1618
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,260
uh internal thing on this so they had

1619
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,280
their own announcement they've been

1620
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,780
doing interoperability between two

1621
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,220
different networks using Swift's

1622
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,720
infrastructure they've spent 10 months

1623
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,640
on that and that is their proprietary

1624
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,799
one built around their message set for

1625
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:27,660
this one it was more open

1626
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,280
um so we

1627
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,599
um the the comp piece on there is

1628
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:32,819
labeled Gateway and sapi is how we

1629
01:04:32,819 --> 01:04:34,559
connected these things and this was this

1630
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,359
one was two different networks

1631
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:38,280
representing effectively a source and a

1632
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,720
destination

1633
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,040
um the use case was around it was

1634
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,020
tokimo's gold there's a folks that are

1635
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,880
sitting on vaults full of gold who think

1636
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,559
we can tokenize this and we can use it

1637
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,119
as a currency and they are trying to do

1638
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:49,260
that so this is what they're trying to

1639
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,480
do in in that case

1640
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,520
um there's about 120 participants in it

1641
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,140
bny melon won it in the end because they

1642
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,460
throw a lot of money at it we would join

1643
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,319
third with NatWest

1644
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,819
um on that one so there's a lot of UK

1645
01:04:59,819 --> 01:05:01,200
Banks there's a lot of interest in this

1646
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,200
area so from a use case point of view I

1647
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,460
guess the message really here is that

1648
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,020
the industry is doing this and they're

1649
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,520
doing it at scale and they're doing it

1650
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,220
in a fairly proprietary format there are

1651
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,780
other standards groups out there that

1652
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,880
are not doing the protocol side so as

1653
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,380
Gilbert said ISO are doing terminology

1654
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,599
framework that sort of thing there's

1655
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:20,579
tons of projects that are think their

1656
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:22,079
way is the only way right so

1657
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,640
particularly in the blockchain world

1658
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,440
each of the camps think interoperability

1659
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,859
is everybody uses their system and we

1660
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:30,180
were at cybus last week which is the

1661
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,619
Swift conference which is roughly the

1662
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:33,780
size of RSA we spoke to a lot of people

1663
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,040
there

1664
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,720
um they are mostly holding off because

1665
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,339
there is no interoperability people are

1666
01:05:38,339 --> 01:05:40,020
doing a lot of Pilots a lot of pocs and

1667
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,940
they're waiting to see if there's a

1668
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,500
winner or if there's a standard piece of

1669
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,480
interoperability so there's a few people

1670
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,480
going live q1 at the moment but this is

1671
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,740
kind of this is what everyone's waiting

1672
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,359
for and it's the technical standard that

1673
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,640
we need

1674
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,339
okay any questions about this

1675
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:59,900
presentation any questions

1676
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:02,520
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a

1677
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,720
bad thing

1678
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,799
yes yes

1679
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,119
all right let's go

1680
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,540
to back to Thomas uh with the status

1681
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,700
report of what they have been doing for

1682
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:18,259
the past three months

1683
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:22,020
so uh we've taken a lot of input uh in

1684
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,539
since the last ITF in Philly and and

1685
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:26,220
we've been having basically weekly

1686
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,859
meetings on this so progress we've been

1687
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,480
documenting the assumptions because in

1688
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,700
fact that was the the big question I

1689
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,200
think coming out of field is what's the

1690
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,839
Assumption and we've been saying well

1691
01:06:36,839 --> 01:06:38,880
you know what we call phase phase zero

1692
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,619
what needs to happen before this flow

1693
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:43,319
runs so so been documenting that we've

1694
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,539
been collecting use cases we have a use

1695
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:48,599
cases document in fact uh you know we've

1696
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,640
got the digital dollar project GDP in

1697
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,260
Washington DC that's going to contribute

1698
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:55,140
text to our use case document I asked

1699
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,520
them to give me three paragraphs and

1700
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,099
they gave me four pages so my job is to

1701
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,960
sit down with them and and sort out

1702
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,520
through four pages you just need three

1703
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,839
paragraphs uh we've been working

1704
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:09,599
um on a the common message flow for the

1705
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,700
asset transfer so for those who are

1706
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,220
looking at um our GitHub there's a

1707
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,500
figures folder and there's a there's a

1708
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,480
flow diagram it's I think where the file

1709
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,140
it's like version 15. so so we've been

1710
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,700
talking about this probably since before

1711
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,260
Philly but since Philly we've been

1712
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,920
reading meeting weekly and as that

1713
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,720
particular message flow is is sort of

1714
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,819
the the sort of Highly discussed uh

1715
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:35,880
subject or topic of of our meeting we

1716
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,039
also have a draft Charter that that is

1717
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:41,280
is up available on our GitHub repo next

1718
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,339
next slide please thanks

1719
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:47,160
so so uh we finally got agreement among

1720
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,839
ourselves okay internal consensus that

1721
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:50,700
and you could just follow that that link

1722
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:54,900
there we want to focus on two key flows

1723
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,579
the first flow is that the asset

1724
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:58,859
transfer flow and the second one is the

1725
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:01,980
data sharing flow more completely asset

1726
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,140
related data sharing what I call data

1727
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,539
extraction and we have an architecture

1728
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:08,640
document and a use cases document as

1729
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,359
well

1730
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,180
I know it's ambitious we we're shooting

1731
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,640
for 18 months uh but I've been told

1732
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,219
that's super ambitious but okay

1733
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,380
put a put a line on the sinus at 18

1734
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:24,319
months uh next next slide please

1735
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:28,380
uh so prior to uh Philadelphia we would

1736
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,920
be meeting twice a month so it's a it

1737
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,660
was a biology bi-weekly meeting but

1738
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:36,299
since fairly we've been

1739
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:39,120
um doing weekly and personally I was I

1740
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,759
was surprised I was surprised people

1741
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,399
were willing to meet you know every week

1742
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,380
every Tuesday morning you know and some

1743
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,299
people some people like thank you Rama

1744
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:50,880
people in in India they were on like 8

1745
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,819
P.M you know and then and there's uh

1746
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:56,880
three guys in Australia and it's like 11

1747
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,698
p.m you know in Australia so they've

1748
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:01,560
been joining and I I kind of feel bad

1749
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,960
for the Australia crew and the and the

1750
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,060
India side but but this is kind of the

1751
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,640
rough stats and and uh it's just it's

1752
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,859
just Excel and I just cut and paste

1753
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:13,080
Excel but on average it's it's about 10

1754
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,939
attendees which is you know I thought

1755
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:16,979
about this pretty good right uh you'll

1756
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:18,899
see some dips there um at the end of

1757
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:20,399
August you know when you know had like

1758
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,839
five people and that was because it's

1759
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,420
vacation season last last chance for a

1760
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:28,080
vacation before um before September it's

1761
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,880
open to all the zoom is recorded so you

1762
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,520
can you know go back uh you know uh to

1763
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,140
this and the links on the mailing list I

1764
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,759
can go back and listen to the zoom

1765
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,679
recording

1766
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,979
uh next slide please uh so so people ask

1767
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:42,299
well how come you don't have like you

1768
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:44,520
know gazillion mail items I guess you

1769
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,179
know

1770
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:47,399
it's because we we use the zoom session

1771
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,738
we talk about stuff uh you know and

1772
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:51,120
that's why we're recorded I know it's

1773
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,140
not

1774
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,238
um sort of ITF tradition to be the

1775
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:56,400
recording Zoom uh I personally think

1776
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,739
it's for me going over start having the

1777
01:09:58,739 --> 01:10:00,900
zoom recording has been great I mean

1778
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,460
sometimes I have to like put in the

1779
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,739
mid-ins or fix fix the notes and having

1780
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:06,360
the zoom recording kind of helps you

1781
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,860
know remember what what I said what

1782
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,900
other people said

1783
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,300
um next slide please

1784
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,940
uh so the set of assumptions we have a

1785
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:16,199
thread there on the mailing list you can

1786
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:17,100
have a look at that we've been

1787
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,540
collecting this and this is I said

1788
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:19,920
earlier there was a question earlier

1789
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,260
about the assumptions we've grouped them

1790
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,300
into three categories all of them are

1791
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,880
are out of scope but but we know it

1792
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,980
needs to happen so legal framework side

1793
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,020
what is the asset definition what's an

1794
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:32,880
asset and in different networks in

1795
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,320
different Industries it might be

1796
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,780
different an entity I we don't do

1797
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,640
identity management when we don't want

1798
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,800
to do anti-money laundering and all that

1799
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,540
stuff that's that's out of scope for us

1800
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,600
but that's kind of and if if anyone has

1801
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,480
in an additional sort of assumptions

1802
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,219
that we think we need to add to this

1803
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:52,500
we're very open because we can't solve

1804
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,420
The World's problem we just been doing

1805
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,739
doing the yellow bit in the middle

1806
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,500
so I also get this question a lot like

1807
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,020
why the idea well I my my wine liner is

1808
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,340
that it's the home of interoperability

1809
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:07,380
right so this is where this is number

1810
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,360
one number two you know technical review

1811
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,000
so like guys like Ecker right so you

1812
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,320
know they're gonna they're gonna

1813
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,480
scrutinize our specs which is good I

1814
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,060
would prefer to have our drafts uh to be

1815
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,219
scrutinized locally instead of having

1816
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:23,159
you know mistakes uh in the draft and so

1817
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:25,800
on uh and you know we did

1818
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,380
um we did look at other organizations so

1819
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:31,440
we looked at that w3c they're primarily

1820
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,719
concerned right now about the verifiable

1821
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:35,760
credentials the VC data structures and

1822
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,280
the did so so we kind of said let's

1823
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,980
let's try it here first ISO as you heard

1824
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,679
from Gilbert is is a pretty high level

1825
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,320
organization they don't really do

1826
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,920
protocol specs right so so I did

1827
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,659
probably to explain

1828
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:53,460
um there's a lot of Open Source projects

1829
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,199
out there but I have to say to many of

1830
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,940
those open source projects

1831
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:59,640
running code is not spec

1832
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,440
right if you go to organizations like

1833
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,920
Swift so I was in 12 for example in uh

1834
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,020
you know in the cable open cable

1835
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,080
industry when they say a spec they were

1836
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,179
written specification that members have

1837
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:14,520
to implement and they might have to hire

1838
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,560
somebody to test compliance of the

1839
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,719
implementation right so so this is

1840
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,820
another reason why the itf.hf has a

1841
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,580
history of writing specifications in

1842
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,100
like in paper specifications yes we need

1843
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,140
running code we know that but you know

1844
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,420
more importantly nowadays I need to

1845
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:32,580
explain to many people we want written

1846
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,380
specifications

1847
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:37,199
uh next slide

1848
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,659
so active supporters uh I've grouped

1849
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:42,540
them into you know ID and O implementing

1850
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,520
testing deploying many of those

1851
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,300
organizations say this is great

1852
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,980
you know when there's a working group

1853
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,260
we're going to come and join right so so

1854
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,480
this is a to me it's a chicken and egg

1855
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,640
problem right so on one hand we have to

1856
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,620
show to you guys here that we have a lot

1857
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,480
of you know people interested but on the

1858
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,800
other hand they say well look hey you

1859
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,900
know why should I send my you know chief

1860
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,880
of innovation to a meeting in IHF and

1861
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,900
we're not going to get a working group

1862
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,060
so it's a it's a chicken and egg problem

1863
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,280
but however having said that there are

1864
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,900
people implementing this stuff you heard

1865
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,159
Pont

1866
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,219
um at MIT we're beginning to do an open

1867
01:13:17,219 --> 01:13:19,260
source implementation just of the yellow

1868
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:20,940
bit so it's probably just going to be a

1869
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,040
client server thing no no real Gateway

1870
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,159
uh compelio's doing one on the inter

1871
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,840
side you have I mean trade land and

1872
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,820
trade lens and mercks they have this

1873
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,620
deployed okay it's a proprietary Network

1874
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,780
and that was this the Second Use case

1875
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:36,480
this is running operating I know this

1876
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,300
personally because I've been helping

1877
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,280
with our project I grew up at MIT has

1878
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,020
been working with the government of

1879
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,739
Australia in the port of Adelaide and

1880
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:48,780
they're a customer of trade lens and so

1881
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,100
they're interested in this in this

1882
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,620
ability to extract out the bill of

1883
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:55,080
lading so that the local bank Westpac

1884
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,000
bank or Commonwealth Bank can actually

1885
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,120
give give a loan to to the uh to the to

1886
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,860
the buyer have you been able to ask

1887
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,199
these people if they've been willing to

1888
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:06,380
interact to work within the ICF

1889
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,400
absolutely yeah they said like great

1890
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,820
yeah yeah some of them yes that's the

1891
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,699
people who brought us tcpip and ipsec

1892
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:17,640
and TLS you know uh so yes they they

1893
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,520
actually would prefer the IHF because

1894
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,120
the ITF were not raising tokens when

1895
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,340
we're not trying to raise funds we write

1896
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,620
technical specifications we don't own a

1897
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:30,840
network the ITF is a perfect neutral

1898
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,159
entity

1899
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:33,360
thank you

1900
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,040
okay any any questions

1901
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,760
okay this looks like everybody needs

1902
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,280
coffee right so with none I'm going to

1903
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,540
go back to my chair slides

1904
01:14:49,739 --> 01:14:51,060
um so

1905
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,159
there's been a number of discussions I

1906
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:55,800
think uh the questions around the bill

1907
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,780
of lading and the more complex use case

1908
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,159
of how do you prove that you have

1909
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:01,020
something and you know that can be

1910
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,179
transferred later type of thing is is

1911
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:05,580
one discussion I heard

1912
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:09,360
um I think you know if there is still

1913
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,400
questions around

1914
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,719
um what Eric was talking about earlier

1915
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:15,960
of do we need to define the level of

1916
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:19,380
auditability or observability you know

1917
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,600
it that is important for this work to be

1918
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,980
considered we don't think we should

1919
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,780
solve any problems today right this is

1920
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:27,060
about to see if the IHF is the right

1921
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,880
place to solve that problem

1922
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,640
um so with that I guess what the

1923
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,920
questions I'd prefer to hear now

1924
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,620
are ones that are challenging in any of

1925
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,380
these statements right is the ATF the

1926
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:42,480
wrong place you know is the ATF the

1927
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,460
right place do the problems you know is

1928
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,020
this a problem that needs to be solved

1929
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,540
I'm not asking these questions yet in

1930
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,280
terms of a you know a hum type of

1931
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,460
approach but I'm wondering who who has

1932
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,320
challenges to you know the typical

1933
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,600
reasons why we hold Buffs right we hold

1934
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,940
Buffs to decide if if this working group

1935
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,580
should be formed and so I'm very curious

1936
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:04,679
if there are questions or comments

1937
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:07,199
related to whether or not it should be

1938
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,300
formed leave

1939
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,000
so it's maybe not a question but maybe

1940
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,699
something that might be missing and that

1941
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:17,880
is kind of what what are the overlaps um

1942
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,760
I actually came in here believing there

1943
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,159
were more overlaps than I I right now

1944
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:25,320
standing here I think this is kind of

1945
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,920
fairly well scoped even though there are

1946
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,159
some also some dangerous sort of aspects

1947
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:33,980
to this I mean the the stuff Eric

1948
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:37,500
pointed out that your the gateways are

1949
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,739
kind of in charge have to be right they

1950
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:42,480
they have rights to do stuff in the

1951
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,800
networks

1952
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,360
um that that's a dangerous thing to have

1953
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,340
around but it it's a fairly well skilled

1954
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:51,060
problem for all of that right so I I

1955
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:55,040
what I would add to that is you know you

1956
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,199
there needs to be a little bit better

1957
01:16:58,199 --> 01:17:01,500
coordination among the

1958
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,300
um working groups and and efforts in the

1959
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,280
iitf that work on stuff related to

1960
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,860
digitalization of assets and that

1961
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:10,440
involves Tigris that involves uh skit

1962
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,060
that involves

1963
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,699
um something like this right

1964
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:16,800
um and that that's not an argument

1965
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,900
against doing anything right but it's an

1966
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,300
argument for making sure that you're

1967
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,699
tightly scoping whatever you're doing in

1968
01:17:23,699 --> 01:17:26,159
this working group yeah so to

1969
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,320
specifically the use case where the user

1970
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,179
is not approving stuff

1971
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:32,159
I think that's kind of what I gleaned

1972
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,199
from Eric's statement the user isn't

1973
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:37,199
necessarily approving the transfer the

1974
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,420
Gateway is and that's a that's a

1975
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,219
significant difference between this and

1976
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:43,080
and tigers where the user is

1977
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,120
specifically in charge

1978
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,400
um anyway not not quite true actually in

1979
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,199
our flow diagram you see that Alice

1980
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,199
actually says to the Gateway do this so

1981
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:54,120
yeah but that's uh that's us that

1982
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,699
signaling it doesn't necessarily make it

1983
01:17:56,699 --> 01:17:58,500
part of the protocol well so what are

1984
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,420
the assumptions right Thomas is that the

1985
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:03,060
the Gateway has a lock on the asset

1986
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:05,820
before the process before doing a lock

1987
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:07,920
it has to be commanded instructed by

1988
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,380
Alice the the asset how that happens in

1989
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,100
each Network yeah we can't we can say

1990
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,080
correct there correct yeah all right

1991
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,460
thank you leaf

1992
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:20,340
uh Eric so this is like

1993
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:21,540
I'm not sure if it's a commentary

1994
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,280
question but

1995
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,659
um uh

1996
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:28,140
on so I I as I was last time I am very

1997
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,219
concerned about our confidence is all

1998
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:31,500
this problem I'm concerned about our uh

1999
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,159
um

2000
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:35,040
our uh pipeline into the people who

2001
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,080
actually are the consumers of this

2002
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,239
um so I saw a number of companies on

2003
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:41,400
that slide I don't see most of them here

2004
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,620
where are you from

2005
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,840
okay how many people in that so if we go

2006
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,800
back to that slide how many people

2007
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,320
actually actually deploy shipping are on

2008
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,239
this slide

2009
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:53,640
or actually here

2010
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:57,000
I'm serious like what I said how many

2011
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,159
people who are not selling this solution

2012
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:01,500
but are consumers the solution are

2013
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,699
actually here in this business in this

2014
01:19:02,699 --> 01:19:04,820
room

2015
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:08,820
so so I kind of I invited so the Swift

2016
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,620
guys came to Philadelphia they're back

2017
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,900
up the room so so I it's too much for me

2018
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,000
to ask for Swift to send two people to

2019
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,520
two ITF meetings it's not too no it is

2020
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,980
not no that this is exactly my point

2021
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,080
exactly as I said last time Eric I I

2022
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,600
can't bring the first question is Philly

2023
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,400
you said bring in the developers so I

2024
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,780
said I can't bring everybody and then

2025
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,280
having said that you asked the second

2026
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,320
question bring me all the consumers you

2027
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,520
know this is a chicken and egg program

2028
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:37,080
so so no no no no when when we like

2029
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:41,520
I'm sorry we ordinarily go and we

2030
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,739
and and we Charter something we Charter

2031
01:19:43,739 --> 01:19:46,140
under the assumption that the people who

2032
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,120
are the relevant people the people who

2033
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,340
you say you don't want to come

2034
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,659
will be in the room and you're claiming

2035
01:19:51,659 --> 01:19:52,860
they're going to show up eventually but

2036
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,480
I'm saying they need to shop now and if

2037
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,800
they can't be bothered they can't be

2038
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,900
bothered even to call in then actually

2039
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,040
no I think that is like a really

2040
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,840
reconcerting sign for our ability to

2041
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,040
actually understand what the

2042
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,239
requirements are after we reflect them

2043
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:05,760
and so to have like so and have that and

2044
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,080
like I've learned lots of percenters or

2045
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,280
people kind of like tried to remote

2046
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,780
control this through like either three

2047
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,280
people I could talk to and they talk to

2048
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,500
everybody else and like and we always

2049
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,580
tell people this isn't going to work and

2050
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:16,199
I've tried it doesn't work so I want to

2051
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:16,860
make sure that we actually have the

2052
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,659
right constituency room and I don't

2053
01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:19,920
think there's a reason why so Eric thank

2054
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,780
you I think your comment is very valid

2055
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,159
right you have to have the people that

2056
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:24,659
are willing to do the work and Thomas

2057
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:26,400
talked about there are people willing

2058
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,380
now I think one of the questions I can

2059
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:30,300
put into the final closing questions for

2060
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,520
you is because we have to include the

2061
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,380
remote people right so if there are

2062
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:36,420
people remote and and you know I didn't

2063
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,560
ask the question in a way that they

2064
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,420
could raise their hand I can add that

2065
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:41,040
question toward the end so that we do

2066
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,659
get a better account of who in the room

2067
01:20:42,659 --> 01:20:44,940
might be implementing deploying or you

2068
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,320
know whatever I think that's a very

2069
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,360
valid question for whether the buff you

2070
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,659
know should succeed or not uh

2071
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:53,760
Ramen so Wes I want to help you with Q

2072
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,560
management I have a new thread so if

2073
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,940
anyone wants to talk about the old

2074
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:59,219
thread I will yield

2075
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:02,000
thank you very much

2076
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,380
disagree with you Eric I think it's a

2077
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,600
little bit unfair too

2078
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,260
um

2079
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,060
um characterize

2080
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:12,719
um the turnout as weak uh if that is

2081
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:15,780
what you're doing I think it's it's fair

2082
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:19,140
um for a new effort in a in a in a group

2083
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:22,080
that is new for most other companies

2084
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,500
involved I think having at least some of

2085
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,739
them on on site is

2086
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:29,580
um

2087
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:32,580
maybe not perfect but it's definitely an

2088
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:34,679
indication that there is interest

2089
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:37,320
and certainly the the level of dialogue

2090
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,420
that has happened weekly uh including

2091
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:41,280
mail messages you know is a decent

2092
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,199
amount of people who they represent I

2093
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,400
don't know I'll leave that to the answer

2094
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,960
but go ahead

2095
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,080
thank you from broadcom so yeah I would

2096
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:52,199
like to uh support the the point made by

2097
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:54,900
uh Thomas about the difficulty to hire

2098
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,600
people in standardization even forget

2099
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,159
the ietf for a second uh there is a lot

2100
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:04,560
of work going elsewhere about the lack

2101
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,780
of Industry engagement the big

2102
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:10,020
difficulty we find is that when you need

2103
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,780
to make the case as a developer as an

2104
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,060
engineer as other people to participate

2105
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,440
you need to have the buy-in from your

2106
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,219
management

2107
01:22:17,219 --> 01:22:19,980
most of the western companies are

2108
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:22,620
clueless about standardization there is

2109
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,300
another person who mentioned a very good

2110
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,980
point that

2111
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,980
open source is not specifications that's

2112
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:31,260
a very good point people have the

2113
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,060
impression if you do open source that's

2114
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,159
good enough no

2115
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,320
and a lot of the companies don't get

2116
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,239
that point either so for them if you

2117
01:22:39,239 --> 01:22:40,860
tell them I need to open an open source

2118
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,719
project yes I need to go to

2119
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:46,199
personalization why cost money your

2120
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:48,060
trips or time you're not going to spend

2121
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:52,020
on on doing your day life job etc etc it

2122
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:54,420
is extremely difficult not that people

2123
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,219
are not reading but they have to fight

2124
01:22:56,219 --> 01:22:58,860
the fight constantly and even when this

2125
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,900
is established when you tell them we not

2126
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:03,420
get results before years

2127
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:06,060
this is just inaudible for the

2128
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,400
management of most of the companies so I

2129
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,260
understand the prime of qualifying an

2130
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,820
acre is right in the sense we have to

2131
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,320
make sure that we have enough critical

2132
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,600
mass I completely understand that but we

2133
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,760
have to be careful about how we manage

2134
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,380
the situations otherwise we will never

2135
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,179
start anything anymore all right thank

2136
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:23,159
you uh The Government Can I suggest you

2137
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:24,540
turn off your video when you're not

2138
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:26,460
actively speaking only because the QR

2139
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,620
code disappears when you're and so about

2140
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:29,940
four people just walked in the room I

2141
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:31,679
want to make sure people can uh can

2142
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:33,960
properly register so the QR codes

2143
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,300
Roman nelio Carnegie Mellon University I

2144
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,179
turned off my video uh

2145
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:40,860
so I I've got in a sense kind of a

2146
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,540
scoping question I heard a number of

2147
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:45,060
kind of use cases some felt very

2148
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:47,280
different than the other use cases so I

2149
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,040
wasn't clear to me whether one supports

2150
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,060
the other they're they're kind of

2151
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,739
parallel so this kind of made me kind of

2152
01:23:52,739 --> 01:23:55,020
step back is there an MVP a minimal

2153
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:57,480
viable product we have and are some of

2154
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,260
these

2155
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:00,179
you know to spin up the MVP we need it

2156
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:01,679
and others are things that we could

2157
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:03,360
maybe defer kind of later and we could

2158
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,580
get some clarity by focusing on kind of

2159
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,620
Base things that we work on and then

2160
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,239
assuming we're successful there we could

2161
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:11,400
do kind of additional work so I'm not

2162
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,719
sure whether yeah well things are

2163
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,280
separate let me add to that before I

2164
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,239
think you're going to get an answer

2165
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:16,380
which is

2166
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,659
can we defer the bill of lading problem

2167
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:22,219
to or later item

2168
01:24:22,219 --> 01:24:24,900
uh that would excite me I mean that

2169
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,460
certainly is one that did not feel like

2170
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,900
the others but I'm not sure how

2171
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,460
separable things are and it'd be great

2172
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,679
to have that kind of conversation yeah

2173
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,800
so the answer is yes the MVP is pretty

2174
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,179
much what we did for the hackathon which

2175
01:24:36,179 --> 01:24:37,920
was the asset transfer side of things

2176
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,140
based on the drafts that we have at the

2177
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:41,880
moment so that that's that's code that's

2178
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,860
been done so that that would be the MVP

2179
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:47,219
by definition at the moment okay uh Leaf

2180
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:48,540
is

2181
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:49,800
foreign

2182
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,760
okay Gilbert

2183
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,800
I I didn't register online uh should I

2184
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,920
go but first uh you can go first if

2185
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,020
Gilbert's okay with it but yes uh I'm

2186
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:02,760
Luke Riley from Quan I just had a couple

2187
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,679
of points to make about um the trust

2188
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:06,300
assumption because I think there's been

2189
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,640
a few comments on this and I just wanted

2190
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,520
to say why I believe it is good to have

2191
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,380
it so I think some speakers have

2192
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,000
mentioned that

2193
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,179
um the Gateway as we presented

2194
01:25:17,179 --> 01:25:20,219
represents previous uh distributed

2195
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:22,020
networks and obviously there's been a

2196
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,400
lot of work on that and proven

2197
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,620
technology but now we're moving it into

2198
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,020
the environments where you know the the

2199
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,719
networkers will read write and own

2200
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:33,480
uh and secondly if you remove the trust

2201
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,940
assumption you start to go down a rabbit

2202
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:38,940
hole of decentralization and you want to

2203
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:39,659
think

2204
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:41,820
who is who are we actually going to now

2205
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:44,340
trust and there's a famous paper famous

2206
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,980
to me uh in the DLT interoperability

2207
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:50,540
space where there is no complete

2208
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:52,800
decentralization you can ever can never

2209
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,980
have a complete decentralized network if

2210
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:58,560
I give you analogy for similar reasons

2211
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,840
to why communism wasn't work as soon as

2212
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,699
you're completely decentralized no one's

2213
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:05,040
motivated to do anything

2214
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,060
um so

2215
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:07,500
lots of people have been trying

2216
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,120
different ways of experimenting

2217
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,280
decentralization and if you read the

2218
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,260
news about blockchain networks you'll

2219
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:14,699
see that lots of the asset transfer

2220
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:17,699
protocols have major hacks cost loads of

2221
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:18,420
money

2222
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:21,000
big problems so that's why the two

2223
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,440
points why I think keeping the trust

2224
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,900
assumption is a good thing in this

2225
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:25,920
protocol

2226
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,600
thank you

2227
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,120
Gilbert thank you um I'd just like to

2228
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:34,260
just Express a uh I guess an opinion of

2229
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:38,040
what I've seen and comparing ITF to when

2230
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:41,219
ISO tc307 started it was less than 10

2231
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:43,620
people who started the initiative in

2232
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:46,860
2015 there was a year worth of uh work

2233
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:49,199
up front to to create the technical

2234
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:52,020
committee and it actually started with a

2235
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:54,380
group smaller than this so I'm really

2236
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:57,540
excited and surprised that there's so

2237
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,760
much uh initiative behind what's

2238
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,280
happening with this potential buff and

2239
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,980
with what's happening within iitf and I

2240
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,480
would like to just you know cast your

2241
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,820
minds two three years from now if you

2242
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:12,060
look at the the rate of of tc307 there's

2243
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,520
over a thousand plus subject matter

2244
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,739
experts across seven different working

2245
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:19,260
groups across 57 countries working on it

2246
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:22,199
so yes there's a representation of about

2247
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:24,960
65 plus whatever in the room today about

2248
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,540
100 but this could lead to something

2249
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,400
much bigger because we're here as an

2250
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,219
engineering task force is what the ITF

2251
01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:34,320
is to work on these Solutions together

2252
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,239
over the next few years and doing it as

2253
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,940
an RFC is the right way to do it it's

2254
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:41,280
collaborative it's open and you don't

2255
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,500
have to go through lots of rigor to

2256
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,080
participate it's quite a an accelerated

2257
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,960
way to to bring this engineering work

2258
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,820
out into Market which is quite exciting

2259
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:52,500
thank you thank you yeah I see some

2260
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,120
nodding heads on that

2261
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:58,020
um it to me it seems that if this works

2262
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:01,139
if this work goes forward it is likely a

2263
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:02,580
lot of this work will be done in interim

2264
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,780
meetings based on how it's been

2265
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:05,580
conducted so far and it's actually more

2266
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,380
likely that there'll be monthly interim

2267
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:10,020
meanings now uh just for for the people

2268
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,820
that don't know the ietf process in our

2269
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,260
meetings do have to be announced so far

2270
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,820
ahead and they can't be too close to

2271
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:16,199
ietf meaning there's a bunch of rules

2272
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:17,760
that you will have to start following

2273
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,739
you know other than that but there is

2274
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:20,820
nothing wrong

2275
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,040
um I don't think in the IHF to do things

2276
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,540
in interim meetings or technically

2277
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,460
always over the mailing list I don't

2278
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,659
think we found any working groups that

2279
01:28:27,659 --> 01:28:29,400
head above and then like never had a

2280
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:30,840
meeting but still got stuff done but

2281
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:33,719
that doesn't that it couldn't be done so

2282
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:36,600
okay any other comments before I will go

2283
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,100
into

2284
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,840
other random stuff I have slides of

2285
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,340
Charter text if everybody wants to go

2286
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:42,540
back to sleep but I don't think that's

2287
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:43,500
the case

2288
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,360
but I will start asking questions soon

2289
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,080
but Alyssa

2290
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,940
thanks Alyssa Cooper

2291
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:59,820
um I do think it's typical to look at

2292
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:00,900
the charter

2293
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,340
so I was going to ask you if that was

2294
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,380
going to happen or not

2295
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:07,679
um I was just looking at it and um

2296
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,300
there are I guess a couple questions

2297
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,460
well really just one question about this

2298
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:13,620
which is that

2299
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,480
um it seems to be missing the

2300
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,940
articulation of the threat model

2301
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,040
I don't know where that would land but

2302
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,020
it to me that that seems very important

2303
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,880
for this work

2304
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,500
um because there's a lot of talk about

2305
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,540
assumptions and there's I understand

2306
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:30,659
there's things being left out of scope

2307
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:33,540
um to simplify the problem space but a

2308
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,159
lot of the threats are derived from

2309
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:36,840
those things being that are out of scope

2310
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,280
so

2311
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,100
um uh I just feel like that is something

2312
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,199
that needs needs to be part of this no I

2313
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,300
think that is a fantastic point that but

2314
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,760
I would defer that until you know a

2315
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,440
working item to develop that threat

2316
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,420
model is is if if I was in charge which

2317
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:53,280
I'm not right I'm just the buff chair

2318
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,199
but that's not something that we would

2319
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,719
have to have totally isolated today that

2320
01:29:57,719 --> 01:29:59,400
oh no agree I'm just saying like there's

2321
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,800
Milestones listed but it's it's

2322
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,840
yeah so at least I didn't see it yeah

2323
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,040
you're right there are there are

2324
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,480
milestones and there is not a threat

2325
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,460
model on that Milestone I I suspect that

2326
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,560
the proponents would not be object to

2327
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,300
adding that to the I'm seeing lots of

2328
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,520
knotting heads yeah okay

2329
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,320
the other thing just to come back on

2330
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,540
like who you know who is here to to

2331
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,940
speak about this it's to me it's not I'm

2332
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,699
familiar with ISO and uh I don't think

2333
01:30:23,699 --> 01:30:25,860
actually comparing to ISO is valuable

2334
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,020
when you come to the idea

2335
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:30,780
um it's more about like the the types of

2336
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:32,940
participants and what their respective

2337
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:35,219
roles are in the system so

2338
01:30:35,219 --> 01:30:36,179
um

2339
01:30:36,179 --> 01:30:38,340
you know sometimes you get like all the

2340
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:39,719
people who are there who have a

2341
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:42,360
particular slant on the problem and that

2342
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,219
colors the design

2343
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:47,340
um if if you do have the consumers the

2344
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:49,679
asset networks if they're not there

2345
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,239
um but they're the ones who are meant to

2346
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:54,060
technically be the beneficiaries of this

2347
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:56,580
um but all you get are those who are

2348
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,900
representing those interests but not

2349
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,580
those interests themselves then I think

2350
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,920
that can be a bad situation and I say

2351
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,820
this as I think the ad who um oversaw

2352
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,400
the inter-ledger buff that we had some

2353
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,620
years ago um which which very much had

2354
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,060
that problem like

2355
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:15,600
um people who had only one uh vested

2356
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,159
interest who are trying to trying to

2357
01:31:17,159 --> 01:31:18,480
pitch this

2358
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,560
um so I don't think it's about the

2359
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,060
number of people who show up I think

2360
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,620
it's about

2361
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,480
um all the entities that are meant to

2362
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,340
interact in the system being represented

2363
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,080
in the design process

2364
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,320
okay thank you leaf

2365
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,580
right

2366
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:37,080
um that goes to my point of why

2367
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,219
um it might be a little bit different

2368
01:31:38,219 --> 01:31:39,900
now because we have all of these other

2369
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,540
efforts in the iitf where some of those

2370
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:45,120
groups are actually present

2371
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,159
um the software supply chain people yes

2372
01:31:47,159 --> 01:31:50,159
it's scoped to software but it's kind of

2373
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:52,380
it I think there's more

2374
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:53,639
um

2375
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:54,420
um

2376
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:56,400
there's more critical mass in the

2377
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,560
organization now than there was at the

2378
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,960
time when when you were chartering the

2379
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,480
inter-ledger thing those were the only

2380
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,580
people there who was working on similar

2381
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:06,719
things

2382
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:09,060
um I think there's a better chance

2383
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,739
thank you Raymond

2384
01:32:10,739 --> 01:32:12,840
uh Romanian Carnegie Mellon University

2385
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,840
no hat to finesse what I was asking

2386
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,520
earlier about the separability of the

2387
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,900
use cases in the poll a little bit on

2388
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:21,060
what Alyssa was talking about so I

2389
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,760
initially was saying MVP so the question

2390
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,460
would be typically you have an MVP we

2391
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:28,020
heard folks are willing to implement

2392
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:31,020
that who validates that it's the MVP and

2393
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:32,400
that would suggest to me the people that

2394
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,020
want to adopt it are going to run it or

2395
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,360
can say yes indeed those engineering it

2396
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,699
you hit the mark for us so it'd be you

2397
01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:39,900
know I don't know who that is but it

2398
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,480
might be nice to have them here but also

2399
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,580
I guess the one way to ask that in the

2400
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,320
flip side is anybody that doesn't think

2401
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,080
that the digital asset transfer aspect

2402
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,900
of the problems statements is should not

2403
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:53,460
be the MVP because I think that's the

2404
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,340
consensus please get in the queue

2405
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:59,520
if you disagree with what I just said

2406
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,560
hey uh Ori Steele

2407
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,480
um transmute um

2408
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:07,260
just to because I heard the analogy to

2409
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:10,320
some software the skit working group and

2410
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,300
the software use cases

2411
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,920
um and over the past couple days there's

2412
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,580
actually been several ietf uh um

2413
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:20,400
groups that exist where they had a very

2414
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,920
narrowly defined initial Charter and

2415
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:25,139
they've built very great generic

2416
01:33:25,139 --> 01:33:27,840
building blocks and they're talking

2417
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,239
about a re-chartering process for some

2418
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:32,460
of their you know more extended use

2419
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:35,820
cases and so I you know just saying that

2420
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:37,800
you know when we formed um skit we

2421
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,840
talked a lot about hardware and and

2422
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,420
physical supply chain use cases and we

2423
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:44,040
specifically focused on the software

2424
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,659
supply chain use cases but the building

2425
01:33:45,659 --> 01:33:47,699
blocks that we've been designing are

2426
01:33:47,699 --> 01:33:49,980
with the awareness and engagement from

2427
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:51,840
community members who are you know

2428
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,280
following those other use cases as well

2429
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,719
and I think it's very relevant to this

2430
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:56,760
and have seen Echoes of that in suit and

2431
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,860
teeth as well and if anyone else would

2432
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,540
like to sort of comment on how how

2433
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:02,159
that's gone in those other groups I

2434
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,780
think that could be helpful uh you know

2435
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:06,000
for this group thanks agree particularly

2436
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,520
the the data sharing what I call the the

2437
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,199
data extraction thing because they have

2438
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:11,699
the same problem that if you have a

2439
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:13,920
private you know supply chain and

2440
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,360
there's somebody outside and you want to

2441
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,460
extract information so yeah

2442
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:19,920
and by the way this leads to failure of

2443
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,980
architecture in the IHF when we kind of

2444
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:25,679
scope very narrowly in order to kind of

2445
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,139
get our deliverables in and then we

2446
01:34:28,139 --> 01:34:30,840
build gener for for a more much more

2447
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,659
generic building blocks and then we tend

2448
01:34:33,659 --> 01:34:36,799
to duplicate efforts

2449
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:43,020
okay with uh

2450
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:45,500
yep so um

2451
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:49,080
so I have a question first so because

2452
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,179
it's like 25 years I've not been in a

2453
01:34:51,179 --> 01:34:55,320
buff meeting so uh when when when you

2454
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,179
create that do you are you doing some

2455
01:34:57,179 --> 01:34:59,699
kind of Gap analysis versus other sdos

2456
01:34:59,699 --> 01:35:02,400
because I I heard the iso was mentioned

2457
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,860
uh but there might be other groups that

2458
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:07,560
are working on connected pieces to that

2459
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,540
and like I just can't believe that that

2460
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:12,060
it would be only here is this part of

2461
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:14,639
the of the analysis to prepare to

2462
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:17,460
prepare a working uh above or

2463
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,679
so I'll let Thomas answer that or

2464
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,580
somebody else yeah

2465
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:27,840
so yes early on we looked at uh itu ISO

2466
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,080
IEEE w3c and a couple of others in terms

2467
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:33,120
of what they were doing but also what

2468
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,860
level they were working at before we

2469
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,659
settled on ITF because it's the it is

2470
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:37,980
the interoperability protocol between

2471
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:40,139
the gateways and the other absolutely

2472
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:42,420
other other folks are dealing on

2473
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:44,699
different layers of the same process to

2474
01:35:44,699 --> 01:35:45,900
get the whole business process working

2475
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,239
when I asked the proponents why the ietf

2476
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:50,580
a month you know or two ago they were

2477
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:52,739
overwhelmingly because it is the easiest

2478
01:35:52,739 --> 01:35:54,780
place for membership to participate in

2479
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:56,400
because there's not fees there's not

2480
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,080
joining requirements there's not all the

2481
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,520
other things and it's an open

2482
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,100
specification so it made sense to me oh

2483
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,679
it was not meaning that it was just

2484
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:09,179
about the inter sdos coordination uh so

2485
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:11,940
when when we let's assume we create the

2486
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,739
working group is there liaison statement

2487
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:18,300
sent to to other sdos about that yeah

2488
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:20,340
or invite them

2489
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:21,659
yeah

2490
01:36:21,659 --> 01:36:23,400
it's just a question because I am

2491
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,920
another Stu's I'm just mindful about not

2492
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,540
duplication of work but as well

2493
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:30,300
collaboration that's fair and so one of

2494
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:32,340
the questions we'll ask in a minute is

2495
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:34,260
is the aetf the right place to solve

2496
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:35,580
this problem but I have another question

2497
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:37,980
preceding that but let's just speak

2498
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:38,940
first

2499
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:41,159
just related point that usually we have

2500
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:42,840
in the charter of the other groups that

2501
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,400
this group will liaise with and this

2502
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,460
Charter doesn't have any of that so

2503
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:48,719
that's probably something especially if

2504
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:49,860
you're going to reuse the terminology

2505
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:52,320
for myself my bad the previous version

2506
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,540
had a whole bunch of Institutions my bad

2507
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:56,520
yeah well no it's not institutions as

2508
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,800
other other standards organizations or

2509
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,360
things like that or I mean other working

2510
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,100
groups if it sounds like there's going

2511
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:05,760
to be coordination with skit or whatever

2512
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,380
um to me the charter editing needs to

2513
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,360
happen after we get an agreement that

2514
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:12,060
there should be a charter so there's uh

2515
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:13,620
steps go ahead yeah you should say that

2516
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,840
was the the point behind my question is

2517
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,600
I was not seeing any any reference to

2518
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:22,020
other works just yeah we can do

2519
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,880
certainly do that and also within stuff

2520
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:27,120
within the um the ATF as well

2521
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,840
Gilbert

2522
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:32,639
um just on that point uh in the European

2523
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,040
commission we have an annual kind of

2524
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,860
Standards check-in so we've got IEEE itu

2525
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:40,800
T ISO open source even commercial

2526
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,080
entities coming and they present the

2527
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,699
work that everyone is doing especially

2528
01:37:44,699 --> 01:37:47,100
in this space and that's a way where we

2529
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,600
can actually check notes and and

2530
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,280
understand what's progressed in

2531
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,020
different areas and what we shouldn't

2532
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:53,580
reinvent because if it's already been

2533
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:55,560
done in one standards body wire

2534
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,840
reinvented that that's coming up by the

2535
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,460
end of the year so if if there's an

2536
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:02,580
opportunity we can represent ITF in that

2537
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:05,580
Workshop to Showcase what the thinking

2538
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:08,280
is in ITF and then also understand what

2539
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,480
all the other standards what is it doing

2540
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:12,060
at the same time so with my IAB hat on

2541
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,639
you know we run uh we are responsible

2542
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,320
for the the internet architecture board

2543
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:17,820
that's responsible for reaching out to

2544
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:19,320
other standards organizations where

2545
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,760
there is overlap and we need

2546
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,980
communication to avoid duplication and

2547
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,600
things like that in agreement

2548
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,400
um that is something the AV is is more

2549
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,840
than willing to take on if if this

2550
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,340
actually brings in

2551
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:32,040
new groups that we that the ietf needs

2552
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,900
to associate with there's absolutely a

2553
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,760
path to make that happen so that's that

2554
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,500
the formal Liaisons that can be

2555
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,139
established exactly yeah we have a whole

2556
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:42,659
process related

2557
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:45,000
all right with that

2558
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,600
um

2559
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,100
I am

2560
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,080
and chairs you not at me if I'm heading

2561
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,179
the right direction here but my thinking

2562
01:38:51,179 --> 01:38:53,219
is there are two aspects to the

2563
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:55,440
discussion today the first is

2564
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,560
this a problem that that needs to be

2565
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,440
solved and that is independent of is the

2566
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,719
IHF the right place to solve it you know

2567
01:39:03,719 --> 01:39:06,120
is it do we have the the resources here

2568
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:08,219
to do it so I'm gonna ask the first one

2569
01:39:08,219 --> 01:39:10,139
first which is and I'm going to

2570
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:13,679
constrain it to just the the data asset

2571
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,239
transfer so I think the wording I'm

2572
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:17,520
going to use is I believe so this is as

2573
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,159
if you were voting right I believe that

2574
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,440
the problem of data asset transfers is a

2575
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,000
problem that needs to be solved

2576
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,620
somewhere

2577
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,420
so the goal will be you will raise your

2578
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,980
hand if you think it's a problem you

2579
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,480
know that you understand well enough and

2580
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,000
that it needs to be solved and you will

2581
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,679
you know click the don't raise your hand

2582
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:36,060
if you actually disagree you don't think

2583
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:38,100
it should ever be solved anywhere

2584
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,840
if you're not sure then you don't touch

2585
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,659
anything does that make sense

2586
01:39:42,659 --> 01:39:45,080
John

2587
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,400
no

2588
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,679
oh no no so I'm I need to click on the

2589
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:50,820
button but I don't do it before

2590
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,679
explaining it because then we get into a

2591
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:54,540
whole debate of I collect at the wrong

2592
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:55,800
time

2593
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,199
so the poll is open so anybody that has

2594
01:39:58,199 --> 01:39:59,940
properly logged into the data tracker

2595
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:02,520
and uh you should be able to

2596
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:07,219
click raise or don't raise your hand

2597
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:10,500
for the for Dennis make sure we do take

2598
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,600
down notes once it sort of stops ticking

2599
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,960
upward

2600
01:40:32,699 --> 01:40:37,638
so give it a another 30 seconds or so

2601
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:44,060
foreign

2602
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:52,020
I think we'll call that good so for the

2603
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,480
for the note taker um there are 36

2604
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:57,719
raised hands and two do not raise Tans

2605
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:00,239
if the two the people that's that said

2606
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,920
you know functionally this is not a

2607
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,139
problem that should be solved uh if you

2608
01:41:04,139 --> 01:41:06,000
want to speak uh now is the time to join

2609
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,480
the cube

2610
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,940
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing her name

2611
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:16,020
right

2612
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:17,820
oh that was that was a raised hand

2613
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:18,960
problem okay

2614
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,300
do either of the uh two do not raise

2615
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:25,040
hands probably people want to speak

2616
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,860
okay

2617
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:31,260
uh so the next question I'm going to ask

2618
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:32,820
is

2619
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:35,460
this a problem

2620
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:37,980
a digital asset transfer problem

2621
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:40,679
is the digital

2622
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:43,460
asset

2623
01:41:52,619 --> 01:41:54,179
I actually had these written out ahead

2624
01:41:54,179 --> 01:41:55,860
of time but I'm changing the wording of

2625
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:59,659
course based on the discussion today

2626
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:10,020
so I think the way I'm going to word it

2627
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:13,800
is is the ietf the right place to create

2628
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:16,380
the digital asset transfer protocol

2629
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,119
so we've agreed that the problem needs

2630
01:42:18,119 --> 01:42:19,320
to be solved to be able to transfer a

2631
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:21,540
digital asset is the ietf the right

2632
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:24,420
venue to do that so you'd raise your

2633
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:26,639
hand if you believe it is the right

2634
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:29,280
venue and it should be done here

2635
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,560
um with all of our processes for working

2636
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,320
groups and things like that versus I

2637
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,400
actually think it should be done

2638
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,840
somewhere else I think there's strong

2639
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:38,340
consensus that should be solved there's

2640
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:40,260
a question of is the AHF the right place

2641
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:43,739
or you'd rather see it go somewhere else

2642
01:42:43,739 --> 01:42:47,299
don't raise your hand if you don't know

2643
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,420
and we do recognize our tools are a

2644
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:08,219
little weird with the do not raise hand

2645
01:43:08,219 --> 01:43:09,780
button that confuses the heck out of

2646
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:12,559
everybody that's new

2647
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:15,600
I am actively not participating that's

2648
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:19,040
that's really what that means

2649
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:33,199
I love seeing people change their minds

2650
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:36,780
okay so that is

2651
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:37,560
um

2652
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,239
that is

2653
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:41,400
pretty stable to where it was last time

2654
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,380
so uh we'll note for the minutes that

2655
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:45,000
there are 35 people that raise their

2656
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,580
hands and three that did not and I'm

2657
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:49,320
going to do the same thing as before for

2658
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,179
the three people that did not raise

2659
01:43:51,179 --> 01:43:53,040
their hands meaning you do not think it

2660
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:55,380
should be done here I'd like to hear and

2661
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:57,300
I'd love to hear your opinion

2662
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:58,619
um Richard Burns it looks like you're

2663
01:43:58,619 --> 01:44:01,619
first in the queue go for it

2664
01:44:01,619 --> 01:44:04,739
yeah hey um I

2665
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:08,100
I did not raise my hand for because that

2666
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,080
was my manifestation of the concerns

2667
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,880
that some we were talking about I think

2668
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,800
Ecker talked a while about about not

2669
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:15,600
having quite the right Community here

2670
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,400
where the right connections to the

2671
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:20,460
community of folks who would ship this

2672
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:22,980
so I'm not yet convinced of that

2673
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:24,840
okay can you before you leave can you

2674
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,460
characterize what you think the right

2675
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,199
Community is when you said you want the

2676
01:44:28,199 --> 01:44:29,639
right Community what would that

2677
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:33,139
manifestation look like

2678
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,699
I what I would like to be confident of

2679
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:37,800
is that you know if we develop something

2680
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,659
here we'll actually get usage

2681
01:44:39,659 --> 01:44:42,780
um and so you know I I think you know by

2682
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:44,699
analogy to the MLS case which I think as

2683
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:45,900
I could put it on the chat was like kind

2684
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,580
of the best case for a buffer we had you

2685
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:50,520
know a lot of of operators

2686
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,560
um uh

2687
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,119
you know in the room saying they wanted

2688
01:44:54,119 --> 01:44:56,880
this even though it was a future thing

2689
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,560
um you know what I would like to see

2690
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,480
here is you know folks who are actually

2691
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,520
doing these sort of transfers you know

2692
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,619
moving assets around saying that you

2693
01:45:04,619 --> 01:45:06,000
know if a tool like this were available

2694
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,739
and it was a standard like it would help

2695
01:45:07,739 --> 01:45:08,880
them do their business better and they

2696
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,260
would be actually moving transactions

2697
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:11,820
over it

2698
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:14,100
so let me read the wording of the next

2699
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,080
one and I'll and Eric you can talk first

2700
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,940
of course but I'm sure the wording of

2701
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,320
the next question that I think I will do

2702
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:21,719
is I am a participant that will actively

2703
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:24,060
implement or deploy the results

2704
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:26,520
is that a fair answer to help you with

2705
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:27,719
that question

2706
01:45:27,719 --> 01:45:30,719
would be helpful sure okay so Eric go

2707
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,719
ahead yeah so I mean I I I I my concerns

2708
01:45:33,719 --> 01:45:34,440
really think the same ones are

2709
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:35,520
terrifically today but I'll try to

2710
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,659
sharpen what I would actually like to

2711
01:45:36,659 --> 01:45:38,760
see yep which is representatives of the

2712
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,500
networks of the of the networks that are

2713
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,119
being gatewayed in the scenario being

2714
01:45:42,119 --> 01:45:42,960
here

2715
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,420
because like there's a distinction

2716
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:46,800
between I and the person making the

2717
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,239
Gateway and I'm the people who are

2718
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:49,500
operating the networks now there's the

2719
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:50,699
people who are operating the networks of

2720
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:53,699
here okay so why not if there are here

2721
01:45:53,699 --> 01:45:55,260
fantastic if they're not here I'm like

2722
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:56,460
less happy

2723
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:59,699
all right so uh would it be satisfactory

2724
01:45:59,699 --> 01:46:01,380
for me then to split it into two

2725
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:03,119
questions one is

2726
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:06,420
you know Implement one is Implement and

2727
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,880
and the other being

2728
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,860
involved in the networks actually that

2729
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:12,600
will make use of it I need to work on

2730
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,219
the wording of that but that's sort of

2731
01:46:14,219 --> 01:46:16,460
the point

2732
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,020
be clear like I hear Thomas's point and

2733
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,659
if if if what the outcome is is that we

2734
01:46:24,659 --> 01:46:26,100
hear from those people in email later

2735
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:28,139
that they will appear and we'll even

2736
01:46:28,139 --> 01:46:29,880
review remotely that'd be great too like

2737
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:31,560
I understand that here that's fine like

2738
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,540
but like but like what I'd like to know

2739
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:35,219
I think that the isg when they go to

2740
01:46:35,219 --> 01:46:36,840
provision asks is our critical mass of

2741
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,040
those people are willing to hang out and

2742
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,960
participate in some fashion that's the

2743
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,800
question one question I'm really

2744
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,679
interested in no I think Eric your point

2745
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,960
is a thousand percent valid right that

2746
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:48,659
they're if you build it they may still

2747
01:46:48,659 --> 01:46:51,119
not come so we need a protocol that can

2748
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:53,100
both be built and you know people are

2749
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:54,480
willing to do the work to build the

2750
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,699
protocol but we also need people that

2751
01:46:56,699 --> 01:46:58,800
are actually going to use it to say you

2752
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,119
know this is not something that's just

2753
01:47:00,119 --> 01:47:02,159
going to be wasting paper I have an RFC

2754
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:04,320
that is only just now after like 10

2755
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,880
years people are starting to implement

2756
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,340
it's a very long time I'm glad that it's

2757
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,659
finally being implemented but it was

2758
01:47:09,659 --> 01:47:11,159
very depressing to me that it went 10

2759
01:47:11,159 --> 01:47:12,659
years without a single implementation

2760
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:14,520
and now it's actually going to be used

2761
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,860
by Major countries but go ahead I just

2762
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:18,119
like to challenge that question though

2763
01:47:18,119 --> 01:47:19,139
because

2764
01:47:19,139 --> 01:47:20,460
um don't quite understand understand why

2765
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:22,860
you need the network people to be

2766
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:24,480
present compared to the Gateway people

2767
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,820
because asset transfer is an application

2768
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:28,619
on top of the network you don't need

2769
01:47:28,619 --> 01:47:30,300
those node operators there something I

2770
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:31,560
did that question real quick before you

2771
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,840
answer Eric because it's relevant um

2772
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,480
the ATF does not attract operators that

2773
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,040
is a consistent problem that we

2774
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:41,159
continually have

2775
01:47:41,159 --> 01:47:42,199
yeah

2776
01:47:42,199 --> 01:47:45,360
basically like I always worry when I'm

2777
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,780
when I hear that when I hear that the

2778
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:50,580
people that are the only people that I'm

2779
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:51,900
talking to are the vendors or the

2780
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,940
vendors the alleged product that on this

2781
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:56,219
attention design so that's that's my

2782
01:47:56,219 --> 01:47:57,540
concern for exactly racing Wester said

2783
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:59,699
yeah I mean we have that problem like

2784
01:47:59,699 --> 01:48:01,920
everywhere in the ietf unfortunately and

2785
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,500
with some exceptions in the Ops area it

2786
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,540
does have a few implementations so all

2787
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:07,500
right so I'm going to start with the

2788
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,719
first question of I am a participant

2789
01:48:09,719 --> 01:48:11,520
that will actively implement or deploy

2790
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,320
the results and we'll dive into later

2791
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,060
are you a Gateway or are you actually

2792
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:17,520
part of a network that that'll be second

2793
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,400
to this other question

2794
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,920
so raise your hand if you are actively

2795
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:26,040
you know planning on implementing or

2796
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:29,060
deploying the results

2797
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:33,719
do not raise hand means I am not going

2798
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:35,699
to actively implement or deploy the

2799
01:48:35,699 --> 01:48:39,000
results so yeah I know but it comes

2800
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,679
ahead I'm actually more interested in

2801
01:48:40,679 --> 01:48:42,239
the raised hands right so I think that

2802
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,100
the do not raise hands is less valuable

2803
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:46,380
in this particular you know result

2804
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:48,300
because it's not like you're actively

2805
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:49,860
going to prohibit other people from

2806
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:51,780
doing so right

2807
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:54,119
Roman you have a clarific clarifying

2808
01:48:54,119 --> 01:48:56,239
point

2809
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:59,540
he'll let the poll finish okay

2810
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:06,719
so as I said the the raw numbers of

2811
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:08,400
actively raising hands seem more

2812
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,320
interesting and that that um it'll be

2813
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,000
the number of people that are planning

2814
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,639
on implementing or deploying

2815
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,380
um the other people might be Security

2816
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:18,060
Experts here that have nothing no ties

2817
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:20,280
to ever actually using the protocol that

2818
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,900
doesn't mean they won't help develop it

2819
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:25,400
because it was clear that they're worse

2820
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,000
all right I think we'll call that good

2821
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,400
so there are 12

2822
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,679
11.

2823
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:35,520
11 12 darn it uh 12 people that have

2824
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,560
indicated they will you know actively

2825
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:39,900
implement or deploy the results and then

2826
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:43,139
there are 19 that are uh bystanders and

2827
01:49:43,139 --> 01:49:46,860
participants of observation and protocol

2828
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:49,139
developers so

2829
01:49:49,139 --> 01:49:52,500
if possible would be super to unpack the

2830
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,960
12 there with I believe tremas's second

2831
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,360
or third slide that use the I and D

2832
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,159
annotation because I think there were

2833
01:49:59,159 --> 01:50:01,560
less than 12 on that list so that means

2834
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:03,239
more people are saying they're going to

2835
01:50:03,239 --> 01:50:05,659
implement and deploy

2836
01:50:05,659 --> 01:50:09,080
interesting okay

2837
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,100
I mean just practically I'm just trying

2838
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:12,360
to understand who are those people if

2839
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:13,800
they want to I mean you were the chair

2840
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,060
but if they want to come to a mic that

2841
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:16,260
would be super if they would tell us or

2842
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:17,820
drop it in can I jabber or is this

2843
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,320
double counting you know we have

2844
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:20,760
multiple Representatives which is great

2845
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:23,159
right I mean we're doing an open source

2846
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:26,820
simple one at MIT just client server not

2847
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:30,000
not just the middle bit yeah yeah I'm

2848
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,060
already there

2849
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:34,980
all right so so Roman I I did not say

2850
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:36,600
only one organization you know one

2851
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,920
person favorite organization May

2852
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,300
representative

2853
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:42,980
uh venkat Ramen uh your first

2854
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:46,560
uh

2855
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:52,860
a lot of people who want uh who are

2856
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:56,460
running networks they try to instead of

2857
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:58,380
going towards the standard body right

2858
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:00,600
away they try to seek out projects that

2859
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,460
are working on interoperability so I can

2860
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:05,460
give you an example last year we solved

2861
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:07,320
an interoperability or set of

2862
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:09,780
improbability scenarios for the bank of

2863
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:11,460
France and Agility who are trying to

2864
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:13,860
implement several asset exchange and as

2865
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:15,420
a transfer use cases across their

2866
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:17,100
different networks and these networks

2867
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:17,940
are built on different kind of

2868
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:20,219
Technologies like hypology Fabric and

2869
01:51:20,219 --> 01:51:24,119
God and so they talked about their

2870
01:51:24,119 --> 01:51:26,100
experience and the experimental

2871
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:28,739
successes in the recent hypology global

2872
01:51:28,739 --> 01:51:30,300
forum if anybody is interested there are

2873
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:33,600
recordings available online so what I'm

2874
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,639
trying to say is that people first try

2875
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:38,460
to it's a stakeholders people are

2876
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:40,320
running networks first try to seek out

2877
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,719
Solutions experiment with them and then

2878
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,460
the kind of people who are providing

2879
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:46,679
Solutions like like we are doing we are

2880
01:51:46,679 --> 01:51:48,780
maintaining the flagship

2881
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:49,980
interoperability project under

2882
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:53,040
hyperledger time we are the ones who are

2883
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:54,239
participating in the standards

2884
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:56,520
activities so that we can take these

2885
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,260
lessons and make sure that the solutions

2886
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:00,179
we providing to those companies are

2887
01:52:00,179 --> 01:52:02,460
implying with the standards

2888
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:04,020
yeah thank you

2889
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:05,820
John

2890
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:09,780
yeah I'm John robot I'm I'm the CTO of a

2891
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:13,260
team in ey that builds

2892
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:15,179
um you know distributed data sharing

2893
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:19,619
Solutions and blockchain solutions

2894
01:52:19,619 --> 01:52:22,020
um that's why I've been participating in

2895
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:23,219
this

2896
01:52:23,219 --> 01:52:25,860
um you'll see in the slide above you

2897
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:28,199
know the early on that we were

2898
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:30,719
registered as an observer that's because

2899
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:35,219
ey is this enormous organization in

2900
01:52:35,219 --> 01:52:38,400
getting the approval to say that ey is

2901
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,560
more than an observer would probably

2902
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:43,500
take me the next two to three years yeah

2903
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:46,500
that's that's always a problem too so

2904
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,080
um one last

2905
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:51,239
interest question before we we need to

2906
01:52:51,239 --> 01:52:53,699
start to begin wrapping up and I want to

2907
01:52:53,699 --> 01:52:55,619
give the 80s a chance to to give final

2908
01:52:55,619 --> 01:52:58,860
things but uh based on Eric's suggestion

2909
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:00,360
of wanting to know are there actual

2910
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,159
operators of asset networks that will

2911
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,320
use the protocol that is the next

2912
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,300
question so it is I am an operator of an

2913
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:07,920
asset Network that will use the SAT

2914
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,080
protocol so raise your hand if you are

2915
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,239
an operator of a network and I as I said

2916
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:13,920
we recognize that we don't attract many

2917
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,219
operators please be honest here in terms

2918
01:53:17,219 --> 01:53:19,080
of you know you really must be running

2919
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:22,100
one of these Networks

2920
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,119
we're going to ignore the do not raise

2921
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:28,280
hands count because it's not relevant

2922
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:37,880
age

2923
01:53:39,659 --> 01:53:42,500
uh

2924
01:53:45,179 --> 01:53:47,520
we've had one or two but that's a good

2925
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,699
point

2926
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:54,000
all right so I think we'll call that

2927
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,800
good there it looks like there are four

2928
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:57,540
uh people that have indicated they

2929
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:58,560
actually

2930
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,420
um run networks

2931
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:02,280
um we've heard from a one or two at

2932
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:04,199
least as including some that can't

2933
01:54:04,199 --> 01:54:06,960
actually say it yet uh if any of those

2934
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:08,760
four were willing to come to the mic and

2935
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:11,820
just explain your particular network if

2936
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:14,100
you're able to we recognize uh there's

2937
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:15,659
legal applications of speaking for your

2938
01:54:15,659 --> 01:54:17,760
company that may not be handled yet

2939
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:20,219
five so we'll count it five total for

2940
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:21,179
the vote

2941
01:54:21,179 --> 01:54:23,699
for we're back to four

2942
01:54:23,699 --> 01:54:26,178
Luke

2943
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:31,350
[Laughter]

2944
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:34,380
okay

2945
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:38,239
um so

2946
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,500
nobody has raised their hands

2947
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:43,139
unfortunately so I I think one of the

2948
01:54:43,139 --> 01:54:44,760
things that we should ask Thomas and his

2949
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:47,340
crew to do is potentially see if we can

2950
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:49,619
actually get real operators to to get to

2951
01:54:49,619 --> 01:54:52,380
provide a list of people that actually

2952
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:54,540
say that they will deploy it if it's um

2953
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:57,960
as I said we don't attract operators

2954
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:58,619
um

2955
01:54:58,619 --> 01:55:01,080
with that I think that the the only

2956
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:03,300
other questions that I needed to ask

2957
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,699
were the typical review and edit type

2958
01:55:05,699 --> 01:55:07,320
questions is that sufficient for you

2959
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,699
guys

2960
01:55:08,699 --> 01:55:11,000
anything else

2961
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:16,320
okay so let's do I am willing to help

2962
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:19,860
review documents

2963
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:25,739
review read you know participate in the

2964
01:55:25,739 --> 01:55:27,840
list be an active participant but

2965
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,340
reviewing documents is the key part

2966
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:30,719
which is why we don't say just show up

2967
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:32,219
at the meetings we need you to actually

2968
01:55:32,219 --> 01:55:36,139
read the documents and critique so

2969
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:37,920
um in interest of time I'm going to cut

2970
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:40,760
this off pretty quickly

2971
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:51,119
all right let's call that good at at 28

2972
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:53,760
just in the interest of time

2973
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,100
I am

2974
01:55:56,100 --> 01:56:00,179
will help edit an author documents

2975
01:56:00,179 --> 01:56:02,280
so this is for editors and authors we

2976
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:06,239
should not have 28 okay we don't need 28

2977
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:08,100
authors that is not going to happen so

2978
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:09,659
we need a few but if you're willing to

2979
01:56:09,659 --> 01:56:12,420
actually do the active role of editing

2980
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:13,860
and authoring a document and taking

2981
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:15,600
contributions and texts from people and

2982
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:17,760
massaging it into the text

2983
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:19,820
um

2984
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:22,980
then I I know we have some people doing

2985
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:25,940
that already so

2986
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:34,260
and there's a bunch of people that say

2987
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:37,880
that they will actively oppose editing

2988
01:56:39,179 --> 01:56:41,040
I I think we'll call that good that's 12

2989
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,320
which seems actually like too many

2990
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:46,440
anyway so um we'll call that good at

2991
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:48,300
this point 80s

2992
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,739
um we did not get the editing the

2993
01:56:49,739 --> 01:56:51,360
charter that does not surprise me we did

2994
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,400
get a good couple of good comments um

2995
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,440
that we will take back and the

2996
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,600
proponents can add things like uh

2997
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:59,940
interoperability liaison ships to other

2998
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:03,900
organizations as well as a security

2999
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:04,619
um

3000
01:57:04,619 --> 01:57:06,480
uh what's I'm blanking on the right

3001
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:07,860
wording but but looking at this

3002
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:09,540
producing a document that talks about

3003
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:11,100
the threat model

3004
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:12,659
um so I think that that will be added to

3005
01:57:12,659 --> 01:57:14,580
the goals the charter is fairly long so

3006
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:16,560
I didn't think we'd get to it today

3007
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,060
um but it would be helpful it is online

3008
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:19,980
it's on GitHub one of the slides

3009
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:22,320
actually has a reference to it

3010
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:26,460
um so please uh do review it and um

3011
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:28,260
I will let the ads have their secret

3012
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:32,659
conference and then they can speak

3013
01:57:41,099 --> 01:57:43,280
okay

3014
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:50,760
one of you has to talk

3015
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:52,920
I don't care which

3016
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:54,540
you can even use this microphone if you

3017
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:56,719
want

3018
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:02,040
okay

3019
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:03,179
um

3020
01:58:03,179 --> 01:58:06,000
so so clearly there's a lot of digest

3021
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:06,780
here

3022
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:08,820
um I think we will take it back and we

3023
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:11,639
will do some some long discussions

3024
01:58:11,639 --> 01:58:15,420
um there's it doesn't seem to be like an

3025
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:17,340
obvious solution one way or the other or

3026
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,860
sorry it doesn't seem to be a very

3027
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:22,260
obvious outcome it's a it's an

3028
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:25,739
interesting complicated problem that we

3029
01:58:25,739 --> 01:58:30,080
will need to uh think about deeply

3030
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,020
one of the things that the the

3031
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:35,520
leadership was talking about the other

3032
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,679
day is that it's not obvious at the end

3033
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:40,500
of a buff what the outcome is and and I

3034
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,179
I need to apologize for the leadership

3035
01:58:42,179 --> 01:58:44,340
that we don't do that well we take it

3036
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:46,320
back we think about it and it's not at

3037
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,360
the end of the at a buff everybody knows

3038
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:49,560
the working group is going to happen or

3039
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:51,599
it's been rejected that's uh there's

3040
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:53,460
discussions that happen afterwards and

3041
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:55,980
you know uh that's definitely I think

3042
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:57,900
what was happening here as well so don't

3043
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:00,420
take this as a negative sign that or a

3044
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:02,520
positive sign for that matter

3045
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,380
um because the discussions happen later

3046
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:06,360
in the week and in leadership

3047
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:08,639
discussions at the aesg in the next you

3048
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:10,139
know couple of weeks

3049
01:59:10,139 --> 01:59:11,520
um unfortunately what that means for

3050
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,020
usually people in the room is they leave

3051
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:15,239
a little confused and that's just how

3052
01:59:15,239 --> 01:59:17,520
the process works but there will be a

3053
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:19,440
answer and it will be posted to the SAT

3054
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:22,020
mailing list once the 80s have

3055
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:23,940
determined where to go from here sure

3056
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:25,560
and if we're talking process it's also

3057
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:27,300
worth kind of recognizing that this is

3058
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:29,880
just part of the ietf community and buff

3059
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:31,500
is an input to the process but we also

3060
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,360
use the robust mailing list that we're

3061
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,560
trying to kind of build to help us

3062
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:35,760
reason through that and we would check

3063
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,560
any consensus we would find there as

3064
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:39,119
well

3065
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:40,619
yep

3066
01:59:40,619 --> 01:59:43,860
uh any I think I won't ask for any

3067
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:45,119
additional questions because we are

3068
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:47,820
exactly at time so I ran it perfectly to

3069
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:50,159
the line and that is always the goal

3070
01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:52,020
uh thank you all for participating I

3071
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:53,159
actually found it a fascinating

3072
01:59:53,159 --> 01:59:54,900
discussion I see where there's work that

3073
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,360
needs to be done and where it's actually

3074
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:59,099
somewhat decided so um I think there's

3075
01:59:59,099 --> 02:00:00,599
decent progress here one way or another

3076
02:00:00,599 --> 02:00:03,500
thank you all for coming

3077
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:05,699
yeah and also just want to thank

3078
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:07,500
everybody for for putting in this this

3079
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,599
you know a lot of time and coming here

3080
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:11,760
and efforts and also especially West for

3081
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,159
for doing a really good job of being a

3082
02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:15,659
very objective

3083
02:00:15,659 --> 02:00:17,880
outside of the process person doing the

3084
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:20,280
process guiding without any stake in the

3085
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:22,930
game it's really appreciated

3086
02:00:22,930 --> 02:00:27,909
