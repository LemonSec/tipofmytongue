1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,500
I'm sure he's around

2
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,780
all right

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,720
well it's time

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,580
so let's go

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,220
hey everybody welcome to this tiny

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,140
little kellex session in in a room

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,640
that's slightly too big for us but I

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,840
think this might be the smallest room

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,040
they had anyway

10
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,079
thanks Daniel with a giant head that's

11
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,640
bigger than mine on the on the wall over

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,739
there you look huge they've got a huge

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,840
screen for you

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,120
maximum smile

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,680
I put together some very very short

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,620
slides here basically welcome this is

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,360
calex if this is where you want to be

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,980
good

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,739
um this is the note well all of this

20
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,960
applies to everything you do this week

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,120
at IHF whether you're in the room or

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,559
remotely

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,899
um I'm sure you have read it if not

24
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,960
please do and Obey all the instructions

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
therein

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,640
this is the agenda that I've put

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,380
together based on what people have asked

28
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,100
for

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,640
so we don't need to stick to this but

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,320
this is the guide for what we want to

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,640
look at

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,880
um as Mike appeared in the queue he has

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,979
not

34
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,560
so it's subscription upgrade is Max

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,439
document it is in last call

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,400
um

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,820
but it turns out hello Mike welcome uh

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,320
just talking about subscription upgrade

39
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,340
which is

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,520
in last call it's it's you're the author

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,119
on it it has a section in it which is

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,460
still outstanding questions that have

43
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,439
am I not loud enough I feel really loud

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,299
thank you

45
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,020
um

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,479
yeah outstanding questions that that are

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,100
not yet resolved in there which probably

48
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,140
should be sorted out before we send it

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,119
to ASG or they will ask me questions

50
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,040
about my shepherding skills

51
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,600
so

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,679
um what do you want to do about that

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,640
do you want to pop in the Q mark

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,599
can you hear us

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
I'm only caught the tail end of what you

56
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,420
were saying what was it there

57
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,580
so the subscription upgrade document is

58
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,080
sitting there

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,319
um it's gone no comments on it but it

60
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,300
has a outstanding questions to be

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,220
resolved and so when I went to write the

62
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,560
shepherd's statement earlier he's going

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,360
to have some questions for me

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,459
I think that was um yeah that was a

65
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,560
result of the question of a conversation

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,420
between

67
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,140
um

68
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,440
me and Ken and we I think we just needed

69
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,019
to look at the spec

70
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,780
um to see what was valid for the very

71
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,420
header it's it's really just a matter of

72
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,440
making sure we got it right

73
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,180
all right um

74
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,700
I guess we could we could clear that up

75
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,980
in the you know when we get a it's

76
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,360
really just about getting the spec out

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,480
and looking through it

78
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,739
didn't get it wrong because I think we

79
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:32,760
were

80
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,860
doing it based on our recollection

81
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,780
rather than

82
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,379
um

83
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,220
proper reading cut

84
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,019
so it's not there's nothing there's

85
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:43,940
nothing

86
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,680
Beyond making sure we have the actual

87
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,440
statement correct cool um there's also

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,239
there was a must not where the knot

89
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,060
wasn't capitalized and the must was that

90
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,379
we've got um so how about I will

91
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,599
um send you a quick review

92
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,500
uh-huh and then you can fix the couple

93
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,480
of things and then I'll send off to ASG

94
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,280
yeah yeah

95
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,840
um that that'll do it because honestly

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,819
there's nothing nothing awkward about

97
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,140
the very thing it was just making sure

98
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,720
we had it right yep

99
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,000
cool all right that sound good to

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,120
everybody

101
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,660
fantastic

102
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,540
all right next thing on our agenda

103
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,600
is JS calendar and Friends Robert if you

104
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,060
want to pop up here I'll switch out the

105
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,220
slides

106
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,400
foreign

107
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,139
so um

108
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,940
JS Kell in the next slide please

109
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,720
so the the last month's

110
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,080
um with GS calendar have been

111
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,100
um

112
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,220
all about the scheduling model to use in

113
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,860
JS calendar we found discrepancies

114
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,080
between the JS calendar and the I

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,479
calendar schedule new models and um had

116
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,940
a couple of discussions both at ITF

117
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,880
sessions and um on the mailing list what

118
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,820
to do about it we had an interim uh at

119
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,800
the end of September uh where the

120
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,699
decision was made that we go with the JS

121
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,639
calendar model

122
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,880
and now we need to make this work with

123
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,500
Iceland and itip in the sense that um we

124
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,660
we obviously need to stay Backward

125
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,340
Compatible

126
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,100
um with calendaring services that just

127
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,039
speak I calendar and the current

128
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,280
um I calendar model but we want to add

129
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,919
new properties and definitions for both

130
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,020
I can and it to

131
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,860
um also make the JS calendar specific

132
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,539
scheduling

133
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,300
um model aware in I calendar for

134
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,199
implementations that might support both

135
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,580
um

136
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,300
another thing is that um in the on my

137
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,100
next presentation I talk about GS

138
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,380
contact but this also is relevant in so

139
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,800
far with JS calendar as Chase contact is

140
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,300
very likely to

141
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,820
um get published before we land JS

142
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,740
calendar Biz

143
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,419
um and um

144
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,580
obviously we want to reuse as many

145
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,479
common definitions um between these two

146
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,300
um so I also say here please review JS

147
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,259
contact

148
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,720
UM it includes quite a number of stuff

149
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,960
that we also want to do for JS calendar

150
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,759
and JS calendar and I calendar

151
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,800
conversion namely how to convert unknown

152
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,199
GS calendar properties how to convert

153
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,360
unknown eye calendar properties and

154
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,060
preserve them in Gs calendar

155
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,520
um also localizations are a thing that

156
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,620
we share between both

157
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,419
um so you'll see a couple of places

158
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,479
where uh they are highly relevant for GS

159
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,460
calendar too

160
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,259
um and we need implementations and

161
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,400
reviewers

162
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,220
um the uh discussion the last months has

163
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,060
been

164
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,120
um have been more or less between the

165
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,520
same four to five people

166
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,139
um it would be very great if you get

167
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,360
more reviews from the calendaring world

168
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,440
for JS calendar abyss and also if if

169
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,880
people are

170
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,740
um coming forward with their

171
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,300
implementations we can do more

172
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,720
interoperation testing before we land GS

173
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,580
calendar this

174
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,539
next slide please

175
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,940
so

176
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,520
some more some more information on the

177
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,759
scheduling so as I said before we now

178
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,340
defined what's required for GS calendar

179
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,120
the schedule ID property got added um

180
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,780
in JS Kell and Abyss over JS calendar

181
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,460
and that also changed the definitions of

182
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,160
Delegation and group memberships

183
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,699
um

184
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,919
this is now already in the in the latest

185
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,120
draft

186
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,220
um the main work currently is on

187
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,660
figuring out

188
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,020
how and where best to

189
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,800
um uh

190
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,680
convert this information into I calendar

191
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,300
um at the moment the idea would be to

192
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,879
extend the participant component that

193
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,860
got introduced in the event publishing

194
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,840
RFC

195
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,240
um so um that's also in the spirit that

196
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,879
I understand that we

197
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,960
mostly want to go forward with

198
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,599
participant and only keep the attendee

199
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,320
properties for backwards compatibility

200
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,240
for scheduling

201
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,380
um

202
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,140
that being said also this conversion is

203
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,060
not fully hashed out yet

204
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,920
um

205
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,660
so I think we need to look at it more

206
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,920
closely

207
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,000
um

208
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,480
it looks to me as there's there is some

209
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,339
heuristics and

210
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,399
and and and if this then that or else to

211
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,100
that rules and I generally do not like

212
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,880
them

213
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,980
um for conversions because these are

214
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,080
always the things that implementations

215
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,160
then

216
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,040
um could get wrong

217
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,300
um

218
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,700
and in combination with I calendar and

219
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,440
the latest after we have figured out how

220
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,360
to do that and I how to convert it in

221
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,339
Iceland we need to look at itip this

222
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,500
hasn't started at all

223
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,560
um I we definitely need to make sure

224
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,100
that um existing eye tip formal itip

225
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,100
rules still stay for backwards

226
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,959
compatibility and then we need to Define

227
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,820
how we can build on top of them so that

228
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,980
we can do more

229
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,560
um uh more scheduling for example using

230
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,580
server scheduling methods web scheduling

231
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,980
regular imip scheduling maybe other that

232
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,160
comes in a JS calendar extension

233
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,440
um yes and the backwards compatibility

234
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,779
as I said is is absolutely crucial to

235
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,760
make this work

236
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,660
next slide please

237
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,019
so these are the next steps that I see

238
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,140
um I think scheduling Will Keep Us busy

239
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,760
for a while

240
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,000
um also the mapping document

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,519
um I think I really would like to look

242
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,560
at the structure and organization of the

243
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
mapping document now that we've

244
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,940
basically done the same exercise for JS

245
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,560
contact

246
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,220
UM

247
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,580
it's at the moment Mike and I and I hope

248
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,560
Mike you are you agree with me on that

249
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,560
uh are are really bottlenecks on this

250
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,200
um Mike has a good bunch of other rfcs

251
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,420
to work on um I was

252
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,959
um almost completely busy in RFC work

253
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,320
with JS contact so if anyone would want

254
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,839
to join as a co-author please

255
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,660
please let let us know um I'd be very

256
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,700
happy to to share the effort with with

257
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,040
other people

258
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,760
um

259
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,180
so as a current distance I think it it

260
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,579
it's really it's realistic to aim for

261
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:03,720
the summer ITF in July uh for work

262
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,820
worker blast call that would be exactly

263
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,800
a year after we start a JS calendar

264
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,459
business which I would think is a is a

265
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,860
reasonable time frame if not I guess we

266
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,000
can discuss

267
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,800
um after my presentations that

268
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,779
presentation

269
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,100
um

270
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,440
now that being said I do know and that's

271
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,420
probably something that might need to

272
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,740
get addressed in the treatment working

273
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,500
group actually is that uh we already

274
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,180
have J map specifications waiting for JS

275
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,640
calendar this

276
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,920
um that's J map for calendars and chain

277
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,000
map for tests now

278
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,140
I I don't have a proposed how to deal

279
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,339
with this

280
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,680
um the differences between JS Kevin and

281
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,100
JS calendar base are not that big but

282
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,220
especially in terms of scheduling

283
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,200
um that got the

284
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,240
the rework that

285
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
the better should be taken into

286
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,500
consideration uh rather than now working

287
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,959
on the former or let's see current model

288
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,640
um that's the end of the my presentation

289
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,220
for JS calendar so I'm happy to start

290
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,079
any discussion about it

291
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,440
I was just going to um extend

292
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,660
um you know getting people to help with

293
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,500
the um uh the the the the mapping drift

294
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,839
I mean the the biggest part of that I

295
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,640
think is actually implementing the the

296
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,480
mapping and and simply noting what what

297
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,980
you do I mean it's it's hard to do it in

298
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,600
how to do and get it right if you don't

299
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,980
actually implement it

300
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,139
because some of the stuff we discovered

301
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,600
came about as a result of uh

302
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,980
implementing it and then running into

303
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,440
these roadblocks

304
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,680
um that needed resolving and we haven't

305
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,540
done any testing

306
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,160
um we could test between the two of us

307
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,899
and we get something closer to working

308
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,480
but we really need more people to

309
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,760
implement and and I think the rest of

310
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,959
the stuff will just fall out of that

311
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,920
yes I absolutely

312
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,540
have the same opinion

313
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,779
oh this is Ken from first Mill

314
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,760
um so I'll address two points so as far

315
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,160
as uh joining the effort I can certainly

316
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,740
take some of the implementation load off

317
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,320
of Robert's hands and I can certainly

318
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,220
also add to uh crafting some text as far

319
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,680
as the last point

320
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,959
um I see jmap is this a protocol and JS

321
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,820
calendar is the payload so I don't think

322
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,639
we necessarily need to hold jmap up

323
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,760
unless there's a change in this that

324
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,139
affects the protocol but I don't believe

325
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,760
that's the case

326
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,019
my

327
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,000
incorrect on that

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,700
no no I think the fact is

329
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,500
um all the testing I'm doing for the JS

330
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,339
counter conversion is is over caldev

331
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,160
um you don't need the protocol

332
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,500
I was referring to Robert's last point

333
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,399
about the jmap or if he's referred to JS

334
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,320
calendar and

335
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,360
um oh yeah and I would think I know they

336
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,279
blocked by our current work

337
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,860
oh so yeah the way around yeah

338
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,720
yeah and I I don't think they should be

339
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,940
blocked is my point no I don't think

340
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,959
they should

341
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,880
um because I think the same thing will

342
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,860
occur down the road I mean what if we

343
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,019
get another representation

344
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,420
um we're gonna throw J map away or are

345
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,920
you going to actually allow J map to

346
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,479
transport other representations

347
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,420
so um maybe let me clarify I do not

348
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,700
think that our um that they might be

349
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,579
blocked um by waiting for definitions

350
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,440
but um

351
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,560
these specifications are defined to they

352
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,260
refer actually to JS calendar now if

353
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,540
they get implemented and used

354
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,420
before GS calendar-based lens

355
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,839
um then we we need to deal with the fact

356
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,760
that there will be GS calendar data out

357
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,339
that is using the current JS calendar

358
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,180
scheduling model rather than the one we

359
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,800
are uh

360
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,420
um want to introduce with GS calendar

361
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,180
Biz which is not totally off but it's

362
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,420
different

363
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,260
so yeah I see this as an issue what you

364
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,579
just said

365
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,399
um potential issue but

366
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,420
um

367
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,240
at least for the tasks back I can say

368
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,320
that

369
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,420
it's probably not going to be complete

370
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,660
very soon so for that spec for the

371
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,699
specifics back it's right now I wouldn't

372
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,519
see it as an issue I would

373
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,100
more see this as like an issue we need

374
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,320
to track so you know like make sure that

375
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,660
JS calendar is somehow in the final

376
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,300
State before we finish

377
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,040
before we publish

378
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,680
jmap for calendars and gender tasks

379
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,000
probably

380
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,060
and to your third point I wanted to say

381
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,519
that we're right now implementing the

382
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,699
conversion spec for next cloud in both

383
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,680
directions actually

384
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,560
um so between I calendar and JS calendar

385
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,620
it's great to hear

386
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,860
I was going to uh say I mean the thought

387
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,199
on the last point is

388
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,800
um if you could express those

389
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,320
requirements in more abstract terms and

390
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,480
sort of more like a data model rather

391
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,360
than a specific representation that

392
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,459
might unblock things and also clear

393
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,300
things up for the future

394
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,000
yeah I mean I

395
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,139
I do think that if we do a change in JS

396
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,160
calendar this to the current definition

397
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,279
um we could even make this backwards

398
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,680
compatible with JS calendar and that

399
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,740
change would be that currently now

400
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,640
um in jsk and Abyss so in JS calendar if

401
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,679
you have if you delegate it to another

402
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,520
participant you use the good

403
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,819
it's a artificial identifier generated

404
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,220
in this JS calendar object for this

405
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,140
participant so it could be anything

406
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,000
basically

407
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,220
um in the

408
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,000
in the JS calendar this model we say

409
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,820
that you need to refer to the URI which

410
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,559
is the scheduled ID of another

411
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,660
participant

412
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,500
um

413
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,220
so

414
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,640
if we if relaxing the ruling J is

415
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,039
current Abyss that it can refer to

416
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,640
participant ID or a URI

417
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,360
um then then this could work and um a

418
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,120
participant ID can never be a URI

419
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,700
because it doesn't because the the

420
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,280
characters do not allow to be a

421
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,100
well-formed URI

422
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,220
but I guess we can visit this um

423
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,520
on the mailing list or or later in the

424
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,799
RFC

425
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,160
it um my mind does re-raise the issue

426
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,100
why we don't have a version number in JS

427
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,120
calendar

428
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,860
yeah that's actually something I wanted

429
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,440
to bring up for JS contact but um I I

430
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,059
would be happy to talk about it now for

431
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,940
GS calendar too I I suggested a while

432
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,059
ago and was told it wasn't necessary but

433
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:34,320
it would resolve some of these issues

434
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,120
and if you knew which version you were

435
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,280
talking about you could um

436
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,860
you could allow for these issues

437
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,480
um and it wouldn't have to necessarily

438
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,120
be backwards compatible

439
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,940
yes um incidentally yours and I just had

440
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,919
a chat exactly about this also before

441
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,480
this session

442
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,340
um and yes I agreed that a version

443
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,000
number uh that we use for handling

444
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,780
um

445
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,600
non backwards competitive changes is is

446
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,240
the way to go most most of the

447
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,640
specifications seem to use version

448
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,679
numbers we had a version number in I

449
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,360
calendar but of course the mistake we

450
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,580
made there was of never changing it so

451
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,280
nobody pays any attention to it

452
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
um

453
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,620
yeah so this this might be a good

454
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,480
argument that we

455
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,059
um look at versioning GSK and Abyss so

456
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,419
that we can then already start using JS

457
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,280
calendar but then implementations are

458
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,880
aware if they should upgrade or not yep

459
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,720
I think that is where we should go

460
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,039
yeah I just have one question

461
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,820
um is it the is it a problem that um

462
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,620
because if we say we're working group

463
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,860
classical in July is it a problem that

464
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,179
we wait for GS calendar Biz to stabilize

465
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,100
and then move to a gmap or

466
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,299
uh just that we'd like to get the jam up

467
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,860
stuff out at some point but no otherwise

468
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,299
waiting waiting works just means that we

469
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,760
won't have a spec that can be published

470
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,580
for another six months for Gemma

471
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,460
so it means too late yeah

472
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,760
and I'd say that given the

473
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,220
the small amount of testing that's taken

474
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,679
place it would make sense to wait

475
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,260
because it's almost certainly the case a

476
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,700
lot of issues are going to suddenly turn

477
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,980
up that hadn't been thought about

478
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,780
yeah and the reason why we haven't

479
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,400
shipped this at FastMail yet is because

480
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,919
it's not the Spec's not out yet so

481
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,140
we're we're

482
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,059
trying to save churning too much for our

483
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,799
production customers so they're still on

484
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,720
early versions of all of this yeah so I

485
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,299
mean testing would would certainly

486
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,120
reduce the the churn later on because uh

487
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,140
yeah

488
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,660
um so I think we need to push for

489
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,580
getting some testing

490
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,260
um done and not just two of us

491
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,320
or if we don't have any testing

492
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,660
um we can push to publish that and then

493
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,960
we we make sure that we're going to have

494
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,020
a gmabis

495
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,700
well yeah troubles people when they see

496
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,220
it or just just suck it up and and then

497
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,780
we're stuck

498
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:25,160
um yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I know yes

499
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,940
yeah so Charles bomb again

500
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,740
um I just want uh related to the

501
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,840
regarding the version

502
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
um number

503
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,140
um I don't see from it's probably just a

504
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,539
very simple key value thing um I would

505
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,179
assume so I don't see it hurting anyone

506
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,419
I would say but I don't see big need for

507
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,840
it neither but yeah probably I would

508
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,240
vote for

509
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,299
uh putting it in because probably

510
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,900
doesn't hurt

511
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,940
this one possibility is to use the at

512
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,679
type that's already in there and just

513
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,080
have a JS calendar to Jazz calendar

514
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,280
three

515
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,720
etc for the type so there's already a

516
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,159
place that we could do that that's like

517
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,659
a different thing

518
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,880
this the syntax doesn't matter much but

519
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,659
having a um a a version that gets

520
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,320
updated every time a a change this kind

521
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,280
gets made allows us to automatically

522
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,380
fire up converters and things between

523
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,140
versions or to Simply block something we

524
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,340
don't think is valid

525
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,059
this is Ken again so back to whether J

526
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,460
map should be blocked on on JS calendar

527
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,820
biss uh do we know are there any other

528
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,039
implementers out there waiting for the

529
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,140
gmf for calendar spec other than

530
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,460
FastMail

531
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,460
if not then I see no problem

532
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,760
waiting until this is is completed and

533
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,419
roll them all together

534
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
yeah it's just

535
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,640
not want to be able to publish it so

536
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,159
that other people can interrupt with and

537
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,260
we don't want to publish it with a pre

538
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,419
uh using the string when it hasn't yet

539
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,460
been right but to Daniel's point if we

540
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,960
publish early and we make a drastic

541
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,520
change in this that affects the protocol

542
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,620
now we're you know spinning out gmap

543
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,120
this yep

544
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,860
no I think waiting is the right so

545
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,600
don't worry don't bother asking if you

546
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,820
just talk regarding the ad type comment

547
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,820
uh yeah I think it makes a lot of sense

548
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,000
um I probably it's probably worse to

549
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,840
mention that this should be or May and

550
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,820
probably should be used for future

551
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,299
versions as a you you know new Js

552
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,159
contact or JS calendar

553
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,620
version should you use a different ad

554
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,640
type just like one sentence thing in the

555
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,820
spec

556
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,760
cool

557
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,020
so

558
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,520
Robert do you have everything you need

559
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,480
to go on here you've got yes Ken Ken's

560
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,640
offered to help you out yeah I called it

561
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,740
the writing we've got a timeline we I

562
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,179
think we've got an idea

563
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,200
Daryl go ahead

564
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,120
Daryl Miller Just one thought I just

565
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,380
happened to look at your media type

566
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,080
registration that says for this media

567
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,240
type your type has to be equal to this

568
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,100
value or this value or this value so if

569
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,900
you start putting versions in there you

570
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,880
technically need to go back and update

571
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,340
media time registration

572
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,500
it gets a bit messy

573
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,179
yeah thank you

574
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,360
um I'm not sure if we would even update

575
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,480
the media type we can't because we can

576
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,159
um

577
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,700
have more version granularity within the

578
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,280
within the Json data then we can just

579
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,880
put versioning for for sub objects not

580
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,220
the complete format but I yeah

581
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,840
but it does say in the media type

582
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,059
registration that the type parameter

583
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,640
must equal the value that is in the

584
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,700
payload so the wording currently says

585
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,340
you can't but okay yeah thank you we

586
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,080
need to consider that that sounds like a

587
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,539
suggestion in favor of a separate key a

588
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,220
separate version K as well as the type

589
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,120
as subtype key or something yeah

590
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,279
seems reasonable

591
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,000
okay cool

592
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,960
okay yeah so I I got all I need

593
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,220
cool

594
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,500
um so the action from that is

595
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,860
yeah

596
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,419
editing and my cool uh shall we move on

597
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:01,260
to the next one which is context let me

598
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,760
switch out the slides for you

599
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,059
John all right cheers contact

600
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,460
UM next slide please

601
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,840
so

602
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,860
we are complete we have um uh worked uh

603
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,460
the last weeks and um since last ITF um

604
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,039
on getting it all in shape I'm pretty

605
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,840
happy with the result

606
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,620
um

607
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,900
uh and um so we really look forward to

608
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,600
thorough reviews so that we can now

609
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,059
polish this thing

610
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:36,720
um

611
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,940
so um next slide please

612
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,400
who's summarizing a couple of changes

613
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,720
that we did there's a ton more but um we

614
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,960
um we we changed it the

615
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,360
time for the the date and time format

616
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,799
for anniversaries

617
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,600
um uh it's now

618
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,600
um a well-defined value in so far that

619
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
it's either a partial date or or it's a

620
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,299
timestamp so you do not need to look at

621
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,720
the uh the semantics if it's if it's

622
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,520
just partial or not does not come out of

623
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,559
the string format anymore it's indicated

624
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,980
by the type of the value

625
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,799
um we also split the resources property

626
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,159
which really was just a container for

627
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,260
basically any URI you can find in vCard

628
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,320
we split that into more specific

629
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,140
um subtypes as you see media

630
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,380
links crypto Keys calendars scheduling

631
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,200
addresses for scheduling addresses we

632
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,480
use the same we refer actually to JS

633
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,480
calendar to use the same scheduling

634
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,960
methods that being

635
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,900
imip and other as it currently stands so

636
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,840
uh so that we can Define

637
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,900
scheduling address is compatible in with

638
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,380
JS calendar in a JS contact

639
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,020
one of the things we also did was we we

640
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,500
removed the custom time zones in a JS

641
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,020
contact

642
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,940
we introduced them when we when we

643
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,200
sorted in a vCard you can have either an

644
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,720
Ayana time zone name for a time zone or

645
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,659
you can also just specify an offset

646
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,980
um and we initially introduced the JS

647
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,380
calendar time zone definition so that

648
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,960
one can put arbitrary time zones for

649
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,120
example the time zone that's that's just

650
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,559
using an OTC offset into the contact but

651
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,220
um we figure this actually

652
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,880
puts too much burden on implementations

653
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,419
that just want to implement GS contact

654
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:47,520
because they now need to implement their

655
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,480
own time zone parlors and evaluations

656
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,500
and stuff and um basically

657
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,960
we want to push people to use Ayana time

658
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,779
zones rather than fixed UTC offsets

659
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,539
which are even discouraged in the vCard

660
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,779
RFC so that's why we simplified the

661
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,960
model

662
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,959
um next slide please

663
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,419
um similarly a couple of Select changes

664
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,460
that we did to the conversion document

665
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,520
and the new vCard property and parameter

666
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,960
definitions

667
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,539
um we organized the conversion document

668
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,760
now so that it should look very familiar

669
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,320
to people

670
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,620
um being familiar with the vCard rfcs we

671
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,020
basically organize it's basically

672
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,299
organize the same you can so you can

673
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,460
have like the B card RFC and the

674
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,860
conversion RFC and they are basically

675
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,860
following the same line so it should be

676
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,940
straightforward to

677
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,640
um to write the conversions

678
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,159
um we also introduced the derived

679
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,340
parameter that might introduce in

680
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,760
um I think it's also event pop I'm not

681
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,480
sure anyway the derived parameter on a

682
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,299
property now indicates that this that

683
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,399
the value of this property actually is

684
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,799
derived by the implementation so it's

685
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:11,460
not a user defined value and so that so

686
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,340
implementations can know that this is

687
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,919
this is just kind of an ephemeral value

688
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,200
that actually can be generated from some

689
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,360
other information in the in the same um

690
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,700
cartilages in in this example and we

691
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,779
mainly use that for JS contact cards

692
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:34,440
that Define a name so having a name

693
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,260
defined in its several parts of the name

694
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,020
being the first name last name whatever

695
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,720
but in in a v card the full name

696
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,260
property is mandatory so now we use that

697
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,440
to generate a full name property from a

698
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,140
name and we tag the derived on it and

699
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,179
then this indicates to implementations

700
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:56,279
that they should basically just ignore

701
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,279
the full name property

702
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,380
uh we added a couple of other recalled

703
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,000
properties that mainly were just

704
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,500
required to map

705
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,039
um a couple of values from the uh from

706
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,360
JS contact

707
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,460
UM for pronouns specifically

708
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,059
um

709
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:16,080
we discussed our initial Proposal with

710
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,720
um with a couple of LGBT IQ activist

711
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,240
groups and it um it got refined a bit

712
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,760
but basically the the feedback was very

713
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,700
positive so um I hope we have

714
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,159
came up with something that's future

715
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,720
proof

716
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,279
um

717
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,220
one thing we did is now that uh we have

718
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,740
this labor property in JS contact at a

719
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,559
couple of places and we now decided even

720
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,779
though it's not a standard property we

721
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,059
guide implementations to convert this to

722
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,640
the xav label which effort introduced

723
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,059
around in the year 2000 or so

724
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,940
um in their address books so it's

725
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,279
it's been out in the white now since

726
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,799
more than 20 years

727
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,740
um we expect all implementations that

728
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,820
ever seen a vCard of an apple client uh

729
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,039
can deal with the xab label either by

730
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,100
ignoring it or by actually knowing what

731
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,080
to do with it so it seems like the

732
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,539
better choice rather than introducing a

733
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:18,960
new label property in vCard and

734
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
um run into

735
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,880
conflicts if there is an exab label but

736
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,960
also a new label type

737
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,580
that being said I'm not sure if we

738
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,880
should register the xab label property

739
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,980
at Ayanna I don't know if that's even

740
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,080
possible for an X property but um

741
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:42,000
yeah I guess we can decide this after

742
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,659
this meeting

743
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,520
um one other thing that's also relevant

744
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,480
for GS calendar actually we defined how

745
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,980
to preserve

746
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,320
properties that are unknown to the

747
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,600
implementation during conversion from JS

748
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,100
contact to v card over the other

749
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,179
direction we initially had we in the

750
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,419
previous draft we had a couple of

751
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:08,100
properties how to do that

752
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,440
um some of them

753
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,240
we figured as being convenience

754
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,000
properties for simple type values during

755
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,620
implementation it turned out that

756
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,880
implementing these convenience

757
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,159
properties is way more work and really

758
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,820
it's not convenient at all

759
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,980
in in contrast to just having one

760
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,380
specific way how to

761
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,779
write and read these

762
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,820
special properties

763
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,059
and with these with these properties and

764
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:39,059
the rest with it um we are now able to

765
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,460
fully convert between v card and JS

766
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,100
contact without loss of information that

767
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,799
doesn't necessarily mean that

768
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,980
um everything in a vCard is kind of a

769
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,500
first class feature in JS contact and

770
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,700
the other way around

771
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,860
but

772
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,840
you can still preserve all the

773
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,580
information in transit by converting

774
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,340
back and forth over a couple of systems

775
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,019
that might talk to each other in either

776
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,600
that or that format so

777
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,619
is this seems like a good goal for us to

778
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,659
aim at um I don't think we should aim

779
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,659
for complete feature priority

780
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,399
cool

781
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,118
um next slide please

782
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,520
so that being said we want to start

783
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,679
working group last call

784
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,719
um we

785
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,000
we found a couple of nits that we want

786
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,339
to change in the document so I guess we

787
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,679
might want to update the document before

788
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,260
we go into last call

789
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,060
um one of the things we wanted to

790
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,159
address is now already came up during

791
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,080
today's JS Canada session which is

792
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,699
versioning

793
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,480
um I say we we discuss and come up with

794
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,719
a proposal for that very soon as part of

795
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,060
JS contact working group loss core and

796
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,099
then use the same mechanism also for JS

797
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,200
calendar

798
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,980
um

799
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,960
and so that being said

800
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,480
um we just need to decide when start

801
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,599
when to start last call

802
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:09,000
that's the end of my presentation cool

803
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,160
thanks Robert

804
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,180
um

805
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,560
it

806
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,380
does anyone else want to say anything on

807
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,900
it I think it sounds like just publish

808
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,640
something this week and do a work in

809
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,140
group we'll have to call it straight

810
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,940
away

811
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,720
we've got um the coconut stuff coming up

812
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,980
we've got Tuesdays is J star day

813
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,920
so we could perhaps widen the audience a

814
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,599
bit and maybe something would come up

815
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,740
there

816
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,740
but well if we that could be during

817
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,359
working group last call and then and

818
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,540
then review your comments yeah

819
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,520
yeah

820
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,740
just another opportunity to uh to

821
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,140
discuss this and uh

822
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,980
ensure there's no last minute problems

823
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,579
so how long typically uh do we have last

824
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,380
call is that two weeks or yeah

825
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,619
cool

826
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,920
So Daniel has currently offered to be

827
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,599
the shepherd for these documents thanks

828
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,700
Daniel thanks

829
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,859
so I guess the action from this is

830
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:22,140
Daniel to issue working group last call

831
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,240
did you want to publish one more version

832
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,160
first or do you want to just issue it

833
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,480
with the current one and make the change

834
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,839
I think it's better to that that we

835
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,820
um publish a new version

836
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,599
um the the smart stuff we found is

837
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,579
clarifying definitions and I don't think

838
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,380
we need to go into last call with

839
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,720
something we know which might be not as

840
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,759
clear as we wanted it to be so cool

841
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,720
all right

842
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,480
all right thank you uh next up is tasks

843
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,540
all right Mike

844
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,220
um okay

845
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,720
um yep

846
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,280
um there's not much been changed

847
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,140
unfortunately between these things I did

848
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,260
make a whole bunch of changes uh

849
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,740
according to the discussion we had

850
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,040
either the last one or the one before

851
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,940
um

852
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,079
having got over the fear of components

853
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:25,920
um

854
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,660
so I did introduce this V status

855
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,140
property I rewrote the draft to um to

856
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,780
use that the issue we had around tasks

857
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,920
was that

858
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,339
um really you won't be able to report

859
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,300
um

860
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,720
changes in status and and and maintain

861
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,640
them and it needs to be more than just a

862
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,300
simple status property so that um it now

863
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,940
allows you to have a reason which is

864
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,920
usually intended to be something fairly

865
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,300
structured

866
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,540
um and and you can add comments and

867
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,720
whatever else to it to to provide more

868
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,640
detail

869
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,040
um I got around all sorts of of problems

870
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,619
in the spec we had this weird um

871
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,500
group parameter to try and group things

872
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,680
together but it didn't work very well

873
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,500
um so these status can we move on to the

874
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,820
next one

875
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,940
um

876
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,380
um oh yeah there's there's a couple of

877
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,839
properties we introduced was um this

878
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,359
reason property it was already around as

879
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,220
a parameter but it worked much better as

880
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,980
a property it it takes something like a

881
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,040
a fairly well defined

882
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,780
um

883
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,140
um value which is usually uh indicating

884
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,800
of some something that can be

885
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,280
interpreted automatically by by things

886
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,320
um

887
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,060
oh yeah that was a that was an

888
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,680
afterthought I think you'll forget that

889
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,359
last comment I was wondering whether in

890
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:57,540
fact summary was uh meant the same sort

891
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,460
of thing but but in fact summary is just

892
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,500
free text and the idea is to try and

893
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,560
make reason a little less free text-ish

894
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,339
for for automatic processing

895
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:09,300
um

896
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,640
just skip onto the next one and this is

897
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,140
just a summary of the changes I made

898
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,460
here um oh yeah that's the other thing

899
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,320
so now we have the participant property

900
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,040
just following the um the the backwards

901
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,960
compatibility issues with uh you know

902
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,119
guide in in the event publishing thing

903
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,099
we could just use participant to group

904
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,079
stuff together to add extra information

905
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,900
so that got rid of a whole load of weird

906
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,540
uh parameters we were attaching to to

907
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,940
the attendee they just become regular

908
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,800
properties and and some of those

909
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,740
parameters we added they were just they

910
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,140
were just copies of of

911
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,140
pre-existing

912
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,980
properties like DT stamp can be used to

913
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,780
show when when this took place and we

914
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,579
can just add comments and all sorts of

915
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:54,839
things like that you can input of these

916
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,240
status inside this so you could have a

917
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,380
track of

918
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,200
um how the state has changed for a given

919
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,079
participant in the in the task

920
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,420
so it made things a lot simpler in the

921
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,920
in the end

922
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,260
oh and I didn't spell participant right

923
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,180
did I party pants

924
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,200
sounds better actually

925
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,940
I'm wearing my party pants

926
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,420
next next one please

927
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,060
I like that I'm going to keep that

928
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,720
um

929
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,400
and there was some there's been a

930
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,440
certain amount of discussion

931
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,280
um

932
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,200
on on uh

933
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,060
we had people on a bunch of calls and

934
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,400
Cal connect and and I think there was

935
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,079
some issues around duration and

936
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,940
estimated duration largely in terms of

937
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,520
perhaps it needs to be clarified what

938
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,980
they what they both intended to mean and

939
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,640
that I think I see duration as being a

940
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,740
sort of window within which you can do

941
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,960
something and the estimated duration is

942
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,339
how long you think it will actually take

943
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,500
to do it so you know duration could be

944
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,119
weeks and the estimated duration can be

945
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,220
about three hours

946
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,920
um but it also

947
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,300
um we we spent some time talking about

948
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,880
stuff at a complete odds because I

949
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,460
hadn't noticed and some people had that

950
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,440
5545

951
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,980
um

952
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,359
had introduced a restriction on

953
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,500
um

954
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,260
on durations required you to have a DT

955
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,020
start that wasn't there before it

956
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,640
suddenly got added part way through the

957
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,280
process which I never noticed and and I

958
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,720
think that needs to be removed and I

959
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,599
think I I reintroduced another slide

960
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,460
deck which which talks about that a

961
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,839
second I could whiz through in a minute

962
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,260
if if need be but I think we we just we

963
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,060
presented that and never went any

964
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,740
further with it

965
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,480
um so I'd like to resolve that issue as

966
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,040
well

967
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,339
is that it or is this something else

968
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,980
uh you've got two more slides keep going

969
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,980
then oh yes yes this I think is the is

970
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,000
is

971
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
um is this um as as the um the Jason

972
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,800
stuff is coming along

973
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,320
pretty well we probably need to ensure

974
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,960
that we're reasonably well aligned my

975
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,420
incarnations to tr is not to add too

976
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,820
much to this task specification it deals

977
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,040
with a bunch of specific issues

978
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,380
and I'd like to

979
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,140
um try and wrap this thing up I'm not

980
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,820
sure

981
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,099
um whether in fact you know I did say

982
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:22,500
before that maybe it should contain Json

983
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,680
representations of of uh what we're

984
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,300
doing but

985
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,339
I'm not sure that makes an enormous

986
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,320
amount of sense actually

987
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,980
um

988
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,780
it's something we need to do going

989
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,700
forward but

990
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,680
um at this stage I've been kind of just

991
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,260
push this thing out fairly quickly and

992
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,060
then

993
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,060
um

994
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,619
you know suck it into into the the

995
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:52,440
mapping stuff that we do as uh later on

996
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,060
that it seems to make more sense when

997
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,079
you get this thing out of the way

998
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,700
because it's been pretty well discussed

999
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,260
already

1000
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,599
um and and I think I'd like to see it

1001
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:03,480
out and done

1002
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,220
um but in we still need to make sure

1003
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,900
that we don't have any incompatibilities

1004
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,819
between where we're going with with the

1005
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:13,460
uh the Jason stuff and the next one was

1006
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,960
oh yeah that's right yes as I said this

1007
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,400
is all the same thing there's been a

1008
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,440
whole bunch of of suggested things that

1009
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,180
could be added to tasks but I think

1010
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,579
that's where we should we should tie

1011
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:26,400
that in with what we're doing with um JS

1012
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,040
test either with the current

1013
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,260
spec that's been worked on

1014
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,800
or as a separate set of extensions after

1015
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
that comes out it depends on but I don't

1016
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,359
think we should tie that we should just

1017
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,300
start adding stuff to this this this

1018
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,560
tasks draft

1019
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,940
um that's my feeling anywhere

1020
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,780
cool

1021
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:57,259
hello hello this is

1022
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,460
um hey Mike

1023
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,040
um just uh trying to clarify so this

1024
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,140
final slide you're mentioning

1025
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,440
um this is what we discussed about uh

1026
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,359
addressing we suggest tasks of also

1027
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,040
stuff like issue tracking systems and

1028
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,240
these kind of things

1029
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,980
is that what you had in mind

1030
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,560
yeah I I think so I think this provides

1031
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,420
the other the current draft provides the

1032
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,880
basis to to build some things on there's

1033
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,380
been things like talking about you know

1034
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,520
representing

1035
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,200
um check boxes and things of that kind

1036
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,140
yeah yeah okay I think all that stuff I

1037
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,980
think unless it's fundamental to to this

1038
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,560
extension I'd be inclined to just push

1039
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,079
this out without addressing those

1040
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,900
and and then we we

1041
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,060
um we address it

1042
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,619
um in

1043
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,500
in the context of of you know JS tasks

1044
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,780
as well so it becomes an extension to to

1045
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,940
either an extension to both or something

1046
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,800
that is rolled into the JS tests thing

1047
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,020
which hasn't been around as long and

1048
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,000
maybe you know depending upon people's

1049
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,160
feelings on how the time skills work

1050
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,780
there that might be a better place to

1051
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,280
address it

1052
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,740
so I think my opinion this would be I

1053
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,740
mean the idea how this went into uh how

1054
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,099
we added these ideas to do to the um JS

1055
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,319
task work was basically

1056
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:14,700
um to think about it from a portability

1057
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,800
perspective to see like what things are

1058
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,859
similar to tasks in you know uh in in

1059
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:21,780
groupware systems and so on

1060
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,280
and

1061
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,160
um I think I don't think that

1062
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,319
necessarily the things we add there you

1063
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,359
know would need to get back to I

1064
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:32,280
calendar since you know I calendar is

1065
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,560
mostly used in in those group

1066
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,839
environments even though it might be in

1067
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,960
some cases yeah so just I don't think

1068
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,180
it's necessarily the case that all of

1069
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,800
these extensions

1070
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,839
um need to have a representation in in

1071
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,339
iCarly

1072
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,200
yeah and that's something we can decide

1073
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,000
on later this is again why I think we

1074
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,220
should just uh that we should just get

1075
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,200
this one out and we can know our

1076
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,300
decisions later on yeah yeah I just

1077
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,680
wanted to make the honestly correctly

1078
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,578
thanks yeah thank you

1079
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,220
foreign

1080
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:09,980
any other commentary on this

1081
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:12,660
so what did you want to do as the next

1082
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,000
step here Mike

1083
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,680
um

1084
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,160
I think probably I need to to check back

1085
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,960
through this but I'm inclined to see

1086
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,880
that we should consider last call

1087
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,200
with it on

1088
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,880
all right

1089
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,339
um I guess I should take this one then

1090
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,300
do you think it's in fit state to do a

1091
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,740
last call now or do you want to do one

1092
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,079
more revision first

1093
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:51,180
I'll give a quick read over the uh

1094
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,680
trying to try and read it over the next

1095
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,060
few days and

1096
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,940
um let you know if I found anything

1097
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,020
um

1098
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,160
because I didn't make a number of

1099
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,380
changes for the uh the V status and the

1100
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,180
participant stuff like I think it's okay

1101
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,160
but I'd like to give a last check but in

1102
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,920
the next few days I'll let you know cool

1103
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,579
thank you all right uh next on our

1104
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,859
agenda according to this is

1105
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,420
your other set of slides so let's oh

1106
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,460
there's the uh the the date time stuff

1107
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,260
very quickly just to remind people where

1108
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,720
that was with the uh duration of DT

1109
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,020
start

1110
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,960
yep

1111
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,859
yeah so just to remind people when

1112
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:38,900
somebody pointed out that um

1113
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,700
uh

1114
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,800
yeah it's that last sentence if duration

1115
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,680
appears in to do prop then DT start must

1116
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,040
also appear That's that that was not in

1117
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,220
in 2445 it was not in most of the drafts

1118
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,839
for five five four five it suddenly

1119
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,300
appeared around draft seven and nobody

1120
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,780
knows why not even Bernard

1121
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,500
um

1122
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,839
it's just there and it doesn't make any

1123
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,660
sense in in it's it it's sort of pretty

1124
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,760
much fundamental to a task is that you

1125
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,099
be able to say how long it's going to

1126
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:12,599
take you don't need to say when it's

1127
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,220
going to start until you decide to

1128
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,480
actually do it

1129
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,980
so it it's and in JS calendar we don't

1130
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,740
have that restriction

1131
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,619
um it it it absolutely does not make

1132
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,359
sense in terms of

1133
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,900
um how tasks work so can you just move

1134
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,240
on a bit we'll try and get this to this

1135
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,980
fairly fast

1136
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,660
um

1137
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,640
so yeah so this is that yeah that's what

1138
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,380
I just said so if we turn on the next

1139
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,339
one

1140
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:43,680
yeah I guess that's what I just said

1141
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,280
again yeah and yeah there we go

1142
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,099
um and then why it matters so

1143
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:51,480
um

1144
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,339
so I think the last slide is the

1145
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:54,780
question

1146
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,420
unless that's the end of it there's two

1147
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,819
more oh there we are so there's no

1148
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:01,400
indication why that constraint was added

1149
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,440
and and I've had a look and and it's not

1150
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,960
enforced in Ike Alpha J and I think Ken

1151
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,640
looked and found it wasn't enforced in

1152
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,660
in

1153
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:14,118
um in levical is that right Ken

1154
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:17,700
yes that's correct it is not enforced

1155
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,980
okay so they're still working to the

1156
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,920
2445 um

1157
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,579
approach

1158
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:27,119
so I would suggest what's the next slide

1159
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,660
and I think

1160
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,940
yes so the question was how do we how do

1161
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,640
we do it is it do we consider it to be

1162
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,800
an error Bernard doesn't think it's an

1163
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,359
doesn't think of it as an error because

1164
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,619
he actually put it in there quite

1165
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:43,140
deliberately but he doesn't remember why

1166
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,599
and we never discussed it because nobody

1167
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,339
noticed until

1168
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:49,980
a few months ago

1169
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,240
um

1170
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,119
so I don't know how we we approach this

1171
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,579
do we add it to the tasks draft which is

1172
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:57,900
one reason why I need to make a change

1173
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,140
over the next few days and say we we're

1174
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,480
updating five five five four four five

1175
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,020
two at five five four five to

1176
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,160
um correct this issue

1177
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,119
would that be a better approach I don't

1178
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:16,640
I don't think we can call it an errata

1179
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,260
yeah that that seems very simple to me

1180
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,040
Daniel what do you think

1181
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:27,599
so

1182
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,619
um

1183
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:34,800
I'm usually more in favor of date

1184
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,700
as a Errata are pretty hard to find I

1185
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,760
think yes

1186
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,880
but that's um maybe I'm um

1187
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,520
underestimating some

1188
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,280
some other issues with that

1189
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,680
I don't yeah I don't think so I I'm

1190
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,140
inclined to the update approach I I

1191
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,940
think Okay the reason I've run through

1192
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,020
this again is because I don't think we

1193
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:58,980
ever

1194
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,599
um made either we didn't make a

1195
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,940
statement or I forgot statement

1196
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,420
um so I'm I'm happy to add an update

1197
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,040
specifically to the for this issue in

1198
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,460
them in the test draft and and point out

1199
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,240
as you as you say most people will miss

1200
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,460
it as narata so well I mean as an update

1201
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,240
makes more sense

1202
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,280
cool Ken all right

1203
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,819
I I initially stood up to argue For

1204
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:31,559
Narada and I thought I'd talk to Murray

1205
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:33,540
about it in Philadelphia but now I'm not

1206
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,880
so sure that I had and that listening to

1207
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,040
Mike it probably does make sense given

1208
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,359
the fact that

1209
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,359
two of the bigger implementations don't

1210
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:44,940
enforce that restriction so there's

1211
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,559
probably no

1212
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,280
big rush to try to file on a rata and

1213
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,020
just mention it in the test traffic as

1214
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,940
you said

1215
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,280
yeah I'll add this section that

1216
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,319
um probably closer to the beginning that

1217
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,240
says how this updates that particular

1218
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,260
issue

1219
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,400
um

1220
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,260
and then

1221
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,819
and then move from there so there's a

1222
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:07,260
change I have to make before we do last

1223
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,160
call

1224
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,800
yeah no I think I I had talked to Murray

1225
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,140
about an Errata but now I I think I

1226
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,420
recall that it was in regards to a vCard

1227
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,599
issue not this particular issue yeah

1228
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,520
does it make sense to do both just so

1229
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,460
people are more likely to see this

1230
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,559
we can certainly ask the ads what they

1231
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,119
think you know present them what the

1232
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,040
what the issue is and see if they can

1233
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,240
give us some guidance

1234
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,760
Francesca is online did you understand

1235
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,660
anything Francesca

1236
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,700
work can you hear me

1237
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,559
yep yep

1238
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,940
well yes erratas are for

1239
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,619
um

1240
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:53,420
bugs and errors or clarifications but

1241
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,980
they shouldn't change the meaning of the

1242
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,900
original RC but that's that's the case

1243
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,420
that's fine we didn't rata

1244
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,339
um

1245
00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:04,559
however if there is like people have

1246
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,460
implemented it

1247
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,000
yeah with that if that creates like

1248
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,960
incompatibility and update is better

1249
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,760
yeah I think I think yeah that that's

1250
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,440
why I put that question right it's not

1251
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,780
really it wasn't really an error in the

1252
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,900
spec it was it was it's just that nobody

1253
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,240
knows why it was done and there was no

1254
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,740
discussion

1255
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,599
um and I think undoing it makes sense

1256
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,579
but it just seemed more like an update

1257
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,859
and given at least two of the major

1258
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:37,079
libraries didn't ever Implement that

1259
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:39,300
that change in the first case

1260
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,880
um we're in a pretty good position and

1261
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,220
and undoing it now probably stops people

1262
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,619
doing and

1263
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:49,020
might give a little more visibility but

1264
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,839
yeah erata will be easier because he

1265
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,640
would just require me to press a button

1266
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,099
and approve but I think in this case the

1267
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,319
the correct thing to do is to to to

1268
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,500
write an update okay that's that's good

1269
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,540
I'll do that then

1270
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,059
just to add more to what Mike said when

1271
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:09,180
nobody knows how or why it was was added

1272
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,339
I I did a pretty extensive search of the

1273
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:14,220
the mailing list traffic and of the ITF

1274
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,020
meeting notes and I could find no

1275
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,380
mention of this having been discussed so

1276
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,880
again I did actually yeah

1277
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,200
if Bernard doesn't know then I'm not

1278
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,780
sure you know why it ever got put in

1279
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,680
yeah I called Bernard and he doesn't

1280
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,500
right we have five minutes left in this

1281
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,359
meeting and I think we still have one

1282
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,280
more agenda item

1283
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,880
to go through

1284
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,720
uh

1285
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:48,300
yes I had had people series and

1286
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,040
server-side subscriptions in there as

1287
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,319
well as things to talk about and I think

1288
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,960
possibly another thing got added

1289
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,020
the agenda yeah the other things I mean

1290
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,240
we can just say that we intend trying to

1291
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,859
do something with the pole and series

1292
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:04,859
and things but not made any progress

1293
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:06,900
and the itip thing is probably something

1294
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,020
I'd quickly like to cover

1295
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,660
cool go ahead then

1296
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,059
so this is in in light of all the

1297
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:16,440
discussions we've been having lately

1298
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,640
over

1299
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,300
um uh you know Jazz calendar and and and

1300
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,400
the rest of it and what I came to

1301
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,380
realize was we really could do with a

1302
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,059
better eye tip

1303
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:30,359
um specification it's it's full of it

1304
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:32,220
could be much shorter than it is and it

1305
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,260
and it could clarify situations a lot

1306
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,960
better it deals with each

1307
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,180
um component type each method each thing

1308
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,460
separately it doesn't make it clear that

1309
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,859
you can and should be sending minimized

1310
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:49,800
components in a lot of cases that only

1311
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,440
send as much as you you have to send

1312
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,420
so I

1313
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,119
I thought this would be a good time to

1314
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,460
consider a rewrite of itip which doesn't

1315
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,559
necessarily change

1316
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:04,500
it my you know change the actual um

1317
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,119
workings of itip I don't think there's

1318
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:08,640
anything wrong with with itip as it

1319
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,000
stands just that it it's really hard to

1320
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,059
work your way through that spec and

1321
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:16,020
um

1322
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,980
and understand what's being said and it

1323
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,200
also has some relevance to VPO in the

1324
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,559
VPO updates itip and one of the biggest

1325
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:28,260
sections is is the itip updates because

1326
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,220
itip is such a huge draft a spec rather

1327
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,440
so the

1328
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,839
um I did start looking at what a

1329
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:39,359
Rewritten itip might be like and I

1330
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,040
started copying and pasting a lot of

1331
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,540
stuff

1332
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,619
um

1333
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,720
it would also be an opportunity perhaps

1334
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,700
to add in

1335
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,900
um

1336
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,300
some direct reference to to

1337
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,380
um

1338
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,319
JS calendar representations and and

1339
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:59,420
other things and perhaps you know gmap

1340
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,460
what were the thoughts

1341
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,980
sounds good

1342
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,260
yeah this is Ken so Mike and I discussed

1343
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,000
this previously and I I also think it

1344
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,040
definitely needs a rewrite as Mike said

1345
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,720
it that the top level uh focuses on uh

1346
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,980
components and then runs through each

1347
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,420
method for each one of those and I think

1348
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,140
by and large the methods are pretty

1349
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,880
consistent across all the components so

1350
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,680
I think starting with those and it's

1351
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,020
describing the differences uh makes more

1352
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,260
sense uh additionally I'm not sure how

1353
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,599
many implementations actually support

1354
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,940
counter and decline counter and they

1355
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,260
think that could probably be replaced

1356
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,819
with v pulse which I think is a much

1357
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:40,880
better better option for what those two

1358
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,579
methods we're trying to uh accomplish

1359
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:46,920
yeah I mean it could be regardless

1360
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,740
either deprecated or or say it's simply

1361
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,240
not a good way of doing

1362
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,819
uh doing things

1363
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:56,400
yeah V poll is definitely Superior to

1364
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,079
those two so maybe we defecate them and

1365
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,040
point People to People

1366
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:09,780
all right well then I guess I will um

1367
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,819
put a little more effort into into that

1368
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:12,780
then

1369
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,140
I did make a start all right so I think

1370
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,420
the action here Mark is for you to put

1371
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,460
together a draft and we'll do a call for

1372
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,260
adoption

1373
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,859
okay

1374
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,079
I'll do that

1375
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,859
thank you

1376
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,880
all right um

1377
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,299
and now in theory I think if I unshare

1378
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:41,059
these slides and then screen share

1379
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,720
here's a Milestones so submit

1380
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,940
subscription upgrade document for

1381
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,619
publication obviously needs to be

1382
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:53,940
updated

1383
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,319
to

1384
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:56,700
now

1385
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,099
that's going to happen this week

1386
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:02,460
hopefully uh tasks draft we think is

1387
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,359
just about ready as well

1388
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:09,059
sorry sorry yes there's a message in the

1389
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:11,880
chat about the erratas just wanted to

1390
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,140
note oh yeah

1391
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,540
oh yeah thanks Francesca yes I'll have a

1392
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,880
look at that I I believe that should be

1393
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,140
fine

1394
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,640
um but I'll I'll take a glance through

1395
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:27,240
foreign

1396
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,240
document

1397
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,819
do we think December's realistic at this

1398
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,440
stage

1399
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,299
Mike

1400
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:38,819
um possibly I I think that it updates

1401
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:41,400
itip so my thoughts were if we can get

1402
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,839
it

1403
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:44,460
um straightened out it would make the

1404
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,299
job of of it's the biggest part left to

1405
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:51,119
update in vpoles is doing the itip

1406
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:52,680
updates

1407
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,660
all right so we should probably

1408
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,700
bump this out till next day ATF Because

1409
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,380
by the time you do a draft and then we

1410
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,359
do a call for adoption and then a last

1411
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:01,500
call it's going to take a little while

1412
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,200
we should do this after that so I think

1413
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,299
realistically

1414
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:10,680
say April 23 for that yeah and regarding

1415
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,359
the people this is kind of regarding

1416
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,040
people I keep promising Mike that I'll

1417
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,460
give it a read and read implement it

1418
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,319
um I think I'll have time between the

1419
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:22,380
holidays to do pet projects like this so

1420
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,180
I'll make a conservative effort to

1421
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,280
actually both read it and re-implement

1422
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,000
it

1423
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,980
yeah I think I have a partially working

1424
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,839
VPO as well but I still need to do a bit

1425
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:32,700
of work myself

1426
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,780
cool

1427
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,960
series and

1428
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,280
um server-side subscription

1429
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,540
series I need to get back to I haven't

1430
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,339
had a chance to even look at them so um

1431
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:45,980
what what day do we got on there

1432
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:49,619
December this year oh no it's gonna have

1433
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:52,799
to be mid mid year next year media next

1434
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,460
year cool

1435
01:00:57,859 --> 01:01:01,079
were you using the old ASCII so we might

1436
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:02,520
have to

1437
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,980
to update the format of the the document

1438
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,000
let's all republish

1439
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,759
what do you think

1440
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,640
what do you think Ken

1441
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,660
are we

1442
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:30,480
we're still getting something out of

1443
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,099
apple aren't we

1444
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:34,260
it definitely works

1445
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,040
um

1446
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,760
I'm Martin Guida tested it way back when

1447
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,680
I'm in like cologne I think at a cal

1448
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,839
connect but nobody seems to be banging

1449
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:44,400
down the doors for this so I don't even

1450
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,140
know if it uh

1451
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,240
you know where we stand with it to be

1452
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,700
perfectly honest let's let's read it

1453
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,280
through again and maybe maybe it um next

1454
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,440
week we can talk it over somewhere and

1455
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,299
see whether whether it's attractive

1456
01:01:57,299 --> 01:01:58,559
enough

1457
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,599
for any of us to want to implement it

1458
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:03,720
anyway right it's it's it's really a

1459
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,140
optimization for clients but if if

1460
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,059
clients aren't going to use it then you

1461
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,220
know what's the point

1462
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,500
well Apple have something that they do

1463
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,579
use and and it's not quite this and

1464
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:19,440
um and it was certainly Apple who raised

1465
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,420
it uh in the past I think you're just a

1466
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,040
little more active on the calendaring

1467
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,339
side they've become a little less active

1468
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:29,460
um yeah uh

1469
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,380
I wouldn't be surprised they come come

1470
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,319
back to this at some point in the future

1471
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:37,020
yeah okay I I I I was thinking about

1472
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,700
subscription upgrade Not server-side

1473
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,500
subscription so

1474
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,380
um

1475
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:44,760
let's keep moving with this and see if

1476
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,140
we can align with what's currently out

1477
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,359
there all right I've put it for February

1478
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:50,660
and we can always update it

1479
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,160
but at least it gives us some rough idea

1480
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,260
uh Jazz calendar mapping document we've

1481
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,640
already said that it's going to be more

1482
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,000
like July do we want to do that's got

1483
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,619
just kind of bits in there as well so

1484
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:03,900
that this whole set

1485
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,579
just kind of mapping document

1486
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,380
can I edit the title as well no I can't

1487
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,660
without creating a new one that's okay

1488
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,299
near enough is good enough

1489
01:03:15,299 --> 01:03:16,200
um

1490
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,359
do we have any other Milestones to add

1491
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:21,540
at this stage probably yes we need to

1492
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:26,000
add diet chip thing yeah

1493
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,180
adopt a

1494
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:33,680
drug updating our chip

1495
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,160
and aim for doing that December January

1496
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:42,720
so January see January yeah

1497
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,540
quick question for the chair

1498
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:48,000
regarding adoption that does Mike have

1499
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,720
to have a full-blown

1500
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,660
document or mostly just an outline of

1501
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,000
what the new

1502
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,220
you know uh table of contents is going

1503
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,380
to look like an outline of goals I think

1504
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,780
it's fine yeah I'm gonna do a big copy

1505
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,940
and paste operation and see how close I

1506
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,619
get to looking

1507
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:11,160
um and I'm trying not to modify

1508
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,040
um text that matters obviously so I

1509
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,020
think the copy and paste is going to

1510
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,819
work

1511
01:04:17,819 --> 01:04:20,220
right it's it's pretty much guaranteed

1512
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,200
to pass the call for adoption given that

1513
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,000
we've got most of the people on this

1514
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,740
call who are going to want to say things

1515
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,180
about it

1516
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,140
um

1517
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,839
so just a document will be fine

1518
01:04:30,839 --> 01:04:32,339
yep

1519
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:35,160
cool anything else to add we're already

1520
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,099
four minutes over time so

1521
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:40,619
I think that's all the all the documents

1522
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:44,480
have been checked for time at least

1523
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,240
happy

1524
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,900
