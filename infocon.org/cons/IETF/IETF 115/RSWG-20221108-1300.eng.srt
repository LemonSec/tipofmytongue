1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,400
foreign

2
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,879
right

3
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,080
oh wow

4
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,479
I guess we're done

5
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,180
sounds good to me

6
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,619
tired tired of working hard

7
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,439
calls coming later Paul's coming up

8
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,000
early uh Paul's Community

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,080
well we don't need him to the end right

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,220
we don't need to delete him

11
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,660
you want to get started don't get

12
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,739
started

13
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,420
I thought I might give a QR matches

14
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,459
because it's so thin what's that I might

15
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,180
give it a few more minutes

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,879
we've got

17
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,599
half a dozen extras in the room

18
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,560
in the uh online

19
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,300
probably not seeing much for being here

20
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,000
the beans in the online room so maybe

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,019
he's

22
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,680
joining us

23
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,860
if someone online would indicate that

24
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,780
they can hear us just fine that would be

25
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,099
good

26
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,340
foreign

27
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,179
thank you

28
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,739
we'll get started in a couple of minutes

29
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,360
as people drift in from lunch

30
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
come join the fun side of the room Mike

31
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,099
thank you

32
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,060
guys give cleansing credit for saying

33
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,840
that people would Fade Out

34
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,739
that's true

35
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,019
oh by the way everybody look up at me

36
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,159
for a moment

37
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,560
every look up who wants to take notes

38
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,139
come on someone take notes for us did

39
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,419
you agree

40
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,919
yeah yeah no that's not fair

41
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,660
excellent

42
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,280
yes

thank you sir

45
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,160
here

46
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,020
I know Alexander yeah

47
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,020
well we can start going through intro

48
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,300
slides

49
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,580
all right why don't we at least start

50
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,880
getting through the intro slides and

51
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,160
fun stuff like that

52
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,300
welcome to rswg it is only Tuesday so we

53
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,060
shall note the note well

54
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,340
although everybody in this room better

55
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,080
bloody well know the note well at this

56
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,699
point

57
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,600
um

58
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,060
We are following ietf procedures if

59
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,100
you've got questions about them perhaps

60
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,780
you'd like to step out before you

61
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,380
participate

62
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,620
there are a list of ietf procedure

63
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,560
documents including code of conduct that

64
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,680
you want to make sure you know

65
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,419
all right here is our agenda

66
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,680
um

67
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,160
so we've got a discussion of the SVG

68
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,500
stuff up front what we're going to do

69
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,440
about the SVG profile

70
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,160
then

71
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,380
a discussion of the 79 91 bis as is

72
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,759
draft

73
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,699
and whether that needs to be adopted Etc

74
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:14,100
and so forth and then a 79.91 this what

75
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,800
we want it to be

76
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
draft

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,660
and then after that discussion is done

78
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,580
all other business

79
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,740
any agenda bashing

80
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,360
anything else we need on here

81
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,380
he looks to the room he looks to the

82
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,560
chat

83
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,759
Lars

84
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,460
I could have a very minor point but the

85
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,699
naming convention is starting so 1791

86
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,759
Biz as is versus Biz we need to pick

87
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,319
some better attacks yeah because this is

88
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,660
really

89
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,560
hitting the limits of our naming

90
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,600
conventions hard

91
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,220
yeah that's my fault we'll figure

92
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,419
something out

93
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,419
foreign

94
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,020
seeing nothing else we will call that an

95
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,500
agenda

96
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,600
and that is the end of the general

97
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,979
slides who's up first

98
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,740
Martin

99
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,180
you're on first

100
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,840
third base

101
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,599
um which slides am I doing

102
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,599
uh

103
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,120
why don't they see the SVG slides in

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,800
here did you not

105
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,800
okay

106
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,479
let me do a refresh and see if they pop

107
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,680
in

108
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,599
cost of thousands yeah they have they

109
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,280
were not uploaded yet

110
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,698
no problem

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,259
can you dance a little jig while we're

112
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,840
waiting yeah I'm just wondering why the

113
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,780
only bit of this I know stages

114
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,220
I see issues ah there we go okay

115
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,500
yep yep yep got it it just so happens

116
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,360
the only part of the stage that Creeks

117
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,740
is the part that has the X on it

118
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,099
all right so

119
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,860
um not moisturized not my draft but um

120
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,840
someone has to stand up here and do the

121
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,840
presentation so that's me next please

122
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,060
yeah hold on

123
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,560
there we go

124
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,099
thank you

125
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,279
standing back here right so um Brian

126
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,200
submitted this draft uh it's a

127
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,500
collection of uh I guess you might say

128
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,080
problems gripes and

129
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,659
um aspirations as to what we can do with

130
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,279
svgs

131
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,240
um

132
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,560
this

133
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,459
applies to now he says SVG RFC 1.2 I

134
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,220
don't know what 1.2 is so I'm not sure

135
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,019
what that means but presumably this

136
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,779
means 79 7996

137
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,640
the um

138
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,860
the list has discussed some of these

139
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,600
things

140
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,380
um

141
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,600
and Brian speculates that the reason

142
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,080
that the diagrams uh restrictions are as

143
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
they are was for vision limited people I

144
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,240
would probably contest that myself

145
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,500
I think there are a number of reasons

146
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,320
for the restrictions in 7996

147
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,500
and um that was maybe one of them

148
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,519
uh next slide please

149
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,200
so I think probably the biggest problem

150
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,399
that we have here is this first point

151
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,440
there are some tools that can produce

152
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,860
spgs that comply with the profile that

153
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,360
we've invented

154
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,839
but not very many of them there's a and

155
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,959
a large number of SVG features that a

156
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,600
lot of tools will innately rely on when

157
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,160
they generate content even the most

158
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,920
simple content and uh

159
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,779
it turns out that it's it's very

160
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,880
difficult to programmatically clean up

161
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,920
some of those things as markers and

162
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,660
fonts and all sorts of other things that

163
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,459
have to be stripped out which makes it

164
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:03,240
very

165
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,180
very challenging for SVG check to

166
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,800
produce something that that looks the

167
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,500
same as the input image when the output

168
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,279
has to be so narrowly constrained

169
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,019
um and Brian makes a point about black

170
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,000
and white uh I think we should probably

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,459
have a discussion about uh whether

172
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,279
there's room for grayscale or colors or

173
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,560
a limited palette or other things but

174
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,180
we'll get to that on on subsequent

175
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,500
slides

176
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,220
um

177
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,140
there's

178
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,180
um a whole bunch of things

179
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,339
um that the Brian identifies as being

180
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,260
problematic in tools

181
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,440
I don't think this quite covers all of

182
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,360
the the things there are quite a lot of

183
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,560
features that I would love to use in

184
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,680
fact that aren't available in this very

185
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,480
narrow profile that we have

186
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,140
next

187
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,300
yeah

188
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,700
this surprised me but it turns out that

189
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,940
some tools put Javascript in svgs

190
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,560
because

191
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,120
and likely for good reasons uh not all

192
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,300
uh viewer tools were like we'll process

193
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,880
that JavaScript but there's uh a number

194
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,620
of cases where they put it in just in

195
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,940
case because we've got certain browsers

196
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,260
if we need to work with or something I

197
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,760
don't know

198
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,579
um there's a whole bunch of transform

199
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:23,160
metrics and and things like that I think

200
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,899
the point here about transforming text

201
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,820
into separate letters is what I would

202
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,860
call a bug on the part of the tool that

203
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,920
generates the SVG I took a brief look at

204
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,019
one one example which was I think the

205
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,180
goat tool does that

206
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,120
um that's a to my mind a bug

207
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,760
I have an implementation that does

208
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,740
basically the same thing that puts all

209
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,120
of those characters into the same string

210
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,820
and it works perfectly fine

211
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,959
modulo some font metric issues

212
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,880
um and the other one that's uh that's

213
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,560
come up and we've had a bit of debate

214
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,959
about is the restrictions around width

215
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,339
and height and view box and the

216
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,839
interaction with those in terms of how

217
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,680
they get displayed in HTML in particular

218
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,480
I think there's some constraints also on

219
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,760
on how PDF generation works with this as

220
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,899
well

221
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,100
so

222
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,019
um

223
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,660
Brian also knows that the ASCII art uh

224
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,459
Alternatives although I believe that's

225
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:18,779
largely been

226
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,060
addressed from the perspective of the

227
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,279
format itself there's potentially a need

228
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,079
for some of the tooling around that to

229
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,480
ensure that something sensible gets

230
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,740
produced on the ASCII side of things

231
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,899
when we have a diagram produced as SVG

232
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:36,860
uh last slug please

233
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,140
so a suggestion here is to take a look

234
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,480
at 7996 and uh change it

235
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,940
uh

236
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,680
concentrating on the things that are

237
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,779
forbidden is probably a sensible

238
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,519
approach in my opinion as well

239
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,639
the restricted grammar has turned out

240
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,180
being to be rather restrictive

241
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,959
um and it's probably not the case that

242
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,260
the that the tooling we have is

243
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,060
incapable of dealing with a lot of these

244
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,620
things it's just that we've profiled

245
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,600
them away

246
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,000
and um that part of the reason I believe

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,680
that we were profiling them away so it

248
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,120
would be easier to implement the SVG

249
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,060
thing but as as a practical matter SPG

250
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,839
is complex and large and the set of

251
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,180
things that are widely implemented

252
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,700
changes over time and is probably a

253
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,139
great deal larger than what's in this

254
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,920
tiny profile that we have

255
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,019
the accessibility side of things becomes

256
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,399
particularly interesting and we've had a

257
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,560
number of discussions on the mailing

258
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,839
list about this particular aspect of it

259
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,480
there are probably some accessibility

260
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,240
guidelines we can lean on for for this

261
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,980
and then we also have the question of

262
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,760
how much of that belongs in um style

263
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,220
guide as opposed to sort of policy

264
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,519
format related documents and we'll

265
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,680
probably have to work through that

266
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,680
in practice as well as in terms of

267
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,040
understanding what the the format

268
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,339
documents say in the end

269
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,480
we have a queue

270
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,519
this is the end I wanted to get to the

271
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,839
end because I didn't have much to say

272
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,519
Robert

273
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,100
so the word in the upper left corner

274
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,980
where you said replace verbally you said

275
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,519
um change I think that we try to pretend

276
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,579
that 7996 never existed

277
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,220
go down the path that you're

278
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,860
suggesting here

279
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,700
um

280
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,040
build a

281
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,399
set of recommendations about what can

282
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,540
appear in rfcs yeah speak in terms of

283
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,800
policy not in in terms of implementation

284
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,040
but keep in mind that

285
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,000
we will have to build tools for the

286
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,079
authors

287
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,019
and tools for the RPC

288
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,260
and in particular

289
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:10,139
watch out for making it hard to

290
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,320
um

291
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,699
build something for the RPC that would

292
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,399
let them make something that meets the

293
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,740
spirit of the recommendations out of

294
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,519
somebody that handed them complete

295
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,820
smash yeah right

296
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,040
yeah so we've seen a number of cases

297
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,160
where the complete Mash has been been

298
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,620
dropped on people and I I think that

299
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,620
whatever we can do to to first of all

300
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,680
have a style guide that says these these

301
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,600
things and not sensible please don't

302
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,639
submit these and then at the tail end

303
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,100
turn it into something that's practical

304
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,740
for for the tooling and the people

305
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,660
because ultimately we've got to put this

306
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,699
through that process to

307
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,100
the net bullet that you had about you

308
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,300
know turns out that you can have

309
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,800
JavaScript

310
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,660
um there's actually a couple of

311
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,959
languages that you can embed inside SVG

312
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,480
yes a JavaScript is the worst defender

313
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,339
in that it is pretty much the full

314
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,560
engine it can like jump on the network

315
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,540
and do stuff

316
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,560
yeah

317
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,620
I I think that probably having having no

318
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,500
scripting is a pretty simple thing to do

319
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,220
and a pretty simple thing to remove

320
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,600
but when it comes to some of these other

321
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,519
features we have to think about the

322
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,260
entire production pipeline that we have

323
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,120
and everything that it touches along the

324
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,680
way one of the things we've seen

325
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,800
particularly with XML to RSC recently is

326
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,060
that Wheezy print which is what we're

327
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,060
currently using to produce PDFs has a

328
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,500
number of restrictions in it that mean

329
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,620
that it's very difficult to take things

330
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,779
that would ostensibly meet all of the

331
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,060
policy guidelines but wouldn't in

332
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,500
practice turn into something that that

333
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,680
was legible on on a PDF output and so

334
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,959
Robert one question something you said

335
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,839
at the very beginning which were you

336
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,139
seeing ignore that 7996 said anything

337
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,480
about this and start over

338
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,880
um were you seeing that we should have a

339
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,579
separate document on SVG were you saying

340
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,439
both or no no I'm saying obsolete 7996

341
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,980
declared a bad idea walk away okay yeah

342
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,020
I don't think there's anything in 7996

343
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,000
that we can salvage at this point I

344
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,439
agree with

345
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,860
sorry

346
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,660
uh Lars you're up next uh so I

347
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,820
I can't recall for the weather 7996

348
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,460
motivates any of this but sort of

349
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,100
these restrictions on SVG they conflate

350
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,179
a bunch of different things together

351
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,799
right one is that we might want to have

352
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,500
a archival subset one is we might want

353
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,900
to have an accessible subset one is we

354
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,299
might want to impose some complexity

355
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,820
limits on the document but the the

356
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,780
figure right and there's depending on

357
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,179
what we want to do right different

358
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,160
things

359
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,260
lend themselves to to baby being a bit

360
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,480
easier than like again going down the

361
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,400
XML path and like restricting the

362
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,620
language in certain various ways so for

363
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,059
example we could for if we were worried

364
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,460
about complexity of figures we could

365
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,080
entirely leave it up to the review

366
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,780
process to like flag those

367
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,000
archivability accessibility are

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
different right but I think it would be

369
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,340
worthwhile maybe stepping back and

370
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,380
figuring out what's the goal or what are

371
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,240
the goals and then what are the

372
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
mechanisms we have available before

373
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,039
jumping in the deep end of you know this

374
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,200
sort of discussion

375
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,440
that seems perfectly Fair Phil Han Baker

376
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,380
so two points here number one you asked

377
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,940
for uh being able to do text and SVG uh

378
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,700
the tool I'm using is gotify

379
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,140
I had to modify it so it produced code

380
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,820
that fits the tiny SVG thing but if you

381
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,860
look at all the uh specs for the math

382
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,799
mesh all the diagrams in the HTML

383
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,860
version are being generated from text

384
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,620
that's then converted to SVG

385
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,080
however if you look at the text versions

386
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,299
of the documents I don't have the text

387
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,820
versions because I think you're a fool

388
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,500
if you're reading the the drafts in

389
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,980
plain text sorry

390
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,860
um I I think that we should just kill

391
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,160
plain text rfcs they're stupid sorry

392
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,559
that's just a personal opinion

393
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,480
but probably won't mind you sir so on

394
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,299
the other issue of scripting

395
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,980
that is something that I would like to

396
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,960
see a separate draft

397
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,620
describing a safe version of SVG

398
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,520
and preferably I would like to see w3c

399
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,260
producing that

400
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,679
because I want something that is a safe

401
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,320
version of SVG

402
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,140
that isn't going to have a hole drilled

403
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,039
in it by a future version of SVG

404
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,380
and that's not something that we can say

405
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,240
here at the ITF by saying take SVG and

406
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,520
remove this feature

407
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,000
because ITF could introduce a new unsafe

408
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,740
feature so and sometimes having another

409
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,860
set of requirements helps rather than

410
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,020
hinders

411
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,120
I've come to the conclusion that I want

412
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,799
SVG

413
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,240
for my social media interactions

414
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,080
so I want to be able to have social

415
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,679
media interactions on texts that include

416
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,799
mathematical equations and that type of

417
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,840
thing and the only way that I can render

418
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,179
them without knowing

419
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,860
you know there are infinite number of

420
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,620
mathematical notations so I'm going to

421
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,620
be using SVG for presentation

422
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,039
which means that I want a script safe

423
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,880
meaning no scripting version of SVG for

424
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,700
that purpose so that I can move SVG

425
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,380
around

426
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,780
and that's only practical if it's coming

427
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,080
from a draft that says this is a safe

428
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,620
version of SVG so I think in the short

429
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,960
term if we produce a draft

430
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,780
that says SVG minus the script element

431
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,220
that's good

432
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,860
but we really need to get w3c involved

433
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,320
and get them to take ownership of that

434
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,200
because we can't maintain the safety of

435
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,980
that element

436
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,400
all right Echo from the floor yeah

437
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,980
um no hats obviously hence the floor

438
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,679
um so I I like to Echo largest call for

439
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,600
maybe taking a step back and asking what

440
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,679
the things we're trying to accomplish

441
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,320
are here so I've heard at least at least

442
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,480
three to four

443
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,919
um uh requirements

444
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,159
um one uh I'm attempting to like

445
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,200
minimize complexity of the uh of the

446
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,940
diagrams themselves

447
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,740
um two

448
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,080
um our the ability to Archive for the

449
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,880
archival format which I'll return to in

450
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,100
a minute three safety in terms of

451
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,480
embeddability

452
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,559
um to avoid your creating exercise

453
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,480
problems when you like load uh you know

454
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,640
someone else's diagrams into your into

455
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,840
your web page

456
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,480
um and uh uh and for

457
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,059
um uh accessibility for the data right

458
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,539
um so um I do think the fir some of them

459
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,740
are straightforward the archival

460
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,059
archival I'm actually quite concerned

461
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:21,960
about

462
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,760
um for the following reason that like

463
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,340
you know and then this is going to go

464
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,480
back to like a much like a deeper

465
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,860
conversation about cavity but the bottom

466
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,780
line is that like

467
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,520
the

468
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,380
Concepts such as it is behind the XML

469
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,480
data structures is that like one could

470
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,520
at least theoretically read them and

471
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,320
like mentally process what the XML data

472
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,480
model was and I'm sure the context was

473
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,580
um and like without the software's job

474
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,900
is to render that into like into like a

475
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,159
raster format

476
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,900
um that is like perhaps more

477
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,159
aspirational and true but it is like

478
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,020
somewhat true that is entirely false

479
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,640
Refugee right there's no way to look at

480
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,200
the SVG and like if any idea was going

481
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,059
to render at um like in any sensible way

482
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,159
right you can't hand evaluate it and so

483
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,620
I think if our of our view I think if

484
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,820
we're gonna have if we're gonna we're at

485
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,080
a high probability

486
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,100
um that actually requires stepping back

487
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,179
and asking what the real question for

488
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,620
probability and future future

489
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,659
accessibility is for these mini formats

490
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,580
and if it in fact is the case that we

491
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,320
expect someone to be able to read the

492
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,780
canonical format without the AF software

493
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,940
um and if that is true then essay does

494
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,039
not acceptable like format at all um and

495
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,860
if it is not true then like then like

496
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,000
actually many of these issues becomes

497
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,500
like relevant because like you know you

498
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,760
can download operation complicated SVG

499
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,320
processor so I think trying to like I

500
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,120
think so again like I'd call like flight

501
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,740
requirements more and in particular this

502
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,820
requirement I think needs to be really

503
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,020
fleshed out in light of our overall

504
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,640
attitude towards our private ability

505
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,620
yeah I I think that this is where we

506
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,360
probably need to lean much more heavily

507
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,799
on the notion that the text is the

508
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,539
normative component and the and the

509
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,640
diagrams are there as supplemental

510
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
material

511
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,580
um and and that's probably something we

512
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,559
should address in that in in any

513
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,700
requirements discussion yeah

514
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,620
that is not in fact always true uh and

515
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,980
this is something I continue to hop on

516
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,460
with drafts that put all sorts of

517
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,679
semi-normative stuff in diagrams in in

518
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,860
sort of obscure and non-obvious ways but

519
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,240
it's it's something we should probably

520
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,860
think about a little bit more more

521
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,400
carefully Jane yeah Gene Mahoney uh

522
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,440
looking at the bullet point two provides

523
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,080
style guide recommendations on drawings

524
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,460
uh size is easy uh font is easy

525
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,400
complexity uh I don't know what we're

526
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,039
going to be talking about there and

527
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,720
um is that a you know what when you see

528
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,500
it

529
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,140
or is there a way to quantify that

530
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,280
I think that the complexity one is is

531
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,780
really

532
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,580
um going to come down a lot to to

533
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,440
judgment and

534
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,400
um

535
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,380
you can you can take examples that I've

536
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,880
seen in recent internet draft

537
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,039
submissions where there are sequence

538
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,900
diagrams that

539
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,500
um

540
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,140
if rendered in the sort of 80 column

541
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,559
format would have to be rendered with

542
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,120
characters that are not much bigger than

543
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,679
a pixel each because there's just that

544
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,220
many words in the sequence diagram that

545
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,260
sort of thing is probably unacceptable

546
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,419
I I think that the having some sort of

547
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,480
guidelines as in terms of what is the

548
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,400
legibility of of the content when

549
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,640
rendered in a particular size is is one

550
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,659
of the ways you can approach the

551
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,640
complexity problem the other is is

552
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,940
simply how many SVG components in there

553
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,440
if it's several megabytes then it's

554
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,559
probably trying to like there's there's

555
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,480
a few things you can look at but no one

556
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,880
of these things is going to tell you

557
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,320
definitively that this is bad

558
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,720
because I you know Liz has a draft

559
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,580
that's got some some math in it and some

560
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,740
of those look a little fiddly but every

561
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,419
single one of those is perfectly fine

562
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,120
it's exactly the sort of thing that we

563
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,880
should be doing with SVG in in documents

564
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,059
so yes this will be judgment and I think

565
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,860
it will come down to

566
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,179
um

567
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,520
learning over time what what

568
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,460
people find is acceptable or not maybe

569
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,740
some discussions with various streams in

570
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,620
terms of what they're willing to accept

571
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,020
thank you yeah

572
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,360
that's John

573
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,760
it's nice you can stay set until time to

574
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,500
get up it's really yeah it's well

575
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,120
civilized

576
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,740
I have to remember what I say so I can

577
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,080
take notes on myself

578
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,460
um but sort of channeling what Ecker

579
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,980
said if you want to make these diagrams

580
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,679
accessible it's like Esky art is worse

581
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,440
than useless and based on my experience

582
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,440
doing recording for the blind you need a

583
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,320
a narrative text description of what of

584
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,480
what the diagram looks like which pops

585
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,919
us up a level because now we have to add

586
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,900
a new kind of element to Art set which

587
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,520
pops us up a level because art set is

588
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,460
something that we added to the 3.1

589
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,659
vocabulary

590
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,419
so you know while I think it is it is

591
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:49,919
worth thinking about how we're going to

592
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,740
specify the the SVG I totally agree that

593
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,120
we need to back up and figure out what

594
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,799
the problem is and make sure we solve

595
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,720
the actual problem rather than just some

596
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,220
some easy to address aspect

597
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,559
yeah it might be the accessibility

598
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,299
requirements are just too much for us

599
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,720
and

600
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,179
um yeah

601
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:12,900
um

602
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,000
I think it would be unwise for us to try

603
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,799
to invent accessibility requirements but

604
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,179
I think there's a rich literature that

605
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,400
we can draw on because people yeah of

606
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,600
course basically yeah people have been

607
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,820
have been making versions of books for

608
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,380
blind people for a century I mean this

609
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,200
is this is not an this is sort of it's

610
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,419
obscure but it's not poorly understood

611
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,100
and it and and people have a lot of

612
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,860
experience sure

613
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,020
and Elliot hold for one second until

614
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,020
John gets sat back down for note-taking

615
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,620
purposes

616
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,860
ready to go

617
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,100
okay go ahead all right uh hey Martin

618
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,799
um I just wanted to point out that the

619
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,620
normative description is not a it's not

620
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,360
a matter I think you're you're saying

621
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,860
the same thing here but it's definitely

622
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,480
not a matter of whether it's SVG or

623
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,640
ASCII you need the normative description

624
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,799
in either way I can definitely show you

625
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,960
some ASCII diagrams that are

626
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,240
particularly horrible

627
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,940
um and in fact the SVG looks better

628
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,740
in some cases because you can make

629
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,140
things a little bit more readable

630
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,840
um in in the SVG format sometimes even

631
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,580
especially with sequence flow diagrams

632
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,900
that have options

633
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,419
so uh I'm not sure what to do about that

634
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:27,860
but I'll just point out

635
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,100
Phil just to amplify John's point

636
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,520
I think that diagrams should always be

637
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,900
there to assist comprehension

638
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,159
there should never be a requirement

639
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,500
and you know if you've not got the

640
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,480
descript if you have to understand the

641
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,600
diagram to understand the spec then

642
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,100
you're doing it wrong and we've got

643
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,840
other problems

644
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,059
with the spec and so I think a lot of

645
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,460
our accessibility problems that we're

646
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,340
putting into the document format if we

647
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,039
take that principle on board

648
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,140
they just disappear because you know if

649
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,880
you are colorblind and you can't

650
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,400
understand the colors in the diagram

651
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,400
well the text should be giving you that

652
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,380
information

653
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,299
you should never be in a position where

654
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,880
you have to understand a diagram to

655
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,720
understand the spec

656
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,159
you know as as noted that's that's

657
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,020
something we may aspire to but not

658
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,220
always achieve

659
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,880
nice nice this is a similar to what we

660
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,740
do for a pseudocode right where we say

661
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,059
the same thing right the pseudocode

662
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,620
instead illustrate an algorithm but

663
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,700
there still needs to be a textual

664
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,140
description

665
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,720
um of that algorithm and so so it's the

666
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,299
same kind of thing

667
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,059
foreign

668
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,039
thank you all I think we have Direction

669
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,779
though yeah I think this is a good

670
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:55,440
direction

671
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,919
okay

672
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,220
I think we yeah the the authors the the

673
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,260
proposed authors will Author

674
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,480
right

675
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,140
who's next

676
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,419
um Elliot or Martin

677
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:18,440
who wants to go first

678
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,919
well whoever it is the next topic and is

679
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,220
uh what are we to do with the various

680
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,799
7991 as his documents

681
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,440
um I think there's General consensus

682
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,700
um and feel free to disagree with me

683
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,520
that we have to have such a document and

684
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,960
ought to document the tools as they

685
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,640
currently exist and then not be

686
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,679
continuously updated and I think the

687
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,320
question from earlier

688
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,220
at that point too but I think the part

689
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,419
of the question was do we need to like

690
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:46,980
run it through some complicated RFC

691
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,840
process or do we really say like this is

692
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,399
what it is and like it's done and here

693
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,000
it is and et cetera so uh Ellie

694
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,399
uh Elliot no slides at least he's gonna

695
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,879
wing it

696
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,039
um

697
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,679
so I think when Eric asked me to do this

698
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,779
that maybe there was hope for a sort of

699
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,899
Point Counterpoint but

700
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:11,520
um it could well be that we're not going

701
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,899
to get there

702
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:13,559
um

703
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,240
I think there are a couple of parameters

704
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,760
we need to look at

705
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,399
in terms of how we answer this question

706
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:21,600
the first is

707
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,580
how often are we going to update this

708
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,419
thing

709
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,039
so

710
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,220
if we have running code now

711
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,279
and we expect that we're not going to

712
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,539
update

713
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,360
a doc the what we have as a description

714
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,340
for several years

715
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,299
as we work through the rswg process

716
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,340
then my view is we should probably

717
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,700
document what we have now as an RFC

718
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,740
if on the other hand we're going to

719
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,500
allow for continuous update

720
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,740
that then an RFC is not efficient for

721
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,520
that

722
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,279
right it takes too much effort to

723
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,279
continuously publish and the RFC editor

724
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,899
the RPC in the background is probably

725
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,000
going thinking to themselves yeah don't

726
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,980
don't don't don't make us have to

727
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,380
constantly redo the same document

728
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,720
with small changes

729
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,440
um so I think the velocity of change and

730
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,120
how often we want to mark that change

731
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,539
are really the parameters for me

732
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,960
um so I guess it's a matter for where do

733
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,179
we what's what scale of changes do we

734
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,980
think are in front of us before we Mark

735
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,720
those changes and I don't have answers

736
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,399
to that question but that's the those

737
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,440
would be the parameters that I would use

738
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,080
to answer the question okay

739
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,760
it's as simple as that

740
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,240
for me

741
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,360
Martin Thompson

742
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,580
awesome slides as I recall yeah

743
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,200
someone asked me put a slides together

744
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,659
so this is what you get

745
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,840
um these are better fast than usual

746
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,260
impact yeah

747
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,820
yeah let's go let's go to the next one

748
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,940
this is all of the slide all the actual

749
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,700
content of the slide

750
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,080
um

751
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,899
so I think probably the

752
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:14,279
Elliot may have conceded the point

753
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,440
already this is changing and will

754
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,820
continue to change

755
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,299
so um it seems like it's uh

756
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,580
kind of bring up all these other things

757
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,620
but I don't think it's really in our

758
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,539
interest to publish a document that

759
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,220
doesn't really represent the consensus

760
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,620
of the the group that this is the right

761
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,640
format to be to be using

762
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,559
there will be a period of time during

763
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,019
which we will not have a document that

764
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,620
definitively defines the format of rscs

765
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,500
and that period of time

766
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,960
is always going to be finite because it

767
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,440
will exist in the past we can't fix that

768
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,960
I can't change that

769
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,559
um

770
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,960
I will point out that the document is

771
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,659
already in the record I believe that

772
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:04,019
anyone who does care about understanding

773
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:05,940
the format can go and read John's draft

774
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,379
and it's close uh but not 100 accurate

775
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,480
in terms of the the details I don't

776
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,760
think I would prefer not to spend the

777
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,639
effort here validating that it does in

778
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,219
fact match what is implemented

779
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,540
um

780
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,460
it's pretty close but I keep finding

781
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,980
problems with it so and I'm not sure

782
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,119
you've got the section thing right the

783
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,300
section references thing was challenging

784
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,339
for me to understand in the code and I

785
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,199
wasn't able to match that with what was

786
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,060
documented in the in the in the draft

787
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,918
uh so other people pointed out that

788
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,179
perhaps it creates a bad precedent

789
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,800
regarding the content of the editorial

790
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,139
stream I don't particularly mind that it

791
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,639
might create friction against doing a

792
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,520
better job later I don't know I suspect

793
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,260
that the right answer here is is to

794
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,219
think about this as um as uh an input to

795
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,839
a process that we're about to undertake

796
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,460
to

797
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,560
look at um

798
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,839
the way that that the format is going to

799
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,060
be defined more formally

800
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,560
that process May inform a number of

801
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,599
other things as well so next slide

802
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,500
please

803
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,660
this is the um the answer to the

804
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,940
question and then the next slide has

805
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,460
another answer and the next slide has

806
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,280
another answer as well and I'm done

807
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,859
yes

808
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:32,540
see I should let Martin guitar first

809
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,400
[Music]

810
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,400
one

811
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,200
so yeah so I I think actually what

812
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,700
you're highlighting Martin is what we

813
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,140
should do probably is sort of assess the

814
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,300
amount of work that we think is in front

815
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,700
of us into a couple different buckets

816
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,579
that which is and you know that that

817
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,740
which is today

818
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,400
um

819
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,460
that which we want right and that which

820
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,440
is in the document but isn't

821
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,420
right and

822
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,020
um

823
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,720
if we if we break it out that way we can

824
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,599
sort of get at least put a a finger in

825
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,099
the air and say

826
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,980
holy crap this is a lot of work or no

827
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,200
this isn't that much work and if we see

828
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,700
that there's a lot of work to get to

829
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,800
where we want to go then I would say

830
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,140
probably you want to publish that which

831
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,339
is

832
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:28,859
so I think it's almost premature to

833
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,900
answer the question I think the first

834
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,119
exercise is to figure out

835
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,920
where do we want to go and how much work

836
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,079
is it to get there and where are we if

837
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,240
we answer those two questions then this

838
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,619
question becomes I think a little bit

839
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:43,280
easier to answer

840
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,420
okay so Martin do you want yourself in

841
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,359
the queue as just regular commenter

842
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,160
all right then Robert you're up

843
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,079
there is a

844
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,240
large

845
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,619
amount of pent-up demand for change

846
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:10,859
that I've been waving off for

847
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,500
five years at this point because of the

848
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,200
sentiment that we should not be changing

849
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,619
things that the deviations from the 799

850
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,020
family were

851
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,540
um problematic

852
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,619
um but

853
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:32,220
I think that we're going to find if we

854
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,020
start down the path that Elliot was

855
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,060
suggesting of looking at the inventory

856
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,220
that I I think would keep even before we

857
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,740
stepped out of this room it's my opinion

858
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,980
that we will say wow that's big and it's

859
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,359
a lot

860
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,980
so

861
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,619
um I will just throw up as a a strong

862
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,740
hand for that's big and that's a lot the

863
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,960
cry that you've been hearing from me

864
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,780
more and more frequently recently and

865
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,359
that's I want to change the way that we

866
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:03,240
represent names to get away from this

867
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,720
notion of last name and first name

868
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,640
so and that's a big change

869
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,520
Paul

870
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,160
foreign

871
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,980
Paul Hoffman so I have an issue with the

872
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,740
word publish as I think and I want to

873
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,900
check you mean publish as an RFC right

874
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,859
okay

875
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:32,240
I think we need to publish individual

876
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,400
checkpoints at a stable long-lived URL

877
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,700
which the RFC editor has for whatever we

878
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,859
do however we do this

879
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:44,520
I think that's just fine I think we can

880
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,500
publish rfcs we don't have to

881
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,680
I already gave a presentation and

882
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,180
somewhere else

883
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,560
um

884
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,180
I

885
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,660
I think on this publish or not publish I

886
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,040
think that it's somewhat of a red

887
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,700
herring because this is all ignoring the

888
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,220
fact that if we do something in this

889
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,619
working group and say okay that's a

890
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:17,700
checkpoint

891
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,380
you know either we we keep it as a

892
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,380
long-lived draft or we instantiate it

893
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,000
some way ask the RFC Editor to do it

894
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,859
that's a very different process than

895
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:28,859
going out to the ietf community

896
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:33,000
and saying okay ietf last call time wait

897
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,550
wait

898
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,480
[Music]

899
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,160
and stuff like that

900
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,320
we need to decide how much we want the

901
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,920
ietf community's input on the format at

902
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,560
which point at which point to me that's

903
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,540
going to be the biggest impediment to

904
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,460
how we publish

905
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,240
okay

906
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,800
yeah so Paul raises an excellent point

907
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,140
um the reason that we might publish in

908
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,000
terms of an Roc for something like this

909
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,339
is because we think this is well we

910
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:06,720
might we might do it for any number of

911
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,339
reasons

912
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,839
um but

913
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,280
my

914
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,500
my impression is that what we would want

915
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,960
to do as a result of that is this is

916
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,820
memorializing the consensus of this

917
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,460
group that this is a good thing and we

918
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,960
would like to solicit input from all

919
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,760
these other groups we can also ask for

920
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,079
input from all these other groups if we

921
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,420
think that's important here at different

922
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,220
places but I don't think that this is

923
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,859
what we're intending to do with this

924
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:33,480
particular document because this is just

925
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,380
like

926
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,420
documenting what's in the code right now

927
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,760
to the to the greatest extent possible

928
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,980
so um

929
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,500
I think from that perspective where it

930
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,859
stands is probably fine the um

931
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:48,180
the points that Robert raises about

932
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,359
change and how we deal with that

933
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,560
um leads me to

934
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,839
all sorts of other conclusions that

935
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:56,880
would be controversial in this room also

936
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,400
so I'll refrain from

937
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,859
I'll refrain from bringing them up at

938
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,320
this point but I think we really do need

939
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,960
to consider this as a starting point for

940
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,359
um for addressing some of those those

941
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,780
latent change demands because I too want

942
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,119
full names and I I too want to deal with

943
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,940
things like the U element that are

944
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,280
terrible and have changed recently

945
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,560
foreign

946
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,579
so

947
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,200
um we haven't been announcing ourselves

948
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,380
at them at the mic I will start doing so

949
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,180
in case we have people remote I don't

950
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,280
know although it is appearing on the

951
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,079
screen uh I'm trying to make sure that

952
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,000
my speaking is still up there might be

953
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,500
good enough

954
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,680
um

955
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,060
in the analysis

956
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,520
that you were just

957
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,180
skimming Martin do you have an

958
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,160
assumption

959
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,300
that we will republish the rscs that

960
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,579
have been published in the there is

961
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:01,380
nothing that documents what the grammar

962
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,020
those things have been published in

963
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,740
in some future yes this is really the

964
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,640
approved grammar

965
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,079
oh

966
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,619
because if we don't republish

967
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,560
then we've got a several

968
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,240
like

969
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,300
many hundreds over a thousand things

970
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,000
where there is no documentation other

971
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,160
than the code

972
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,960
about what is in those things

973
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,579
Robert can I ask you a question about

974
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:37,079
that actually

975
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,240
um so

976
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,839
do those thousand rfcs

977
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,700
can they be captured all by one document

978
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,079
or do they reflect different generations

979
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,700
of such a document right

980
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,680
right yeah it's it right now it's one

981
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:57,599
yeah and it's the one that the one you

982
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,800
wrote John

983
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,500
okay

984
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,180
so to repeat for John it

985
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,420
yeah so to to the extent possible John

986
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,220
has managed to capture what what it is

987
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,480
implemented in the in the current

988
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,880
implementation I think that's probably

989
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,260
um probably correct there's a bunch of

990
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,220
things that have been added to the

991
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,260
format since seven nine on one there are

992
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,640
a bunch of things that have subtly

993
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,040
changed all of those should largely be

994
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,460
in there I again

995
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,579
it's pretty close and uh until Robert

996
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:32,819
you said this I had not captured in my

997
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,760
head that what you want out of the

998
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,200
publication of a document is

999
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,440
documentation of what is in the archive

1000
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,760
as format

1001
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,500
so I was I was going to address that

1002
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,380
point directly I think that any effort

1003
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,300
that we undertake here

1004
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,280
is

1005
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,200
probably going to need to be backwardly

1006
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,819
compatible in the sense that whatever it

1007
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:02,760
is that we describe tomorrow

1008
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,540
including the full name change and

1009
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,440
all of the other things that we're

1010
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,780
talking about it probably needs to

1011
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,119
document those thousand

1012
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,119
or what what have you going back into

1013
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,520
the past at the point that we do that

1014
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,560
all the deprecated elements that we have

1015
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,200
in 7991 well 7991 deprecate some

1016
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,819
elements we'll probably deprecate some

1017
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:25,619
more in that process we should document

1018
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,000
them in whatever

1019
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,160
um we ultimately produce

1020
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,440
how we produce that I think is is a very

1021
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,060
very interesting question and when we

1022
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,819
produce that is is another one I think

1023
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:37,800
some people are looking for us to do

1024
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,599
something right now

1025
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,060
um sort of a best effort attempt to

1026
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,619
ensure that something goes in the RFC

1027
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,599
series that describes those thousand

1028
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,200
plus uh rfcs that have been published in

1029
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,599
XML format since 7991 that don't

1030
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,780
actually use 7991

1031
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,480
um but I I think that given that we've

1032
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,000
you know 1500 or so documents in we can

1033
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,980
probably wait just a little longer and

1034
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,760
do a good job rather than document

1035
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,960
whatever

1036
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,119
okay Elliott you were in the queue

1037
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,040
it's Elliott

1038
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,140
so um

1039
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,640
I'm trying to

1040
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,700
uh sort a Way Forward here in terms of

1041
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,260
how we can proceed and I think Robert

1042
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,780
you gave a good example of something

1043
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,819
that we could probably work on just as a

1044
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:29,760
way forward to sort of act as a forcing

1045
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,260
function and if you want to work on

1046
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,819
names as the as the first thing or

1047
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:34,079
whatever you want to work on is the

1048
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,720
first thing right then what's the next

1049
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,940
step do you write a short draft to say

1050
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,920
here's what I want to do about names

1051
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,839
do we write a long draft that says here

1052
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,040
we want here's what we want to do about

1053
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,359
everything and one of those things is

1054
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,500
names

1055
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,819
and

1056
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:48,839
um

1057
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:51,660
I think if we if there's the boil the

1058
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,119
ocean approach which I think uh is is

1059
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,880
the latter but I I sort of like the idea

1060
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,619
of sort of knocking these things down

1061
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:00,900
one by one so we don't so we can get

1062
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,040
things fielded faster a little bit more

1063
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,319
uh you know agility if you'll pardon

1064
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:09,119
these the term

1065
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,280
question is then

1066
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,319
how does the whole schema look in the

1067
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:14,280
process

1068
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,900
so maybe what we need to do is break

1069
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,460
these things into two different problems

1070
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,800
right there's the schema and the

1071
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,319
versions of the schema which may or may

1072
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,240
not be an RFC I I'm beginning to think

1073
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,380
it's not

1074
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,780
and then there are the changes to that

1075
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,160
schema

1076
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,579
which are documented in rfcs and that

1077
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:35,520
allow for small incremental we allow

1078
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,020
that allows for incremental work to take

1079
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,980
place

1080
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,619
and I'm just trying to think about how

1081
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:42,300
we move forward and I'm curious as to

1082
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,400
what other people think because you know

1083
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,680
I I'm uh from my perspective I'm

1084
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,119
relatively easy as long as work can

1085
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:50,420
proceed

1086
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,319
area

1087
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,660
I agree with the slide I think the hard

1088
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,220
part is getting consensus because not

1089
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,660
everybody is happy about this document

1090
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,160
but the whole purpose is just

1091
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,800
documenting it

1092
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,720
I'm not saying this as an ibtrib member

1093
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,520
but like we don't have to publish it in

1094
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,660
this group if you just want to document

1095
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,099
it we can also publish it somewhere else

1096
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,619
so it's updating an IEP document so this

1097
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:16,760
is still enough for that stance

1098
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,160
Paul

1099
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,720
um so a couple of things Elliot the

1100
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,640
schemas are in the drafts

1101
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,300
so there's no reason to take them out

1102
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,680
um I I think that they're actually

1103
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,440
useful there because they're extractable

1104
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,180
and stuff like that so I wouldn't take

1105
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,500
them out

1106
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,460
um

1107
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,380
we're talking about four things right

1108
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,940
here and there's a few more

1109
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,859
presentations that are on these four

1110
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,220
things so I'm not sure what to say but

1111
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,160
I'm hearing some people say

1112
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,099
this when what they aren't actually

1113
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:55,500
talking about is just the as implemented

1114
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,300
draft it's this plus everything that

1115
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,099
comes in the future

1116
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:00,599
um some of us have thought about this so

1117
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,119
I will wait because I I think I will

1118
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,060
still have time to do it but

1119
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,020
um

1120
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,819
I don't think that

1121
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,119
this slide is actually a good slide for

1122
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,700
what we're talking about because I think

1123
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,200
what we're talking about is what do we

1124
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,700
do in general

1125
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,060
yeah okay good

1126
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:26,880
hacker yeah Erica squirrel um so

1127
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,800
I think it's trying to summarize what I

1128
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,819
think I hear people saying and

1129
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:31,859
especially Robert is we need a document

1130
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:34,260
which describes the RCs that we've

1131
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,420
already published and the rfcs we intend

1132
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,980
to publish in the period between now and

1133
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,500
we have a consensus document

1134
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,000
um that reflects a format which never

1135
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,220
had consensus but hence the Aziz nature

1136
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,079
of the story

1137
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,640
um and

1138
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,920
um so that's like the reflection

1139
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,319
um my suspicion is that trying to

1140
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,520
actually get consensus on those pieces

1141
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,079
will be very difficult because like I

1142
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,040
know people disagree with a bunch of

1143
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,700
them

1144
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,319
um and so we're gonna have to like

1145
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,819
um sort of like tease that apart which

1146
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:02,220
will be like a not trivial process

1147
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,020
um so whatever we so whatever we do I

1148
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,220
think we'll take some time to get to a

1149
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,900
document which has consensus

1150
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,099
um and I don't understand quite

1151
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:09,780
understand how we could publish

1152
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,460
this current document and then like

1153
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,560
Deltas with rfcs because like the pieces

1154
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,940
you're dealting against don't consensus

1155
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,099
that seems very confusing so

1156
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:20,099
um so I think like um again I'm not like

1157
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:21,359
um that does not take a position between

1158
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,280
RFC or not um which I think is a

1159
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,180
separate question

1160
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,560
um what I think is more relevant the

1161
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,900
question that should be an RFC is um it

1162
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,040
became clear to me in the meeting

1163
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,660
yesterday on the rsat meeting yesterday

1164
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,359
that there are some Edge conditions

1165
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,560
where

1166
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,520
um there's like disagreements

1167
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,260
potentially the tool on the document or

1168
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,700
things where the rsab will have to make

1169
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,440
short short decisions policy decisions

1170
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,420
about small pieces that might block

1171
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,339
publication in between now when this

1172
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:46,680
process is finished and so

1173
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,880
um

1174
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,560
um now um I guess my personal view is we

1175
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,640
try to keep that to a minimum but I

1176
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,680
don't think it's going to be zero and so

1177
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,960
we will need so whatever whatever we do

1178
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,720
we'll need some mechanism that allows us

1179
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,339
to that allows those changes to happen

1180
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:01,260
and to update the documents

1181
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,400
um so that we don't end up with a

1182
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,140
situation yet like if we imagine we have

1183
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,520
an RFC

1184
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,560
um and uh

1185
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,020
um and that we published in our safe and

1186
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,119
then we discover you know that there's

1187
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:13,800
like a obvious error in the

1188
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,500
specification and it has to be repaired

1189
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,300
um and and that's like not just trivial

1190
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,800
doing Errata then that has to be

1191
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,420
published somehow so like again we have

1192
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,500
a document which describes what we're

1193
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,300
actually doing and so

1194
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,980
um we will need unfortunately some my

1195
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,660
point is a maintenance mechanism for

1196
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,760
this document even if we like say

1197
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,380
congratulations to all those is document

1198
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,640
everything because that was like that

1199
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,099
quite that simple and so um so I think

1200
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,900
that but that long change of reasoning I

1201
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,800
think

1202
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,119
um leads me to like maybe better to be

1203
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,819
an idea in RC but um um but I think I

1204
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:42,960
guess what I really wanted to say was I

1205
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,740
think we're going to need a maintenance

1206
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,819
mechanism or some kind of the document

1207
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:45,900
even though maintenance is well

1208
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,920
hopefully relatively small

1209
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,559
Lawrence yeah I think I agree with lots

1210
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,220
of what Echo and others have said so so

1211
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,079
I think we're focusing way too much on

1212
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,500
publishing rfcs especially if if so so

1213
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,020
those rfcs that are the as is are they

1214
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,760
are as its documents right they're like

1215
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,819
internal working documents that we write

1216
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,859
for ourselves to make sure we're all

1217
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,760
aligned right and and as long as that's

1218
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,640
the case they never need to see RFC

1219
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,859
publication frankly right they might for

1220
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:21,900
historic reasons maybe but the point is

1221
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,760
they're working documents here and and

1222
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,160
working on them gets us to a common

1223
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,780
ground that will then let us talk about

1224
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,700
the the next version of the thing which

1225
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,040
will actually and probably be in RFC

1226
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,780
and a bunch of us here have been pretty

1227
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,740
heavily

1228
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,200
um involved in Quake right which used a

1229
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,960
very GitHub driven approach with um

1230
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,900
working documents and and issues

1231
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,280
on which we called working group

1232
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,260
consensus before they then got merged

1233
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,240
into the sort of living document that

1234
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,520
was the quick specification which we

1235
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,859
occasionally snapshotted to a submitted

1236
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:53,940
ID

1237
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,040
right and and that process I think

1238
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,420
worked well for quickly it might work

1239
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,680
well for this year because it looks like

1240
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,640
we're going to have a whole bunch of

1241
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,839
individual

1242
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:03,240
things that are in flux that need

1243
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,640
separate discussion and or Pawn

1244
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,520
resolution might then lead to a merge

1245
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,460
into the common agreed on working

1246
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,400
document right I think sort of it raises

1247
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,020
the issue of how comfortable we are with

1248
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,940
using quick very heavily but I think the

1249
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,339
the approach that quick used would work

1250
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:23,180
quite well for us

1251
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,540
hi Mike St Johns

1252
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,420
um I think we're starting to to hit the

1253
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,220
limits of what we can do with our season

1254
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,559
this particular piece of it it's sort of

1255
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,960
The Meta Meta Meta piece of it that

1256
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,940
we're dealing with here

1257
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,800
um we need

1258
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,880
we need a document that that authors can

1259
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,059
Implement can can Implement rfcs against

1260
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:49,500
we need

1261
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,800
a tracking of what the code base is

1262
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,640
doing

1263
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,280
at any given particular point in time

1264
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,859
and at some point in time those need to

1265
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:02,400
merge in some way shape or form

1266
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,280
and we need a history so that if

1267
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,280
somebody picks up an RFC 10 years down

1268
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,400
the line and sees tag foobar

1269
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,200
and they can't find a document that

1270
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,720
explains what tag Fubar is all about

1271
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,880
you know we've failed there

1272
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,460
so with respect to this I would actually

1273
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,660
support

1274
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,980
publication as a as built here's the

1275
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,040
trans hands-off Handover from the

1276
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,720
pre-race to the post rsce get that down

1277
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,220
and then figure out what we're going to

1278
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,420
do in this group with respect to the the

1279
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,040
cracking going forward and it may be

1280
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,140
that we actually do something that's

1281
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,540
more along the lines of a beta test

1282
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:49,559
model where we release the new things to

1283
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,020
a limited number of people we test them

1284
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,240
out before we then actually incorporate

1285
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,000
them into the whole system anyway

1286
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,599
I don't think that we can just say we

1287
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:02,940
can't do rfcs or we have to wait 42

1288
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,119
levels to we don't we have to do 42

1289
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:08,220
different iterations of rfcs before we

1290
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,000
get to the final one so

1291
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,859
and just we we should have warned you

1292
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:15,300
ahead of time we're getting close to

1293
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,819
time agenda wise so we went and closed

1294
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:19,079
the queue

1295
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:20,940
um but we'll let it drain here John

1296
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,420
you're up

1297
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,040
but I do think it's important to somehow

1298
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,680
establish a

1299
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,059
starting point

1300
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:41,000
um which largely agrees with my

1301
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,520
suggestion I think uh of where of where

1302
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,460
we are now uh whether that's an RFC or

1303
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,800
some other sort of document and not

1304
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,520
certain I care but it's uh it's very

1305
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,359
important to be statement and and as

1306
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,480
part of the stability issue uh I would

1307
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,819
like to understand something which has

1308
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:05,339
never been revealed to me today which is

1309
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:07,740
the what the places which are storing

1310
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,740
copies of the RFC series

1311
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,020
on the basis that it proves their

1312
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,059
archival of Nature and accessibility

1313
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:20,220
think they agreed to are they storing

1314
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,680
PDF are they storing text are they

1315
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,680
storing them out if they're starting XML

1316
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,500
what's their tolerance of change and I

1317
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,180
think understanding that stuff unless

1318
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,160
we're going to drop yard today

1319
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,040
is very important I don't think we know

1320
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,540
thanks

1321
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,859
did you want to answer that yeah

1322
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,140
hi it's John Levine um

1323
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,420
we have two archiving agreements one is

1324
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,099
with the Swedish Library which was made

1325
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:48,720
so long ago that they are only archiving

1326
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,000
text but I expect that Alexis will talk

1327
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,920
to them the archive what what we are

1328
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,440
actually publishing the other is with

1329
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,119
the Computer History Museum and they're

1330
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,680
basically using rsync to Archive

1331
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,540
whatever it is we publish and they

1332
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,460
understand that it's three formats or at

1333
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,200
least four now

1334
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,540
so the Computer History Museum is happy

1335
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,240
to replace the archival stuff that

1336
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,880
they're CA that they are storing with

1337
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,660
whatever we think the rfcs are today

1338
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,920
and then whatever we think they are

1339
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,520
tomorrow is that what you just said um

1340
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,800
at the time last time I talked to them

1341
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,079
that question hadn't come up I mean but

1342
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:28,680
I I can talk but you know it's like it's

1343
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,960
something worth addressing but documents

1344
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,400
that go through multiple versions even

1345
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,319
even very minor multiple versions are

1346
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,059
not unusual in the world and this should

1347
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,619
not be an insoluble problem

1348
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:41,460
it's not an insolutable problem but

1349
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,640
understanding whether it is possible for

1350
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,339
somebody to easily obtain a copy of an

1351
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:49,859
RFC as that RFC existed on such a

1352
00:56:49,859 --> 00:56:52,079
particular date is different from being

1353
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,059
able to obtain a copy of whatever the

1354
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:57,200
iatf thinks the RFC is if that's

1355
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,000
changing and several comments which are

1356
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,559
made today many of the comments that we

1357
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:03,780
go to list say well we just changed them

1358
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,819
update them or replace them with the

1359
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:07,440
current format or whatever the issues

1360
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,200
are and and that's where the concern

1361
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,480
lies

1362
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,460
we need to be clear whatever it is we're

1363
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,579
doing

1364
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,059
so this is Pete Resnick

1365
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:23,160
um and asking from the floor I could

1366
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,780
formulate this as a chair question but

1367
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,940
it seemed easier to do it just as a

1368
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,460
participant I've noted in the chat room

1369
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,700
there's this distinction between how we

1370
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,740
publish what form of documents how many

1371
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,460
documents and when we publish

1372
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,980
um so do we need to publish an RFC now

1373
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,440
and then one later do we publish all at

1374
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,140
the same time so one of the questions

1375
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,559
that keeps coming into my head is for

1376
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:53,400
the as is document is there a need for

1377
00:57:53,400 --> 00:58:00,000
that to be fixed at any particular time

1378
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,599
um so the discussion of for purposes of

1379
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,400
documenting history so people can

1380
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,160
recreate what the current set of

1381
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,160
documents has as a syntax is important

1382
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,339
but I don't see that as needing to

1383
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:17,579
happen now is there a purpose for the as

1384
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:22,859
is document to be fixed now or do we

1385
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:25,260
have a deprecated things that happened

1386
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,720
over the years section in whatever

1387
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,599
policy document we come up with that

1388
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:33,300
expresses what we have consensus to go

1389
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,640
forward with

1390
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,640
foreign

1391
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,520
so

1392
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,140
Martin

1393
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,359
made the

1394
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,160
um strong suggestion that anything that

1395
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,299
we would do with the grammar would

1396
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:56,099
remain Backward Compatible

1397
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,700
if we accept that as a constraint then

1398
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,619
publishing the as implemented document

1399
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:07,880
immediately is far

1400
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,099
less important

1401
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,020
um if we

1402
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,960
were to decide and if we do going

1403
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,200
forward decide no we're just going to

1404
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,720
have a breaking change

1405
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,119
then at that point publishing what

1406
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:26,460
existed before the breaking change would

1407
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,980
be an important thing to do

1408
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,900
um with the constraint that we're going

1409
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,980
to try to maintain backward

1410
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,880
compatibility in the language definition

1411
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,000
then I think that a living document

1412
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,200
approach

1413
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,260
um as we're working is fine

1414
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,260
um I will be even happier if that was

1415
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,740
expected that it would get frequent

1416
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,020
small updates and that the code could

1417
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:56,780
become more fluid than it currently is

1418
00:59:56,819 --> 01:00:00,780
that that helps me a lot just share

1419
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,000
decision wise

1420
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,180
um and and if others have thoughts that

1421
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,940
are different which is there is a reason

1422
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:13,260
to publish now as a fixed Point even if

1423
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:17,460
we were to document this history in what

1424
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,760
our final view of what should be

1425
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,960
um I'd like to hear that

1426
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:27,720
foreign just like to follow on to the a

1427
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,660
comment that that Mike made

1428
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,859
um

1429
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:33,839
the idea that we would need something

1430
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,059
that somebody could refer to 10 years

1431
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:37,880
from now to pick up and and do something

1432
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,380
that would be the final product of

1433
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,900
whatever we write right and if we're

1434
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,460
still working on that 10 years from now

1435
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,880
I'm very very sad

1436
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,960
um the uh

1437
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:56,160
so the the just keep in mind that as

1438
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,720
we're whatever we do as we're going

1439
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,640
along that

1440
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,460
that

1441
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,200
mythical

1442
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,559
some large number of years in the future

1443
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:09,540
person has to be able to answer that

1444
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,059
question and if there is a you know an

1445
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:13,680
active process around a document that

1446
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,119
can be pointed to you to answer that

1447
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,040
question great

1448
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,079
um otherwise put down something in the

1449
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:20,819
fossil record

1450
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:23,700
good area you get the last comment for

1451
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,280
today on this topic yeah I'm actually

1452
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,900
not sure what it would do with the

1453
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,819
document anymore then I was beside that

1454
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,559
like I don't think it's worse to have

1455
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:33,540
this discarded any longer it's been a

1456
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,040
hard time on that but we need a

1457
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,059
conclusion

1458
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,619
um but I wanted to comment on some

1459
01:01:37,619 --> 01:01:39,720
things about process that I heard um so

1460
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,400
like my expectation is not that we will

1461
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,780
ever reach the state where we would not

1462
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,240
be needed to do small changes right and

1463
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,740
we have a process for that unfortunately

1464
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,599
if even if you don't like it the process

1465
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:51,000
is that the rsap can decide on on things

1466
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,640
that need to be cited timely and then we

1467
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,020
have more time here to actually figure

1468
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,579
out what's the policy behind that right

1469
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,200
we have that process it's already there

1470
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,960
it was also a comment that we need to

1471
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,819
have some documentation about what the

1472
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:05,339
current tools does that's also good it's

1473
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:06,720
also not for this group that's for the

1474
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,839
RPC to do this group could at maximum

1475
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,160
figure out like that there is a

1476
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,599
requirement to have this documentation

1477
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:14,579
right so we should should make sure we

1478
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:16,140
use a new process that we just created

1479
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:18,799
in the right way

1480
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,020
excellent thanks

1481
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,819
all right

1482
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:26,460
we will call that the end of this topic

1483
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,700
for the time being and Echo and I will

1484
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,260
try and come up with a conclusion to

1485
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,660
write for the list

1486
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,440
um

1487
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,660
all right let me bring the set of slides

1488
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,740
back up

1489
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,700
uh

1490
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,819
slides am I on now

1491
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:48,920
these aren't I yes Paul

1492
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,819
come step up to the uh the big mic

1493
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:59,280
don't jump on that really

1494
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,900
what's that trap door it's a little oh

1495
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,500
no no that's right

1496
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,440
trust me I just earlier I was doing this

1497
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,059
and I looked at the red one I was like

1498
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:10,859
oh God they're gonna get rid of me now

1499
01:03:10,859 --> 01:03:12,359
um so this is going to be a bit awkward

1500
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,640
because this covers a lot of what we

1501
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,559
were talking about but in a different

1502
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,900
way so this is not going to make it any

1503
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,099
easier

1504
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:22,440
um what I'm talking about yeah so what

1505
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,799
I'm talking about here is assuming that

1506
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:28,440
whatever this draft that John has which

1507
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,900
describes how the tool works now is

1508
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,559
published or solidified somewhere

1509
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,920
we know that there's still work to do

1510
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,040
this proposal is and I'm sorry let me

1511
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,780
let me just give the reasons some of the

1512
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,000
things that are in the current document

1513
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,559
are

1514
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,160
known to be or possibly bad ideas things

1515
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,700
that really should be fixed before we do

1516
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,220
you know like we we just get up and walk

1517
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,359
away

1518
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,400
some of the things that were in 7991

1519
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,799
were removed that we may want to put

1520
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:03,780
back in they were removed for whatever

1521
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,599
reason we may want to put them back in

1522
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:09,119
um so we need to do something and I'm

1523
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,920
calling this temporarily 3.1 version 3.1

1524
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:16,940
where as implemented you can think of as

1525
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,520
3.05 or 3 x John I think you called it

1526
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,720
three plus plus something like that

1527
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:29,839
where this is beyond that next slide

1528
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:34,740
little picture time okay so

1529
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,619
um the bad ideas that are in there now

1530
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:40,040
some were introduced some some things in

1531
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,319
7991 in the fullness of time we realize

1532
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:46,619
these were bad ideas they should not be

1533
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:49,920
done in the future some of them were

1534
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,960
things that were added during the

1535
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,900
implementation of 7991 with no Community

1536
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:58,140
review or consensus which we realize now

1537
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,020
those are bad things we don't want them

1538
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,160
there now next slide

1539
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:07,559
um and then again there's some things

1540
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:09,480
that we may want back that we look and

1541
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,160
we say for whatever reason they didn't

1542
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,619
make them into the implementation we

1543
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:16,380
would like that capability so we would

1544
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:20,480
like to add them in next slide

1545
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,900
but and this is what a lot of the mic

1546
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,619
line for the last half hour has been

1547
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:30,059
um

1548
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,880
anything we do here need you know the

1549
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,380
first thing is it needs to you know

1550
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,780
change in the tooling and that can be

1551
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,540
done that's really not a hard thing

1552
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,700
um

1553
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:44,520
but I believe from what a few people

1554
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,200
said and certainly what I have believed

1555
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,400
is

1556
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,579
someone who's looking at a chunk of XML

1557
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,460
should be able to tell how to process

1558
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,319
that chunk of XML if they're looking at

1559
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:58,500
the text or the HTML or the PDF they

1560
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,240
don't need to know how they got there

1561
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,220
but if they're looking at the XML I

1562
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,140
think it would be useful if we have

1563
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:07,020
multiple ways of processing XML for

1564
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,299
somebody to say Ah that's the one could

1565
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,339
be the RFC could be the internet draft

1566
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:14,520
whatever next slide

1567
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,480
foreign

1568
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,980
and then we get to the question of

1569
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,900
archival I'm not going to try to answer

1570
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,079
it I want to make it clear though what I

1571
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,619
said here which I wrote before this is

1572
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:28,140
many people have very different views of

1573
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,640
what it means to be archival and they

1574
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,460
have strongly held views and we don't

1575
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:35,220
have consensus at all on that so I don't

1576
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,400
believe we should be doing anything that

1577
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,039
limits what that means now until there

1578
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,319
is a consensus for how how do we reach

1579
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,480
archival and as a great example that

1580
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,460
Martin you said that you expect all of

1581
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,319
the you know future changes to be

1582
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:51,780
Backward Compatible that's not a given

1583
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,539
and Robert unfortunately jumped on that

1584
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:56,220
and said okay that'll be easy if we do

1585
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,079
this and this but if we don't we have

1586
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,780
this whole other way of doing things so

1587
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,359
those kind of decisions need to be made

1588
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:06,599
explicitly before we do anything like

1589
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:09,960
what I'm suggesting here as a 3.1

1590
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,260
right we've got the as is we've got the

1591
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,000
simple things that are pretty much

1592
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,460
straight out of what we expected from

1593
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:20,160
7991 and then we have this whole other

1594
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,200
thing of you know what it would be nice

1595
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,760
if blah blah those can be done later I

1596
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,280
think what we should call or or we don't

1597
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,140
need we can call it whatever we want to

1598
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:35,099
think about as is and a 3.1 or something

1599
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:38,460
like that that is simply what we meant

1600
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,460
and what we would have meant if we had

1601
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,900
known that we you know weren't making

1602
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,059
mistakes

1603
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:47,700
publish that in the same way that we are

1604
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,579
publishing as is and then move forwards

1605
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:53,599
and I think that was it

1606
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,740
oh okay so that was the pro I'm sorry I

1607
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:58,020
just gave the proposed ways forward

1608
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,599
um and then

1609
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:03,599
one way to do the 3.1 is to have an

1610
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,539
explicit set of differences and then go

1611
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:08,940
through one by one and say yes we want

1612
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:11,579
that no we don't want that for the no we

1613
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:14,339
don't want thats that are from 7991 we

1614
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:16,020
document that we say if you're reading

1615
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:19,080
this at the same time a 7991 we

1616
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,819
explicitly took this out and maybe even

1617
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:23,640
give a reason and the reason is not the

1618
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,460
implementer of as is decided they didn't

1619
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,560
like it it's a community this community

1620
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,738
or The Wider Community consensus find

1621
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:36,120
rough consensus and then say boomf and

1622
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,560
not even think about what is archival

1623
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,140
until we're done I'm sorry not even

1624
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,540
finalize obviously we're all thinking

1625
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,399
about archival

1626
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:48,779
not finalize so that's what I've got

1627
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:51,299
all right me up here I mean because it's

1628
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:54,000
not necessarily like I don't have any

1629
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,620
actual say I think it's almost better to

1630
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:57,120
have a mic line that's that's yeah

1631
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,140
that's fine excellent thanks yes

1632
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:05,660
thank you Paul uh Phil Europe

1633
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:08,819
yeah uh I don't see any real problem

1634
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:12,359
changing the XML format because uh you

1635
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:13,259
know how many people are actually

1636
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:16,380
editing in the HTML form XML format

1637
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:20,100
well well more than you a few hands went

1638
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,779
up behind you yeah I mean yes there are

1639
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:23,040
some but you know

1640
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,679
I I edit all my stuff in Word

1641
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,560
right if anybody who wants a Windows XML

1642
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,600
to RFC I've got one of those and you can

1643
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,279
use Mountain down as well

1644
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:35,219
uh so you know for me it's just tell me

1645
01:09:35,219 --> 01:09:38,399
what the XML you want and I'll change my

1646
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,000
tooling and you know every I think

1647
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,580
everybody's using

1648
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:47,580
uh what's his name's uh carsten's uh

1649
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:50,698
till for markdown so uh you know you've

1650
01:09:50,698 --> 01:09:53,160
only got two points and you'll get 70 of

1651
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,639
us along

1652
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,639
uh Jay

1653
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,600
thanks

1654
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,179
um so Paul I'm slightly um confused by

1655
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:11,520
something two slides back

1656
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,100
um the thing about the version

1657
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:14,760
um

1658
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,420
we uh need to say in the next an adult

1659
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,800
and which grammar is used we have the

1660
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,520
version attribute of the RFC element the

1661
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,120
problem is that we only have

1662
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,640
one thing defined as three that we all

1663
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,960
know is actually 3.1 so it's not that

1664
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,960
the XML cannot do it it's that what the

1665
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,420
XML do does we do not have the right

1666
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,219
thing to point to

1667
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:44,159
if does that make sense yeah

1668
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:46,679
um and and to be clearer the definition

1669
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:51,300
in the RFC says that means 7991

1670
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:55,440
we know that none of them are 7991 so we

1671
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,260
at least have to update the meaning of

1672
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,520
that

1673
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,679
somewhere and we have to figure out what

1674
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,080
we want to do later again 3.1 is what

1675
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,020
comes after as is implemented

1676
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:10,500
so if we do anything after as is

1677
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,820
implemented which I think many people

1678
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:13,739
want to we're then going to have at

1679
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:15,960
least two flags but the first flag has

1680
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,100
to say not 7991 but this thing over here

1681
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,620
and I don't know how we will do that and

1682
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,000
where we will do it in a way that

1683
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,340
someone looking just at the XML will be

1684
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,940
able to find it

1685
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,920
I I don't think it's that complicated

1686
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,420
because there is nothing implemented

1687
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:39,659
using 7991 so every RFC that has been

1688
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:42,420
published uses whatever the new stuff is

1689
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,760
so it's simply a question of redefining

1690
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,040
three to be what yes is the current

1691
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,140
position because nothing has ever been

1692
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,420
published yeah yes under three so so we

1693
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,360
need to redefine what that one what the

1694
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,659
current tag means and just to repeat

1695
01:11:57,659 --> 01:11:59,100
what Paul just said do we need to

1696
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:02,120
redefine what the Tad means

1697
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:07,320
uh thank you uh Julian you are up

1698
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,640
hi there

1699
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,120
um I have to say that I actually ignored

1700
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,400
and missed the fact that the answer is

1701
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,239
document is last call but I'm I wasn't

1702
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,719
as calm I'm not sure where that's done

1703
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:25,440
um but I'm 100 sure that if I actually

1704
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,540
have a look at it I will find quite a

1705
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,960
few things that are not correct so

1706
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,800
um this is a warning sign that uh if we

1707
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,219
do this uh seriously I'll have to

1708
01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:41,699
actually review it and check it against

1709
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:43,860
all the bug reports that are opened

1710
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,020
against XML to RFC in the last six years

1711
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,659
and that will be quite time consuming

1712
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,620
Martin yeah I think Julian's right in in

1713
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,239
spirit but maybe not the right approach

1714
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,159
at this point given the size of the

1715
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:04,560
number of bugs that have happened it may

1716
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,000
be better to just look down the document

1717
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,580
and match them up to reality

1718
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,480
um

1719
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,760
I think the the notion that Paul has

1720
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,040
here on this slide is is kind of a

1721
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,440
little dangerous I think if you put a

1722
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,620
version 4 in the document uh a version 3

1723
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,600
process it would refuse to process it

1724
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,520
and we probably don't want that because

1725
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,560
we want to retain some amount of

1726
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,780
backward compatibility as I talked about

1727
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:28,760
before

1728
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,400
so this idea that you have some way of

1729
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,820
identifying which tool to use is fragile

1730
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,880
and I don't think that really gives the

1731
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,560
the people who are producing XML

1732
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,199
documents as input to our process it

1733
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,239
doesn't do them any favors

1734
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:47,460
but I do think that Paul's overall

1735
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,760
approach is probably unfortunately

1736
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,800
despite the fact that it is so much work

1737
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,120
um

1738
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,219
the best approach that we have here

1739
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:58,679
which is to to look at what we have now

1740
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:01,560
to look at what we had then do a do a

1741
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,760
diff

1742
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,080
go through each one of them and make

1743
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:08,100
sure that we want what we have now and

1744
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,719
and then commit to that

1745
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:11,580
I

1746
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,400
don't think we need an iotf last call or

1747
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,800
any of the other sort of rsab processes

1748
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,420
until we're certain that we want to

1749
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,820
engage with those processes but I do

1750
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:23,340
think we should periodically check in to

1751
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,960
see that we're not completely off the

1752
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,060
rails in that process and that's

1753
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,199
something that I think the chairs can

1754
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:31,280
probably work through for us

1755
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,380
uh Mike St John's again uh this is

1756
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:37,380
actually questions rather than comments

1757
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,400
um

1758
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,140
in the tool system when the rfcs are

1759
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:45,179
archived their their final process the

1760
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:47,580
last document is that do they include a

1761
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,320
pointer to the schema that's being used

1762
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,060
with respect to them

1763
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,640
they do not

1764
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,460
huh they have a version number in them

1765
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,500
yeah but no I mean there's actually

1766
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,920
there's actually meta XML to say this is

1767
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,719
the schema designed to render this

1768
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:05,400
particular thing

1769
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,620
okay so that

1770
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:10,380
let me finish

1771
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:14,040
okay the the key point is that the

1772
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,159
document that explains XML schema for

1773
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:19,440
humans isn't necessarily the document

1774
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,260
that we care about with respect to

1775
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:25,500
the archival storage piece of it so

1776
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,900
that's it so yeah

1777
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,060
yeah so so Mike the the thing that the

1778
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,739
documents contain at the moment is there

1779
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:34,980
is a comment added by XML to RFC that

1780
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,960
identifies its own version

1781
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,940
and transitively you can look up that

1782
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:41,219
version and find the exact schema that

1783
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:43,380
was used now you don't that that schema

1784
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,480
is is a machine processable thing it

1785
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,159
doesn't contain a description of the

1786
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:48,420
semantics of the fields and how it was

1787
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,620
interpreted but if you look at the code

1788
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,640
for that

1789
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,280
so it's there currently

1790
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,159
it's a little imperfect I guess but but

1791
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:59,219
it's pretty reliable I think

1792
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:01,260
yeah sure

1793
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,480
the the comment here is that the old

1794
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,400
text versions the text version stood by

1795
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,280
themselves the XML versions have this

1796
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,980
other piece of

1797
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:12,239
knowledge that has to go along with it

1798
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:16,020
for the syntax and then the semantics or

1799
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:18,659
the third document of the you know

1800
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:20,760
here's what we mean by C ref for example

1801
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,400
right so

1802
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:27,000
Ecker yeah from the floor um so I just

1803
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,340
like about taking a position on sort of

1804
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:31,440
the exact thing that Paul suggested

1805
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,179
um it's important to recognize that

1806
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:34,800
there are two different standards for

1807
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,500
the Aziz document and this 3.1 document

1808
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,800
the server for the address document is

1809
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,659
as closely as possible or Flex what the

1810
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:45,179
tool actually does and

1811
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:47,040
um because the one thing we know with

1812
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,900
some level of certainty is the dot is it

1813
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,120
the is that the tool correctly process

1814
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,219
the XML documents that we've already

1815
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:55,560
published published

1816
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:59,460
um and so well I mean one version of the

1817
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,739
tool data which would developes in the

1818
01:17:01,739 --> 01:17:02,880
first place

1819
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,500
um and

1820
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:05,340
um

1821
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:08,699
and the standard of

1822
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:11,159
um and the standard for the 3.1 things

1823
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:13,500
such as it is is do we actually like the

1824
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,480
stuff that's in this grammar as opposed

1825
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,300
to is this correct and so I think we do

1826
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,100
need some kind of process for we do some

1827
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,020
kind of process it sounds like from the

1828
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,140
Xena Martin and Julian for going through

1829
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,080
the as this document and confirming the

1830
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,219
belief that everything in there

1831
01:17:29,219 --> 01:17:31,620
accurately reflects the tool

1832
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,780
um and I don't know if we it was called

1833
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,460
for that frankly um I don't think we

1834
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,659
probably do because like as far as I can

1835
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:37,860
tell by four people who actually you're

1836
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,360
like we're gonna do this work

1837
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,260
um

1838
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,060
um and again like I'm sure we'll find

1839
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,140
later some things where it's accurate

1840
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:44,219
we'll have to fix those but like the

1841
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:46,440
point is these accurate as possible

1842
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,100
um

1843
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,300
um so I'd like to get through that part

1844
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,159
as fast as we can and

1845
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,199
um and you know I think you know when I

1846
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:53,940
if I heard Martin and Julian say they

1847
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,900
were pretty happy and I thought it was

1848
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,340
accurate like I'd feel pretty good about

1849
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,179
that

1850
01:17:57,179 --> 01:17:57,960
um

1851
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,219
um I'm not sure Hulse is like really

1852
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:01,679
going to do that I'm not um

1853
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,420
um homosexual you said

1854
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,080
um

1855
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,239
um and I'm assuming John's already

1856
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:07,199
happened with others he wouldn't have

1857
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:08,880
you know because he just said so earlier

1858
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:09,719
um

1859
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,340
um and then I think you know and I think

1860
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:12,600
we do have to go through this process

1861
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,159
that some process the kind that Paul

1862
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:16,080
indicated of going through each Delta

1863
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,880
and and forming an opinion with like

1864
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,320
those dolls over or not

1865
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,520
um but then but I think the starting

1866
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,380
point ought to be like convincing

1867
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:23,820
ourselves to some level of certainty

1868
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,679
that this the current document is like

1869
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,540
is an accurate description in a

1870
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,320
non-normative sense

1871
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,820
foreign

1872
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:35,719
J

1873
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:40,739
I just want to go back to the schema and

1874
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:43,260
syntax comment earlier from Mike and

1875
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,580
things

1876
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:48,420
um when a an XML document is published

1877
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:52,260
schema no longer matters because you

1878
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,440
know at that point we make an explicit

1879
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,860
guarantee that we have validated that

1880
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,780
document against that schema that's it's

1881
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:03,500
the final product it's done it's there

1882
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,920
and when someone parses that they don't

1883
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,080
need the the schema to do that with they

1884
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,420
just parse it as XML that's the purpose

1885
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:17,460
of XML what you need is a unambiguous

1886
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:21,179
identifier to the human meaning of those

1887
01:19:21,179 --> 01:19:24,000
XML elements and the attributes and

1888
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,659
things and that's the important bit that

1889
01:19:27,659 --> 01:19:31,679
needs to be encoded inside the

1890
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:34,620
um inside the XML so that we know that

1891
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,780
when because in how many years time when

1892
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:40,260
people see a t in Brackets you know to

1893
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,600
tell them that means text because that's

1894
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,820
a relatively unique thing that we do

1895
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,679
okay or some of the other things so

1896
01:19:46,679 --> 01:19:48,900
that's the bit that we need to make sure

1897
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:53,280
we do is maintain the a consistent

1898
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,860
semantics about the use of these

1899
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:58,260
elements and if there was one way I

1900
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,699
think that we would

1901
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:02,659
determine when we do a major change

1902
01:20:02,659 --> 01:20:06,239
version change from three to four it's

1903
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,820
when we break the semantic meaning of

1904
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:11,460
certain things so that that's a very

1905
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:13,080
clear indicator to people that that

1906
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,559
changes

1907
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,140
Paul you're up to that

1908
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,540
so one thing I didn't want to put in

1909
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:24,719
here much was to talk about four

1910
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,420
what I want to emphasize is that what

1911
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:30,719
I'm proposing here is just compare again

1912
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,940
7991

1913
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,920
there are lots of things that people

1914
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,800
want and for or or in something beyond

1915
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,739
that and I'm proposing that if when

1916
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:42,300
someone comes with a great idea that we

1917
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,600
all like we still say no not now

1918
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,179
hold that because if we start putting

1919
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:49,860
those in even though they're additive

1920
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,480
and it wouldn't change things like that

1921
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,000
we will never finish and we will start

1922
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,980
doing like what happens in every other

1923
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,679
freaking working group in the ietf where

1924
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:00,540
it's just like but I have this really

1925
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,219
good idea and people agree that it's

1926
01:21:02,219 --> 01:21:03,540
really a good idea and then you never

1927
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,300
finish and by the time you do finish the

1928
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,880
fourth good idea actually con

1929
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,960
contradicted the second one and you

1930
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,000
didn't notice it so I want to emphasize

1931
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,760
that but to also to talk to what Jay

1932
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,739
just said

1933
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:21,360
even though the schema can be ignored we

1934
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:25,699
in however we did 7991 and Friends

1935
01:21:25,699 --> 01:21:27,840
assumed that the schema and the

1936
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,199
semantics were intimately tied I don't

1937
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,659
want to see that break happen I want to

1938
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:36,179
see the scheme schema and the semantics

1939
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:39,719
in the same document that someone can

1940
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:42,780
look at and then see them breaking out

1941
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:46,140
the schema is technically possible

1942
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,199
but it will not help anybody in the

1943
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,280
future

1944
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,980
so two things from chair one we're going

1945
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,300
to close the mic line very soon because

1946
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,719
we're running out of time two if anybody

1947
01:21:57,719 --> 01:21:59,159
um obviously hearing General positivity

1948
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:01,260
about Paul's proposal to do you know

1949
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,179
serve a 3.1 that is kind of like a

1950
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:05,040
consensified version of three point of

1951
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,179
the current thing

1952
01:22:06,179 --> 01:22:07,320
um if anybody would like to speak to

1953
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,360
Jumping directly to like a substantial

1954
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,520
remake of this it is not necessarily not

1955
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,020
compatible like Now's the Time to be in

1956
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,380
the microphone

1957
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,280
so people keep saying

1958
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,840
um they have concerns that the current

1959
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,460
as implemented draft is not accurate or

1960
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:24,600
even claiming that there's something

1961
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,280
wrong on the draft can we just create a

1962
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,320
design team and let those people do the

1963
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,640
work and actually figure out what we

1964
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,760
have

1965
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:35,040
foreign

1966
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,960
yeah I was actually thinking very much

1967
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,640
along the lines of miria but I was going

1968
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,159
to put a more a a finer point on it

1969
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:49,980
which is can we uh in order to get

1970
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:53,040
through this process uh is it possible

1971
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,380
to bring to bear some RPC resources as

1972
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:58,020
well as some tool teams resources so

1973
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:01,739
that we can we can start to to quickly

1974
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:05,400
close on the that 3.1 dock so that we

1975
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,020
can move things forward relatively

1976
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,380
quickly

1977
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:16,920
excuse me Paul uh uh sorry for the

1978
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,239
heart palpitations there

1979
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,019
mark

1980
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,360
so I apologize I had a conflicting

1981
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,699
meeting so I missed most of this

1982
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:32,280
um but I do think people were saying

1983
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,960
that I may have had positions and I want

1984
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,900
to clarify that I I don't have a problem

1985
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,600
with publishing and as is you know as

1986
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,219
it's implemented document

1987
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:43,380
I think that's probably a useful and

1988
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:45,900
necessary thing because right now the

1989
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,640
state of things is pretty bad

1990
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,440
what I have a problem with is if that

1991
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,260
document is is portrayed as something

1992
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,620
that is not it it is not the process you

1993
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,060
know the the result of a consensus

1994
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,400
process it's not supported by multiple

1995
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,860
tools it's you know the state of the

1996
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:03,360
tools the state of where we are now what

1997
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,040
we're publishing now and it should be a

1998
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,780
pinpoint in time and I'd like the title

1999
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,219
and and the framing the document to

2000
01:24:08,219 --> 01:24:09,900
reflect that as long as we do that I'm

2001
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,940
cool what I really don't want to happen

2002
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:14,219
is is to use people to use that

2003
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:16,800
publication as an excuse to say oh well

2004
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,320
we can't consider this or or we're done

2005
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,420
now or we're not interested in this I

2006
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:22,500
think we do need to have a separate

2007
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,020
conversation I I don't think you know we

2008
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:27,120
can do more than one thing at a time we

2009
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,620
can gather issues on and have a

2010
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,900
discussion in the background of what

2011
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,420
else we might do in the future it just

2012
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,580
shouldn't impact this document this

2013
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:39,179
should be a relatively mechanical thing

2014
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:43,020
make sense yeah I think some of what you

2015
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:45,179
said might be Obe from what was

2016
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:47,280
discussed earlier

2017
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,159
um but as I said before I think Ecker

2018
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,600
and I need to kind of put our heads

2019
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,600
together and summarize the issues that

2020
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,880
we heard come out of this after John uh

2021
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,300
gets the minutes out but yes I I what

2022
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,980
you said makes sense there's a couple of

2023
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:04,020
bits that I think probably everybody

2024
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:06,840
agrees to now that didn't maybe I'm more

2025
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,880
than happy to be agreed with put that on

2026
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,560
the record

2027
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,440
Robert you get the last words of the day

2028
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,360
other than us you know if I don't blow

2029
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,560
anything up

2030
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,920
um I have to vehemently disagree with a

2031
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,320
strong point that Paul made at the mic a

2032
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,380
moment ago which is the no we're not

2033
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:27,659
going to consider any new things until

2034
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:31,140
we get all the way to the 3-1 all right

2035
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,600
that's untenable we just cannot do that

2036
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,120
we have we have

2037
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,560
maybe you weren't here at the beginning

2038
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,960
of the meeting I'll Pony up the the

2039
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:44,100
question of the yes thank you

2040
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,420
of

2041
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,699
this change to the way we represent

2042
01:25:47,699 --> 01:25:49,679
names that I'm talking about

2043
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,480
that does not need to sit for years

2044
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,600
until we get to 3-1

2045
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,120
and it may take years for us to get to

2046
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,500
3-1

2047
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:02,040
so we will have things that need to move

2048
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,280
forward

2049
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:07,560
clarifying question when you say we will

2050
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,880
have names is that changing the

2051
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:12,900
um

2052
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,260
syntax the semantics or the output

2053
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,760
generated

2054
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,940
probably all three oh I didn't realize

2055
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:23,040
it would actually change the first two

2056
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,440
what do so you feel like we need a

2057
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,380
change to the syntax to deal with names

2058
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:29,820
the way you want

2059
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:32,639
we probably do yes then yeah okay I

2060
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:34,620
would say put it off I hear that you say

2061
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:35,760
don't

2062
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,620
yeah

2063
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:40,320
and by the way I like yes lots of us

2064
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,300
want that so you may have changed my

2065
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:45,080
mind about it

2066
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,280
okay

2067
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,020
um we are a few minutes till end of time

2068
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:55,620
so plan of action here a lot was said

2069
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,940
here that I think needs to be uh uh

2070
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:03,000
analyzed and down to what points people

2071
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,659
were making so John will put out his

2072
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:09,000
notes we'll get those out on the list

2073
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,760
please make corrections as you see

2074
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,219
appropriate we'll finalize some minutes

2075
01:27:14,219 --> 01:27:17,219
but we'll also come up with sort of a an

2076
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:18,960
issue summary I think

2077
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,000
so that

2078
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,060
if anybody disagrees with our analysis

2079
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:27,480
of the issues they can give a Yelp and

2080
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,280
then we'll try and start making some

2081
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:33,060
calls on the list for ways forward this

2082
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:33,960
was

2083
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,060
incredibly enlightening and helpful to

2084
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:36,960
me

2085
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,100
so uh it crystallized a bunch of issues

2086
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:43,500
uh anything else any other business

2087
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:47,360
since we do have three minutes left

2088
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
oh

2089
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:54,420
okay

2090
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,320
yeah that's a good point

2091
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,600
okay yeah I think so too okay but you

2092
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,600
can go meet her later I I did ask uh so

2093
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,820
on the list I no I guess I asked to the

2094
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:08,600
chairs and I and I'll ask can we

2095
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,699
consider the tempo in which we're

2096
01:28:11,699 --> 01:28:13,260
working

2097
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,580
um

2098
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,380
I I think

2099
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:20,760
we you know you hear Robert's desire to

2100
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,940
move forward I think my desire to help

2101
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:26,639
you know if if we want to do this as is

2102
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,080
to try and get this closed I I I'd ask

2103
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:34,199
as a stream manager I'd ask that we take

2104
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:36,300
a certain amount of alacrity towards how

2105
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,159
we're doing things and if it means

2106
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,739
interims it means interims but let's not

2107
01:28:40,739 --> 01:28:42,780
you know let's try and Advance work I

2108
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:45,000
think everybody here has a lot of pent

2109
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,100
up energy and I don't want to lose that

2110
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:50,280
energy in terms of of the you know

2111
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,780
waiting for months and months on

2112
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:54,900
analysis so let's figure out uh some

2113
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,239
some modes of work that that where we

2114
01:28:57,239 --> 01:28:59,460
can rapidly move forward

2115
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,440
um I won't get into details as to how I

2116
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,360
don't even know what they are but I'd

2117
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,159
ask the chairs to take that off no I I

2118
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:07,440
appreciate that and

2119
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,199
um you know my schedule has been funky

2120
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:12,000
prior to this

2121
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,659
um and after my holiday next week I I've

2122
01:29:15,659 --> 01:29:19,139
got times so I will commit to getting

2123
01:29:19,139 --> 01:29:21,780
together the summary of this

2124
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:25,860
uh week after next and

2125
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,139
um then after a little bit of discussion

2126
01:29:28,139 --> 01:29:29,520
on the list let's figure out if we need

2127
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,340
an interim we're going to have in just a

2128
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,159
few weeks uh probably close to a month

2129
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:37,020
where assorted people disappear from

2130
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:38,340
Earth

2131
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,360
um for assorted holiday thing so uh but

2132
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,280
I will try and give it a hard kick

2133
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,739
myself yeah thanks Pete just to follow

2134
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:50,280
up and also to consider what resources

2135
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,360
you need

2136
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,820
right what resources we need whether

2137
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:57,060
Alexis can help in this regard

2138
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,880
um Robert what resources you either need

2139
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,400
or can bring to bear in order to help

2140
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,560
move us to conclude that as is as

2141
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,060
quickly as possible I don't want to

2142
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:08,760
stalling on on that for too long so as

2143
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,760
much as we can identify what we need

2144
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,480
right and I mean part of this I mean as

2145
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:18,179
you describe conclude the as is I will

2146
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,159
take that as conclude the as is

2147
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:24,120
discussion because what I'm not clear on

2148
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,600
is after this discussion whether people

2149
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,139
have decided that they need a particular

2150
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:33,420
document a particular place to document

2151
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:35,760
some stuff that will come out in an RFC

2152
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,159
eventually what the result is that

2153
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:40,219
people actually

2154
01:30:40,219 --> 01:30:43,860
desire I think once we all come to that

2155
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,239
conclusion and I think we can do that

2156
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:48,480
relatively quickly uh and in parallel

2157
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,780
exactly and then we can uh figure out

2158
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,980
what next steps to move forward

2159
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,320
speed and flexibility because if we

2160
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,820
don't have that we might end up in

2161
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:01,679
situations where things escalate from

2162
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:04,440
the RPC side right for example on names

2163
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,820
right what if we have an author it

2164
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:07,380
refuses a document to be published with

2165
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:09,239
what they consider an incorrect name for

2166
01:31:09,239 --> 01:31:11,520
them but that would then require the

2167
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,100
rsap to take action and punt it and it

2168
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,260
would make it complicated so speed and

2169
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,760
flexibility will save us from a lot of

2170
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,980
these pains so

2171
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,320
that was another question that I had now

2172
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,500
we're one minute over which is

2173
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,639
it do we have some mechanism for this

2174
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:33,120
group to deal with something that is

2175
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,760
less than an emergency that are that

2176
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,179
rsab just has to deal with

2177
01:31:39,179 --> 01:31:41,719
um but we can do some sort of short

2178
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:44,760
Community Last Call on a decision needs

2179
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,020
to be made here and I don't know what

2180
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:48,360
the answer to that is

2181
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,600
I think the answer is no

2182
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,280
we don't set up anything about our step

2183
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,840
to take responsibility on the on the

2184
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:55,980
emergency thing and everything that

2185
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:57,719
isn't an emergency by default yours but

2186
01:31:57,719 --> 01:31:59,400
and then you decide what you prioritize

2187
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:03,060
but right yeah I I as I read 9280 and

2188
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,500
someone contradiction if I'm wrong the

2189
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:05,699
rule is that we'd have to publish like

2190
01:32:05,699 --> 01:32:06,900
an RFC

2191
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:10,380
um and maybe I think I think if the rsat

2192
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:11,580
finds us something to make a lot of math

2193
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,980
decisions that may be ratified that

2194
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:15,360
really should be ratified by us then

2195
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,460
what the Rev 9280 to make that possible

2196
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:20,280
okay just to add it's not emergency or

2197
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:23,340
non-emergency it's is there something in

2198
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:25,620
the current policy the current rfcs that

2199
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:28,920
needs interpreting you know so I I don't

2200
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:31,020
believe the rsap has the ability to add

2201
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:33,060
a new element for example that's not

2202
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:35,040
interpreting a policy and so some stuff

2203
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,679
just falls in the Gap in that it could

2204
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:40,980
be urgent and require something new and

2205
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,659
therefore it has to follow the rswg

2206
01:32:42,659 --> 01:32:43,920
process even if that's going to take

2207
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,420
some time okay

2208
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:50,400
all right with that

2209
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,620
off to get a snack I think it's not or

2210
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:54,440
at least coffee yeah

2211
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:58,580
thank you all thank you

2212
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:11,540
yes sir
