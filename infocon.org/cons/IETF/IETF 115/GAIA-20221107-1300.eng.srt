1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,220
foreign

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,679
Jared how about we carry on with you

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,640
I'll keep time and um take some notes so

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,859
over to you Jared to present on

5
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,660
connecting Michigan what was Vibra to

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,260
Jared's house

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,140
uh yeah if you can go to the next slide

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,480
so I'm Jared moch I work at I'm a

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,980
principal Network architect over at

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,280
Akamai Technologies in my day job uh and

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,320
uh you know I've been around doing

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,899
internet networking stuff for uh you

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,660
know for uh a number of years uh if

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,920
you're into any of the operator

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,239
communities or something like that

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,280
you've probably seen me there

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,100
um you know and so I've worked you know

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,379
I've been around since uh you know I

19
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,539
would dial up with you know slip and PPP

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,480
into Unix machines directly uh and kind

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,340
of lived through you know many of the

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,520
technology uh Transitions and uh you

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,780
know uh you know uh and as luck would

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,220
have it I now also own a telephone

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,040
company uh you know that I run on on the

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,540
side so if we could have next slide

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,960
um so you know when when you don't have

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,340
good internet access a lot of people

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,900
they spend a lot of time doing research

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,700
and trying to figure out like what you

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,700
can do uh you know after you know many

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,619
years of living actually behind

33
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,979
um either a T1 line that uh uh when I

34
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,460
worked at NTT they provided me or um

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,960
you know eventually behind a wireless

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,840
ISP uh for about 10 years or so I had

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,840
access from one of their towers uh and

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,759
uh you know I went to not you know like

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,560
like anyone I've lived in my house for

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,079
for a while and having a T1 at home you

41
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,880
know in the early 2000s was great you

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,799
know it's a nice uh you know a nice

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,780
symmetrical speed and stuff like that

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,520
um but this was this was a recent

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,979
screenshot off of uh you know att's

46
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,780
website they're offering speeds up to

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,200
1.5 megabits per second uh so you know

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,380
up to that T1 speed that I had you know

49
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,840
20 years ago at my house uh and stuff

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,840
like that so I uh I I decided to do

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,580
something else uh next slide

52
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,940
so uh so I went and I I uh you know uh

53
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,860
there have been a couple of media news

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,120
coverage things about this so I actually

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,620
have gone I've built you know I built

56
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,379
fiber to my house actually in 2020. uh

57
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,800
last year in 2021 I actually built uh

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,440
you know another about four miles or so

59
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,560
of fiber uh to go and uh build out past

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,780
another about 50 homes or something like

61
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,920
that which about doubled my network

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,099
footprint uh and you know customers

63
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,959
actually you know took internet access

64
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,000
from some random guy who sold it to them

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
on the street

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,420
um you know and uh and stuff like that

67
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,099
and sent them uh you know letters in the

68
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,200
mail uh the take rate of selling

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,000
residential internet access is slightly

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,660
over 50 in a lot of these rural areas

71
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,000
um I'm offering stuff for like a pretty

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,860
reasonable price like my base plan is

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,440
about 65 a month uh and then I go up

74
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,840
from there to you know about 140 if you

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,640
want symmetrical gig

76
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,560
um and I also you know have gone and

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,659
done fiber swaps with some of the uh

78
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,159
other carriers when I was building this

79
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,819
2021 portion of my network there was a

80
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,340
company that builds out for one of the

81
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,780
um one of the big three cellular

82
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,080
companies in the US in Michigan and they

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,360
were I bumped into one of their people

84
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,519
doing all the field work and research

85
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,980
for their permitting process and said oh

86
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,080
well I'm already building you know fiber

87
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,819
along this route and in conduit and

88
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,459
underground and stuff like that so we

89
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,319
you know we talked back and forth and

90
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,000
eventually you know negotiated fiber

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,640
swap so because I I basically had the

92
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,440
middle mile portion between two cell

93
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
towers that we're trying to connect for

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,519
their customers and so from that I was

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,860
able to actually get access I uh you

96
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,239
know and extend my network footprint

97
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,739
another about two and a half miles as

98
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,560
well uh and go and uh you know provide

99
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,959
access to to other people's as well

100
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,360
um when you know if you're ever building

101
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,599
you know uh you know uh an underground

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,480
or uh you know any sort of underground

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,700
utility or something like that

104
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,959
absolutely the number one lesson I would

105
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,000
have for anyone is to always build extra

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,459
conduits the the materials on the

107
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,560
Conduit cost almost nothing and the

108
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,479
labor is so much of a high portion of

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,759
that cost and that conduit is incredibly

110
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,680
valuable so because I had built two

111
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,020
conduits on that route I was able to

112
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,780
come back and uh I built two conduits

113
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,280
part of that route was built in 2020

114
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,919
part of it was built in 2021 that I did

115
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,139
the fiber swap on uh that let me come

116
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,400
back and just place a higher account

117
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,100
Cable in that in that other conduit uh

118
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,360
and I still haven't had to actually go

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,759
and do the network cut over uh you know

120
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,560
to go and put everyone on that that new

121
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,780
or higher account cable uh you know just

122
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,520
because it takes some time and effort to

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,120
groom that but but it's it's one of the

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,699
things where uh it's it's there in place

125
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,139
and I can always do that and then free

126
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,660
up that original conduit again uh so if

127
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,940
I ever wanted to put a higher uh you

128
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,280
know like an even higher count um you

129
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,860
know cable there uh and I also you know

130
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,860
I take advantage of a lot of other

131
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,500
um construction activities so uh att's

132
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
the incumbent uh in my market and they

133
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,360
were going and they were replacing uh

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,100
they paid a contractor to replace a

135
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,780
section of their underground copper

136
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,840
cable and I went out and uh negotiated

137
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,460
with the contractor who was doing that

138
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,900
work and since I'm a registered

139
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,460
Telephone Company in Michigan I was able

140
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,960
to go and get a conduit placed on that

141
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,940
route as well at the same time for a

142
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,860
discounted labor rate

143
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,300
um and so you know just being

144
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,820
intelligent and observant you know

145
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,139
around your environment it really

146
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,680
allowed me to take advantage of uh of

147
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,180
many of those things to go and build out

148
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,560
my network

149
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,860
um so yeah I think uh next slide please

150
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,720
so you know this is what I ended up

151
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,580
building in 2021

152
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,440
um so you know uh just the conduit

153
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,060
routes uh you know in that middle there

154
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,060
there's basically uh every almost every

155
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,340
place where you see it say HH that's a

156
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,720
like underground hand hole or something

157
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,580
that's at grade

158
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,320
um you know where you know the fiber is

159
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,780
coiled in or something like that

160
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,180
um and most of them are you know nearby

161
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,120
a home uh and you can see on some of

162
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,940
these like the the roads in in much of

163
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,699
the US uh are especially in the rural

164
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,199
area are generally laid out in a mild

165
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,240
grid and so you basically have a mile

166
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,220
between these roads there

167
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,080
um and there's you know in some of these

168
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,460
cases there's three homes per mile

169
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,300
um you know and uh you know ended up

170
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,520
going and building out down you know out

171
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,620
down this road and then once I got down

172
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,199
down close to this uh you know this road

173
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,240
here you see kind of on the left

174
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,919
um that was an area that our County had

175
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,960
identified that my County had identified

176
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,479
that there was a uh there was a gap in

177
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,979
the Broadband access between all the

178
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,960
different um funding that that exists in

179
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,160
the U.S

180
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,660
um because there's been all this uh

181
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,639
money given for um there's connect

182
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,340
America fund connect CAF 2 there's

183
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,900
ardoff which is the rural development

184
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,520
opportunity fund there's a second round

185
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,259
of that and there's also state level

186
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,139
initiatives and and such but they'd

187
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,759
identified that a number of these homes

188
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,380
there were also not going to be able to

189
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,880
be connected

190
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,900
um through any of those existing

191
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,199
programs and uh I was able to convince

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,000
the people there to

193
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,740
um put some money in up front you know

194
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,380
to cover my construction Labor uh I

195
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,560
covered the the materials costs uh and

196
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,360
asked them to basically just prepay for

197
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
their internet access for a couple years

198
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,539
uh and was able to go and build another

199
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,240
you you know about a mile mile and a

200
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
half or so if fiber network is a result

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,560
um and and this has really been

202
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
something where it's been game changing

203
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,340
for you know many of these individual

204
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,840
families to go and get that internet

205
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
access at you know at their home uh

206
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,539
something I have next slide

207
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,580
um and then you know like I said my

208
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,340
county put up stuff for RFP so had this

209
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,220
they sent out this RFI you know an RFP

210
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,240
you know back in 2021. it took almost a

211
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,199
year

212
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,520
um actually I didn't update this slide

213
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,380
but uh it took almost a year I ended up

214
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,300
signing the contract and getting my

215
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,180
counter signed copy back in June uh of

216
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,580
this year so it took almost exactly a

217
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,360
year uh from the time that they you know

218
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,800
from working with the government that

219
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,060
they actually went and they came back

220
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,039
and they said uh yes we're actually

221
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,680
willing to sign you know like how to

222
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,060
fully execute contract so I could go

223
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,220
forward and start building uh you know

224
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,500
even more fiber Network and so I I was

225
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,419
lucky enough to be awarded about 2.6

226
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,679
million dollars

227
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,958
to basically cover all the construction

228
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,620
costs to build out to another 400 about

229
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,240
412 homes or so

230
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,380
next slide

231
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,420
um yeah so you know I you know I've you

232
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,339
know I've had good success going in um

233
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:51,240
you know

234
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,000
um building a lot of this stuff uh you

235
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,920
know uh and because we had built in some

236
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,060
of these areas we actually got them

237
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,740
excluded from the county Gap filling

238
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,000
project

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,740
um you know because one of the most

240
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,660
important things in doing a doing a big

241
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,740
project like this is actually

242
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,399
communicating and letting people know

243
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,019
that what you're doing it's not just the

244
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,540
technical execution of the project

245
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,100
um but so much of it is about just

246
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,959
marketing making people aware that the

247
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,880
service is available

248
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,500
um and going and the number one

249
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,760
marketing tool is actually a

250
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,899
construction crew out in front of

251
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,959
somebody's house uh you'll get about

252
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,000
40 of the people who will sign up before

253
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,279
you know maybe a little bit less but the

254
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,720
second they actually see something going

255
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,459
in front of their house and Crews

256
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,620
working there uh and the survey Stakes

257
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,959
everybody you know it's like comes out

258
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
they talk to construction Crews and you

259
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,620
uh you hand the construction Crews

260
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,180
little Flyers

261
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,980
um to hand hand back to the people and

262
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,420
say oh well we're the ones who are

263
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,399
building it we're the contractor but you

264
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,540
know here's the person to call to get

265
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,800
internet access

266
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,480
uh and that's that's worked out really

267
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,100
well uh next slide

268
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,660
so anybody who's worked in the US and

269
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,920
tried to go and look at any of the

270
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,620
Broadband availability Maps uh the FCC

271
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,600
Maps today have really lacked the

272
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,860
Fidelity

273
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,120
um there's new maps that are supposed to

274
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,980
be going online I think

275
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,240
actually I think they were supposed to

276
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,420
have gone online this past Friday

277
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,600
um so what ha what happened is a lot of

278
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,820
these were based on existing boundaries

279
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,399
and being the federal government

280
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,620
they used the sen the the census

281
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,260
boundaries so they would go and say if

282
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,660
anybody in this census tract or census

283
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,860
block

284
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,140
um has access to the internet that's

285
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,440
counted as served unfortunately when you

286
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,240
get into some of these rural areas

287
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,279
that censorship block

288
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,320
may be very big

289
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,839
and if somebody is at one end of it and

290
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,339
somebody's at the other end there they

291
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,920
might be a mile or more apart uh you're

292
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,740
missing a lot of that that information

293
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,440
um and Washington County where I live

294
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,880
they actually went and they paid

295
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,920
somebody to go around and drive to each

296
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,980
one of there's about 113 000 Parcels in

297
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,380
our County and drove to each one of

298
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,600
those parcels and looked to see signs of

299
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
infrastructure be it cable TV

300
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,360
um you know the uh the DSL cabinets the

301
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,839
amplifiers for the vdsl and such uh you

302
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,700
know and you know and or you know stuff

303
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,200
like fiber on the poles and stuff like

304
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,519
that be either from a long distance

305
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,240
carrier or for somebody who does access

306
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,339
um and because of this the you know

307
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,680
since before 2010

308
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,899
it had shown that I had I had Broadband

309
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,180
availability at my home which I knew was

310
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,860
not the case because if I had Broadband

311
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,240
availability at my home I would have had

312
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,220
to have built it myself

313
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,860
but these Maps they're getting better uh

314
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,320
there's the there was this new

315
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,540
um broadband data collection thing uh

316
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,300
called the BD it's the BDC

317
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,800
um and like I said I think those Maps

318
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,260
went online last Friday because they had

319
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,360
sent an email telling us all to check

320
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,339
make sure our Maps were correct

321
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,200
um you know for the areas I served and a

322
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,700
lot of the white a lot of the smaller

323
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,380
providers who delivered service were

324
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,480
Wireless they had to fret over a lot of

325
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,399
this because there's

326
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,620
um there's a potential at least

327
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,940
eventually that you're gonna have to

328
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,940
have a fresh a PE sign off on that and

329
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,200
that includes if you're delivering

330
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,640
service wirelessly and not a

331
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,680
facilities-based carrier

332
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,680
you have to uh certify uh the wireless

333
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,899
propagation that you did a study that

334
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:25,860
the wireless signal will actually

335
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,839
propagate through whatever is there be

336
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,060
it trees buildings or whatever to go and

337
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,500
Reach people

338
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,300
um really to kind of disadvantage you

339
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,920
know because I think many people they

340
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,420
had said oh well we have a tower there

341
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,579
we can deliver speeds and they might

342
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:39,899
have had an advertised speed that was

343
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,060
really high but the actual throughput

344
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,399
was actually very low once you you know

345
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,320
once you go through like penetrate uh

346
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,839
the pine needles or you know or any sort

347
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,220
of leaves

348
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,480
um yeah so we have next slide

349
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,620
um so this this was where my County

350
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,480
identified the gaps were it's actually

351
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,519
you know a lot of locations scattered

352
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,079
around

353
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,139
um and as a result uh you know many of

354
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,480
these people like you know they're right

355
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,700
next to very populated areas Ann Arbor

356
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,519
is a very big location uh you know and

357
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,440
there's nothing inside of Ann Arbor that

358
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,060
was counted as unserved but you could

359
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,740
see all of these areas around these

360
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,839
communities surrounding it uh many of

361
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,639
them did not actually have any access to

362
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,200
broadband

363
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,880
um just because

364
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,160
you know there may be density there but

365
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,860
in between where the other pockets of

366
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,420
density are

367
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,399
um there wasn't a lot of opportunity and

368
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,139
some of this is driven by public policy

369
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,519
so

370
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,620
um uh Ann Arbor the city of Ann Arbor

371
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,959
and uh about 20 years ago Pastor

372
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,519
Greenbelt initiative where they went

373
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,079
around and they bought easements on all

374
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,519
of the property around the city to kind

375
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,040
of provide a buffer against development

376
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,399
which is great if you want to kind of

377
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,139
preserve that area from you know being

378
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,720
further developed and not you know build

379
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
up to be a major Metropolis but at the

380
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,920
same time that also creates further gaps

381
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,480
and boundaries between the

382
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,920
infrastructure that people in these

383
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,139
rural communities may also need and so

384
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,120
it's it's an interesting double-edged

385
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,100
sword when you talk about those types of

386
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,540
things and and I mentioned that because

387
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,100
a number of those initiatives because

388
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,380
there were 20 years

389
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,940
um in the making they're actually I

390
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,000
think they're up for uh you know uh uh

391
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,620
on the ballot uh at least in my area uh

392
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,959
tomorrow to be voted on to for them to

393
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
be renewed and to see if you want to

394
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,380
have you know do you want to go and

395
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,420
continue to preserve these green spaces

396
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,180
or do you want them to be developed

397
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,620
um so yeah let's go have next slide

398
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,720
please

399
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,480
um so also the the county when they sent

400
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,860
these things out

401
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,720
um you know they went and they they

402
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,380
didn't actually use the data from their

403
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,899
own study for some of the the addresses

404
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,940
that they put up for bid and this is an

405
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,399
example of a community where one half of

406
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,959
it showed us Broadband available and the

407
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,699
other half did it and this is a trailer

408
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,339
park that you know has you know

409
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,540
obviously you know 120 plus trailers in

410
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,079
it and has Comcast coax available there

411
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,000
but

412
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,740
some of the addresses aren't shown as

413
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,760
served

414
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,860
um either because uh they're at capacity

415
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,540
on that that section it may not be

416
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,339
profitable for them to expand or upgrade

417
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,500
that uh and it's the type of thing where

418
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,199
it requires some actual pushback on you

419
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,139
know uh the county almost this was in

420
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,880
one of the sets of addresses they tried

421
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,620
to award me is they said well we need

422
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,060
you to serve this half of this trailer

423
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,519
park and I went back to them I said this

424
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,199
doesn't make sense like I'm happy to

425
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,300
build something that makes sense

426
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,620
um you know I'm happy to take your money

427
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,440
but you know this this doesn't make good

428
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,360
public policy to spend money when

429
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,740
there's already this existing

430
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,600
infrastructure there in place

431
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
uh and such and so you know we went back

432
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,740
and forth on a few things and uh

433
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,240
eventually they took this off of my list

434
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,820
and put this onto uh you know either

435
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,620
Comcast list to fix

436
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,480
um and removed it from contention or or

437
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,920
something else happened I'm not sure

438
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,839
exactly what happened I just know that I

439
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,220
thankfully didn't have to build to this

440
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,779
location anymore

441
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,079
uh so if I could uh next slide and and

442
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,880
same thing here this is another this is

443
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,860
a different trailer park

444
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,940
um and

445
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,040
that one building there you can see is a

446
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,500
level three Pop there's literally fiber

447
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,880
outside

448
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,800
you know these locations

449
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,019
um and there's also uh you know uh cable

450
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,699
TV available in that neighborhood as

451
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:24,660
well

452
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,519
um and so you know when you have this

453
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,500
data collection effort it's really easy

454
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,060
to get it wrong unless you actually go

455
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,519
out and do a physical field survey and

456
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,079
because they did they did go out and do

457
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,720
the field survey but they then used a

458
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,639
different company who had their own data

459
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,980
set that wasn't as accurate when they

460
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,259
issued the RFP they had to go and do us

461
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,060
they had to go and do a couple revisions

462
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,560
on that

463
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,079
um just because of the way the uh you

464
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,160
know the county

465
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,899
um you know bidding process goes for

466
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,339
awarding things

467
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,160
um and yeah it's you know you have these

468
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,680
these properties but it's uh you know

469
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,839
nobody nobody was even meeting the uh

470
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,040
the I think it's still the current

471
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,459
metric and the US is 20 25 down three up

472
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,679
um is to find this broadband

473
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,359
um and stuff it's you know and it's just

474
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,799
comical to see something like this where

475
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,599
it's literally literally the fiber regen

476
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,400
is outside of the place that doesn't

477
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,619
have internet access

478
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,959
um so if you have next slide

479
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,880
so in the U.S

480
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,980
um there was this uh stuff that happened

481
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,740
the uh Recovery Act funds

482
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,540
um what this did was actually very

483
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,120
interesting it basically sent money down

484
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,580
to all of the levels of government both

485
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,660
state

486
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,640
um you know look you know uh county-wide

487
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,440
as well as local governments and

488
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,660
basically said here's some money we know

489
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,620
covid is going to impact you uh and you

490
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,940
know you can go and spend it on a number

491
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,380
of different things you can spend it on

492
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,760
you know shovel ready infrastructure

493
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,620
projects from you know water system

494
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,840
repairs sewer system repairs Broadband

495
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,660
Broadband projects or if you don't have

496
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,640
any of those ready and if you can show

497
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,860
that you lost money they could go and do

498
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,360
there's a formula they could go and

499
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,580
calculate to determine uh you know

500
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,900
whether or not they could turn it into

501
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,400
unrestricted funds they could spend it

502
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,260
on whatever they wanted

503
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,940
um my County chose

504
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,039
um because they've done this study and

505
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,260
uh you know they they received about I

506
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,200
think 88 million dollars or so of uh of

507
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,179
this money locally they chose to take a

508
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,740
portion of that and alcohol take that to

509
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,320
the Broadband task force that had been

510
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,820
running for a while

511
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,059
um and then they did the the RFI and RFP

512
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,299
um that I ended up bidding on and so um

513
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,220
you know as part of this they actually

514
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,780
went they took some other things where

515
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,240
people had gotten money under

516
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,240
um CAF 2 and other programs where people

517
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,500
were going to be funded to build out

518
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,840
fixed Wireless uh and they said you know

519
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,580
what fix wireless we're going to declare

520
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,260
that out of scope and really the only

521
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,059
thing we you know we want to make sure

522
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,280
everyone has access to

523
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,860
um basically really high speed be it

524
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,580
fiber or um you know coaxial like uh you

525
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,559
know stuff over coax

526
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,440
um you know and they're basically

527
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,419
eliminating a lot of the DSL based

528
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,700
Technologies cop the copper stuff and a

529
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,900
lot of the you know the fixed Wireless

530
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,360
stuff because you can get some very high

531
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,160
speeds in the fixed Wireless especially

532
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,960
if you have really good line of sight

533
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,000
with the 60 gigahertz

534
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,080
um you know there's a lot of stuff in

535
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,539
the 60 to basically about 70 gigahertz

536
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,780
band that's unlicensed to the U.S

537
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,640
but we have these things in Michigan

538
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,520
called trees and those really just block

539
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,100
the RF propagation

540
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,080
um so yeah yeah this ended up being

541
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,419
great and uh they ended up funding it I

542
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:34,740
actually sat on the meeting I didn't

543
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,360
even understand when they approved it

544
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,059
because of the Obscure way in which the

545
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,320
government actually runs to approve

546
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,580
these things

547
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,260
um you know when I said on the the call

548
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,120
with the County Commissioners voting on

549
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,020
it

550
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,220
um so we've got next slide

551
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,780
um so you know at the beginning of this

552
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,940
year I you know I basically had about 13

553
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,760
kilometers of fiber Network end to end

554
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,039
um you know I was getting you know in in

555
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,600
some of the sections up to 80 Market

556
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,880
penetration I have a couple stretches of

557
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,679
road where I've actually hit and hit for

558
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,660
like a half mile section uh where I'm

559
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,400
actually uh hitting 100 Market

560
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,020
penetration every single home is

561
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,360
subscribing uh which is kind of amazing

562
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,419
uh because it's it's quite common for

563
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,820
you know about uh three to five percent

564
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,700
of homes just to be unoccupied uh you

565
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,620
know just because people are either you

566
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,980
know not at home or vacation or or um

567
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,780
you know or they're somewhere else

568
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,220
taking care of family or somebody has

569
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,080
passed away and it's still in the you

570
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,400
know it's still controlled by the family

571
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,440
or the estate and just nobody's looking

572
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,580
there

573
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,760
um so very up next slide please

574
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,299
I had uh you know you've got about four

575
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,380
more minutes

576
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,360
okay sounds good

577
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,340
um yeah so so earlier I had you know 65

578
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,780
customers online

579
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,600
um next next slide I think this should

580
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,220
be show that I have like 81 now

581
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,780
unfortunately I couldn't get it to

582
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,520
screenshot in the same overview map but

583
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,860
you know my network is further expanding

584
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,179
out

585
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,580
um you know I've only lost one customer

586
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,919
um because they didn't pay uh so this is

587
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,440
so the system eventually turned them off

588
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,179
um and stuff like that and now I'm now I

589
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,559
went from Hep you know I should have had

590
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,059
this Perpetual install queue of about

591
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,280
five to ten people now I've got about 35

592
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,140
people there waiting to be installed and

593
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,640
actually today I have two different

594
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,440
contractors in the US working for me

595
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,960
doing uh building in two different areas

596
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,840
at the same time uh so I'm gonna have to

597
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,059
have someone go by and drive and check

598
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,500
them check out that they're actually out

599
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,580
there working

600
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,679
um but you know uh I'll probably end up

601
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,179
end this week with another somewhere

602
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:34,679
between half mile and mile of network

603
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,659
build uh that I'm gonna have to go home

604
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,179
and uh make sure it gets lit up uh from

605
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,120
here seven next slide

606
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,640
I think this so a lot of people are are

607
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,200
interested in this because I'm a small

608
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,960
company I have no problem revealing data

609
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,059
uh you know about a lot of things this

610
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,520
is kind of what my uh Network usage

611
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,159
looks like uh you know overall I do have

612
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,720
um the wireless ISP I used to buy

613
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,640
internet access from I sell him

614
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,280
wholesale internet access now at a at a

615
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,720
reasonable rate

616
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,280
um and stuff so you know there's

617
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,679
probably about 150 users or so behind

618
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,820
this

619
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,200
um I also don't uh you know hopefully no

620
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,520
none of my subscribers are going to

621
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,840
watch this I actually don't rate shape

622
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,400
any of them either

623
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,039
um so the slowest piece of network

624
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,720
equipment is in their house which is

625
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,940
usually their wireless connection or the

626
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,000
gigabit connection to uh their router

627
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,980
um you know from that perspective uh and

628
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,600
stuff and so you can see last November

629
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,580
when I got you know the you know a hump

630
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,159
of people online and aside from the data

631
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,900
collection issues you know obviously I'm

632
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,360
continuing to continuing to add uh you

633
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,280
know more Network usage over time uh

634
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,140
next slide

635
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,140
so I'm you know I'm using a bunch of the

636
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,360
ubiquity Pond Hardware today I'm looking

637
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,640
to to move to the Nokia stuff because

638
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,860
that is uh you know you know a little

639
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,940
bit better

640
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,039
um and then you know I've done what what

641
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,700
all smart uh nerds uh do that uh are in

642
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,340
my position I have amazing DHCP servers

643
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,140
like my Raspberry Pi

644
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,360
um you know that works really well uh

645
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,039
you know for doing stuff it just needs

646
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,320
to sit up on the network be low power

647
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,760
um and stuff but I also have a little

648
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,799
you know like Intel Intel box doing

649
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,299
stuff and so if either one of them are

650
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,860
down actually I noticed earlier today

651
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,380
that the dtp service wasn't running on

652
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,000
one of them and everything was still

653
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,380
fine

654
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,820
um you know because it's running in

655
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,260
redundant fashion and sending all the

656
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,620
DHCP requests to both of them uh yeah

657
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,939
I've kind of next slide please

658
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,900
um yeah so 2022 like I said I'm still

659
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,340
doing construction now

660
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,900
um it's really tricky to do a lot of

661
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,179
this because you know the ROI cycle on a

662
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,500
lot of these projects is actually more

663
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,440
than is really more than 10 years

664
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,020
um you know this why it requires uh you

665
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,059
know some sort of either a subsidy or a

666
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,980
grant process to go and get to some of

667
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,360
these locations

668
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,220
um there's I think at least three home

669
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,780
three or four homes that I've built too

670
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,120
where they're the only home in like a

671
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,140
half mile

672
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,760
so you basically are going about you

673
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,080
know half a mile

674
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,419
um you know down the road to hit one

675
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,520
house or one resident

676
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,220
um and you know uh it's interesting

677
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,480
because one of the ones that my

678
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,740
contractor is going to be building to in

679
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,480
this next week we're going half mile

680
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,159
down this road I've already talked to

681
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,080
the subscriber or to the person they

682
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,820
don't want the service

683
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,080
um but it's going to be available there

684
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,440
in the future so if you know uh you know

685
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,240
the the County's goal is we want it to

686
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,340
be available every parcel

687
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,220
um for a standard install fee uh and so

688
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,260
we're building the infrastructure uh to

689
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,120
be able to do that

690
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,700
um you know and uh you know a lot of

691
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,080
that Federal you know a lot of the

692
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,120
Recovery Act money is still in local

693
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,100
government's hands although um of the

694
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,780
people who want in my County I'm the

695
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,700
only one who's building right now

696
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,840
um there were four different there were

697
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,820
four companies that one in in Washington

698
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,200
County and I'm the only one who's

699
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,260
actually built using uh you know the uh

700
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,000
the contract award funds so I'm the only

701
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,740
one who's gotten paid out some of that

702
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,419
this year uh next slide

703
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,620
um this kind of shows you can kind of

704
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,020
see uh on this map that that green

705
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,640
portion on the top is what I built first

706
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,980
the you know the green kind of going

707
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,059
south

708
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,159
like the South and West portion here is

709
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,960
the second and then the stuff that's off

710
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,520
on the the right is the stuff that's

711
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,159
been built you know with uh the arpa

712
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,100
grant money uh that I received and you

713
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,080
know this also shows all the areas I do

714
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,240
have to continue to build to

715
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,159
um and because I started early on a lot

716
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,440
of this I actually have the permits for

717
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,260
most of these areas already so the only

718
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,179
thing that's uh really blocking me is

719
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,400
the weather and uh you know just

720
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,740
construction crew availability so I'm

721
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,480
out I'm out building a lot of this right

722
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,620
now

723
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,299
um you know and they're gonna they're

724
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,500
gonna be getting down there's a

725
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,880
populated area down here around this

726
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,440
Lake that got added in at the last

727
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,880
minute

728
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,500
um you know which is going to be very

729
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,880
nice to get service too we'll probably

730
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,740
get that to them you know

731
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,960
January February time frame based on

732
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,179
what's going on now but you know not a

733
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,720
lot of fun uh so uh next slide yep thank

734
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,700
you um yeah so the future I'm gonna I'm

735
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,440
gonna complete the project people keep

736
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,360
calling me and asking me to build more

737
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,299
stuff uh you know and you know just

738
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,240
because I happen to uh have a few skills

739
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,220
when it comes to the pr portion of my

740
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,360
life

741
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,740
um and stuff like that I'm going

742
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,600
head-to-head with you know some of the

743
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,640
existing incumbents in the area

744
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,380
um but there's also a lot of mergers and

745
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,179
Acquisitions in in the space people

746
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,500
rolling up a lot of the smaller

747
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,700
providers

748
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,200
um to do that and I'm expecting because

749
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,659
I'm building in areas that

750
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,600
um are funded through um the ardoff uh

751
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,460
ardoff II Grant I'm expecting the

752
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,860
provider uh who owns some of the areas

753
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,900
where I have to build past them to get

754
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,600
to the other addresses I'm expecting

755
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,820
them to come to me uh you know when they

756
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,100
come to build into the area because uh

757
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,720
you know I already have fiber Assets in

758
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,460
the area it probably doesn't make sense

759
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,400
for them to uh to build it if I if I

760
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,600
already have it there because these

761
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,179
areas are are not very populated

762
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,860
um and then yeah I have this continuous

763
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,059
problem I always call the next house

764
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,559
problem which is once you get fiber to

765
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,539
somebody the next house hears about it

766
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,100
and they always want it

767
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,120
um and so you kind of have this

768
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,299
continual you know outgrowing Circle

769
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,299
which gets larger and larger so uh next

770
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,260
slide

771
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,240
I think it's just about that time Jared

772
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,860
okay

773
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,200
all right we have about five minutes of

774
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,419
for great questions for Jared Jared that

775
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,340
was awesome thank you

776
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,120
okay folks um let's get back to I need

777
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,039
to get back to my participant View

778
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,039
and I believe Christina Dino's in the

779
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,559
canadino you're up trying and folks can

780
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,960
speak quickly get less than a minute for

781
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,419
a question so that uh your question so

782
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,179
Jared can answer the question

783
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,220
okay um so I I think you answered the

784
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,380
question from your uh equipment slide

785
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,779
but are you actually

786
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,940
your dmarc of the services at the curb

787
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,100
or at the house or inside the house it's

788
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,320
it it's on the it's somewhere around the

789
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,419
outside of the house so we run a CAT5

790
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,700
cable out uh we put the equipment on the

791
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,799
outside of the house and then um there's

792
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,260
a little Poe brick on the inside and

793
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,179
then do you provide that equipment and

794
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,980
maintain it for the customer they do it

795
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,080
themselves uh the stuff on the outside I

796
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,700
provide maintain that because that's

797
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,460
tied with the uh the pond system and

798
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,700
then um inside I offer uh

799
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,100
I sell at Cost wireless routers to

800
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,140
people so I'll go and offer them either

801
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,020
uh I have some microchick routers that I

802
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,880
give out as loaners

803
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,320
um and then if they don't return like

804
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,240
basically anything that I Supply to them

805
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,360
if they don't return in 30 days uh I

806
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,039
just add it to their bill at whatever my

807
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,380
cost was I don't Mark that up and do you

808
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,539
configure it and maintain it for them I

809
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,820
I do the initial configuration for them

810
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,860
and I I assume they call you and it

811
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,900
doesn't work uh yes because they have

812
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,360
nobody else to call I guess right I I am

813
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,700
their ISP they call me okay second

814
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,559
question is have you considered offering

815
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,440
Wi-Fi services to houses that

816
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,260
um can get them to your fiber area

817
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,919
uh you mean me selling like a

818
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,179
point-to-point wireless link to somebody

819
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,860
to bring them onto my yeah like put a

820
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,200
Wi-Fi AP that doesn't make sense or just

821
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,539
no no I do so so I have a couple

822
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:13,980
customers who have barns on their

823
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,260
property that have animals in them uh

824
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,039
and so what I do is I offer a um

825
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,620
I I allow them a choice between two

826
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,740
options we can do uh extend their

827
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,299
network from their home out to the barn

828
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:31,799
in a kind of on a Cost Plus basis or

829
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,779
I say I'll charge you a standard install

830
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,580
for the second building and only charge

831
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,799
you ten dollars more a month

832
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,419
um you know for the service and then

833
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,779
just to basically do to do two installs

834
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,940
bring them back they're on two different

835
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,760
onus on my side it's not one it's not

836
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,679
one network from their side you know if

837
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,820
they want to run if they want to run

838
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,440
their own campus

839
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,299
Network between all their barns or

840
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,220
whatever that's up to them uh you know

841
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,779
and a lot of the farmers you know

842
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,880
they're familiar with digging up all of

843
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,500
you know all their stuff but but I

844
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,299
actually literally have fiber to the cow

845
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,460
in some of these locations where it goes

846
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,659
out to the cow barn and they have

847
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,220
cameras in there so they can watch them

848
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,159
uh Cav um in about

849
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,740
you know two a month and a half or two

850
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,419
months or so where they start calving in

851
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,039
the middle of winter and one last quick

852
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,779
question have you considered satellite

853
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,600
access for either yourself to support

854
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,820
them or for the customers

855
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,159
I I have not although I'm a happy

856
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,799
starlink customer in my uh in my

857
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,220
vacation home oh okay okay and is there

858
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,059
any multi-home requests or no no no

859
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:37,860
all right we are at time Jared this was

860

fabulous and

861
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,799
um for those that think putting a

862
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,419
network in the United States is easy it

863
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,740
is not Jared thank you for what you're

864
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,659
doing I would we'd love to talk to you

865
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,880
more about this uh so we may call you

866
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,840
back

867
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,480
um uh if there are other questions

868
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,720
um alrighty we now have um Tim genders

869
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,360
up Tim I'm going to pull your slides up

870
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,620
and uh give me a sec to do that but

871
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,059
could you introduce yourself to the

872
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,179
group and you'll have 20 minutes

873
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,159
thank you very much Jane my name is Tim

874
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,360
genders

875
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,460
um I'm the commercial director for

876
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,039
project seizeway

877
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,820
um as projects at seizeway we're a

878
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,399
not-for-profit in in South Africa

879
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,260
um we've been operating for about nine

880
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,799
years and we've been our our aim is to

881
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,039
get connectivity out to the unconnected

882
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,580
in South Africa and really use that as a

883
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,899
model

884
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:33,480
um for the rest of Africa

885
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,059
great

886
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,860
thanks Jane

887
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,380
um I can see the slide is upside I'm

888
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,340
entitled The Talk and uncapping Africa

889
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,260
and the reason

890
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,659
um why is because what we see is that

891
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,840
that Africa is is reasonably connected

892
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,480
not great but reasonably connected with

893
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,880
mobile data

894
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,220
um the problem with that which we'll go

895
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,760
into is that it's it's not uncapped it's

896
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,120
not Wi-Fi it's it's got a per gig basis

897
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,340
and when and when data is being used

898
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,820
frugally the the real impact of the

899
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,919
internet is not Unleashed and that not

900
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,620
uncapped so so our goal is to really

901
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,559
open up the the real benefit of the

902
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,460
internet

903
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,120
um for everybody

904
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,440
um yeah if we can move on to the next

905
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
slide

906
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,760
just really to highlight the problem

907
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,580
that we're solving in in South Africa

908
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,460
it's um fortunately one of the most

909
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,000
unequal countries in the world

910
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,600
um we have 20 of the population brings

911
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,240
in about seven uh has about 70 of the

912
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,779
income and that the bottom 40 only seven

913
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,700
percent of the income so we've got this

914
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,539
this crazy disparity between the rich

915
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,880
and the poor or the high income and the

916
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,940
low income and and that is a real

917
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,399
problem and and actually South Africa

918
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,140
has a phrase of being a world in one

919
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,520
country and it's a really interesting

920
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,919
microcosm of the world and the challenge

921
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,679
of the world of of this disparate you

922
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,360
know inequity

923
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,940
um that we see in the World At Large

924
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,820
thanks Jane if we can move to the to the

925
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,019
next slide

926
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,640
so

927
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,640
what we what we have and what we've had

928
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,720
in in the last couple of years is is a

929
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,480
rising unemployment rate

930
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,380
um rising up to 34 35

931
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,620
of of the population what is even more

932
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,380
distressing is that

933
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,100
um

934
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,419
in the youth uh 15 to 24 year old

935
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,580
um people coming out of school

936
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,940
that rate is at 65 that means only one

937
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,559
in three people

938
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,640
um get to enjoy a job now what we have

939
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,980
in South Africa is a situation where

940
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,000
only only 10 of the homes in South

941
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,720
Africa have got uh fixed Broadband I

942
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,339
like to say I've got Wi-Fi because it's

943
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:09,960
the easiest way to get the message

944
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,080
across is if I say only 10 of the home's

945
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,820
got Wi-Fi it just seems to come across

946
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,159
better than saying only 10 have got

947
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,399
fixed Broadband so so as you can imagine

948
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,739
for the Youth that are unemployed and

949
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,080
getting a get having access to the

950
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,239
internet is really critical for getting

951
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,580
a job that's a real challenge for them

952
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,800
and it's it's is this challenge that

953
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,560
we're we're up to address and to try and

954
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,599
solve and to try and create models of

955
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,879
how to how to deal with this problem

956
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,060
so if we can go to the next slide please

957
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,219
Jane this

958
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,440
um is a picture of South Africa it's

959
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,599
actually up on the internet that really

960
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,780
highlights this inequality problem where

961
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,399
you've got this Main Street that's in

962
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,139
Johannesburg somewhere and I need to

963
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,780
work out exactly where it is where

964
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,339
you've got this Main Street and you've

965
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:00,780
got what we call on the left-hand side

966
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,780
the leafy suburbs and on the right hand

967
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,720
side you've got the townships or this

968
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,859
high density more low-income areas so

969
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,079
the right hand side is 90 of South

970
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,540
Africa the left-hand side is 10 of South

971
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,300
Africa the left-hand side gets to enjoy

972
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,180
data of Wi-Fi costs that I've taken a

973
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,180
guess based on you know how much data a

974
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,660
home consumes and it's roughly around 15

975
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,900
cents a gigabyte of data that they pay

976
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,740
the the right hand side because they're

977
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,780
buying in small

978
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,839
um data bundles generally around 10 Rand

979
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,339
to 20 Rand

980
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,820
their cost of data per gigabyte is

981
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,320
around 15 okay so on top of this

982
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,359
inequality we've got this data

983
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,660
inequality that says that if you are

984
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,500
rich you get to pay for data at 15 cents

985
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,560
a gig if you're a poor you you have to

986
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,579
pay 15 which means you know a meeting

987
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,339
like this would have cost me 15 and

988
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,380
that's expensive it's really really

989
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,839
expensive to be poor

990
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,480
um and it's it's it's that

991
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,540
um in inequality that we're out to fix

992
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,980
in fact

993
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,900
Jared I thoroughly enjoyed your

994
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,060
presentation and I actually want to get

995
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,000
across and I've noted down the problems

996
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,180
that you highlighted and I'm going to

997
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,660
say in Africa we have exactly the same

998
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,859
problems but we have them at a different

999
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:39,420
percentage so you would you're

1000
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,640
addressing the problem of a percentage

1001
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,980
of the population not having fixed

1002
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,660
Broadband or not having access to the

1003
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,060
internet at an equitable rate

1004
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,520
in America I'm not sure what the

1005
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,500
percentage is let's let's say it's maybe

1006
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,339
around 10 in South Africa it's 90

1007
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,900
exactly the same problem just a

1008
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,400
different percentage of the population

1009
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,760
that we're trying to deal with again we

1010
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,800
also have the same problem of maps and

1011
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,599
lack of fidelity of maps I thought it

1012
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,160
was just an African problem it was

1013
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,900
actually interesting to hear that you

1014
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,940
have the same problem in the States but

1015
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,220
just that access to information is is a

1016
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,280
is a real challenge for us and again we

1017
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,020
have exactly the same problem as you

1018
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,180
where we've got fiber actually passing

1019
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,339
these areas so as you can imagine that

1020
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,020
area on the left-hand side that's got

1021
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,220
fiber

1022
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,380
the area on the right hand side doesn't

1023
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,540
have fiber and yet they're paying these

1024
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,780
100 times more data costs and and that's

1025
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,180
what we're out to fix

1026
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,520
um we also I didn't know we also have

1027
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,720
trees in South Africa and so the trees

1028
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,540
give us a problem for the RF

1029
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,880
um and finally also exactly the same

1030
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,280
problem of getting of the return on

1031
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,260
investment numbers being seven to ten

1032
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,140
years and and without subsidies it's

1033
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,880
it's a challenge to get the networks

1034
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,380
deployed

1035
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,619
um I think what we've got is a real need

1036
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:04,680
and a real urgency to get these networks

1037
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,660
deployed in in Africa as a whole because

1038
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,380
of the inequality that if you have a

1039
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,240
portion of the world's population able

1040
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,220
to enjoy the internet able to get

1041
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,099
educated at the touch of a button able

1042
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,980
to get a job or apply for a job easily

1043
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,720
able to develop their own local

1044
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,820
economies easily

1045
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,520
um and have all of that that

1046
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,619
um speed of efficiency that the internet

1047
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,619
brings to Economic Development if you've

1048
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,960
got you know a portion of the world that

1049
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,599
doesn't have that it is going to create

1050
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,380
a a further inequality into the Next

1051
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,099
Generation we we actually have a fairly

1052
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,619
controversial phrase for this and it's

1053
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,800
it we call it digital apartheid

1054
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,960
um and and it's really that that we're

1055
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,280
out to

1056
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,820
um to solve and crack and and get just a

1057
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,760
fair internet request access in Africa

1058
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,140
happening

1059
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,240
thanks Jane if you can move to the next

1060
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,920
slide so our solution to that is to take

1061
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,619
um oh we I I did put another of your

1062
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,480
problems there Jared with non-payment

1063
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,200
okay so what and and that is is a big

1064
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,119
problem with those

1065
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,740
um if you like uncredit worthy homes

1066
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,079
that you saw on the right hand side

1067
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,839
so what we've done is we've said right

1068
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,920
let's go for hey as you go uh and we

1069
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,079
took your average

1070
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,400
um

1071
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,880
access of a home and we sliced it into

1072
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,579
30 days we sliced it into four devices

1073
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,280
per home and we said let's to get an

1074
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,260
equitable access let's go for five Rand

1075
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,740
or 30 cents per day uncapped internet

1076
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,220
access and do it on a pay-as-you-go

1077
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,440
model as well in some of our networks

1078
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,900
I'll go through some of the the journey

1079
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,820
that we've gone through as as project is

1080
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,460
easy way but we found by doing it on pay

1081
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,500
as you go we we took out all of those

1082
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,660
hassles with collecting debts if they

1083
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,859
haven't got the money they don't come on

1084
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,359
if they have they do come on for the day

1085
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,920
and

1086
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,380
um away they go and then tomorrow they

1087
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,119
may not have the money but the following

1088
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,060
day they do and so it really does pay as

1089
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,339
you go really does address

1090
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,560
um that the debt collecting aspect for

1091
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,900
us right let's hit the next slide yep so

1092
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,119
what we've gone for as well actually

1093
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,240
very similar to in what we saw with the

1094
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,280
previous with Jared's presentation is

1095
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,900
communities connecting themselves up

1096
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,880
spotting the problem within their own

1097
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,160
area saying we need connectivity here

1098
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,500
and and what we're after is Project to

1099
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,520
Caesar is to to create a model whereby

1100
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,220
we can have local communities in Africa

1101
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,500
just follow our methodology follow up

1102
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,359
use our systems

1103
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:57,480
um get Wi-Fi out on a Pairs and the pay

1104
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,640
as you go unkept basis to their own

1105
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,900
communities

1106
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,839
and and involve those communities and

1107
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,579
get them running their own networks and

1108
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,320
really that's that's the drive of what

1109
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,599
we're trying to do as projects to

1110
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,160
seizeway

1111
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,680
um and we've done that through getting

1112
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,839
to this point through quite a very

1113
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,480
interesting history of of where we've

1114
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,000
tried different different mechanisms and

1115
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,560
models and I'm just going to take you

1116
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,320
through a few of our case studies of of

1117
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,480
where we've gone in our in our history

1118
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,540
so if we can move to the the next slide

1119
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,900
please because this was our big project

1120
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,220
um This was

1121
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,440
um the schwannee municipality or

1122
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,200
Pretoria and the surrounding suburbs

1123
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,740
um this was funded by the municipality

1124
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,480
um we

1125
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,400
developed this network over about five

1126
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,420
years

1127
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,000
um at the and it's at its Pinnacle we

1128
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,200
had 600 000 users a month coming on we

1129
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,900
were like a radio station in terms of

1130
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,359
being able to reach people it had

1131
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,940
fantastic power in that the mayor was

1132
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,680
able to give speeches out to the people

1133
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,859
it was going really really well right up

1134
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,420
until the day

1135
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,540
um the elections happened and um due to

1136
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,180
other reasons not the Wi-Fi that

1137
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,460
political party got voted out and a

1138
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,160
different political party came in and

1139
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,260
and they came in with the approach of

1140
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,380
you know a new room what um brushes

1141
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,140
clean they decided not to carry on with

1142
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,839
this with this network which was really

1143
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,540
really sad and really disappointing

1144
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,420
um they and and so the network has has

1145
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,660
petered off into a state of of

1146
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,060
um lack of support from what I can

1147
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,280
gather we handed that network over to

1148
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,240
them in 27 team and and sadly

1149
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,119
um Municipal funding we found doesn't

1150
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,280
really work because of the volatility of

1151
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,380
the politics and different people coming

1152
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,079
in and you just need much longer term

1153
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,960
projects going on with municipalities I

1154
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,140
went to link NYC and visited them when

1155
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,240
this was in its Heyday we actually had

1156
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,720
more customers than link NYC in this day

1157
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,300
um and but sadly they had a 15-year

1158
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,720
contract we had a five-year contract and

1159
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,640
as a result you know they're still going

1160
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,940
very successfully and uh you know we've

1161
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,160
moved on to other things as project is

1162
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,260
sees with it so that was where we

1163
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,020
learned the power of the internet and

1164
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,640
the power of what it can do and the

1165
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,200
stories that we came out of there of how

1166
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,960
people got jobs educated themselves all

1167
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,000
of that was just wonderful and it's off

1168
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,300
this story that we we live and we we

1169
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,040
know that what we're doing is so

1170
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,960
meaningful and so important

1171
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,119
right let's move on to what we did after

1172
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,060
shwani we then worked uh we then turned

1173
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,920
our attention to corporate and these

1174
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,079
projects I can thankfully report are

1175
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,579
still going

1176
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,500
um we do a lot of work with mining

1177
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,720
companies with glencore

1178
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,540
um and we've got quite a few

1179
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,880
um communities connected up and and

1180
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,359
we're saving them millions a month in

1181
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,220
terms of being able to give them free

1182
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,839
Wi-Fi

1183
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,119
um into their communities now glencore

1184
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,520
have an approach that they want to fund

1185
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,740
the Wi-Fi into the community they don't

1186
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,900
want a sustainability model they want

1187
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,079
they took a view and said we're in for

1188
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,000
this for the Long Haul we'll keep

1189
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,700
funding these um young people their

1190
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,220
Wi-Fi in the interests of uplifting and

1191
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,780
building their communities and those

1192
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,540
networks are going strong and delivering

1193
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,240
Beautiful Stories and savings every

1194
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,579
month to the people around them and that

1195
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:42,060
that area is more uh to the Johannesburg

1196
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,060
and to the to the Eastern sort of coal

1197
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,099
mining areas of Johannesburg that we're

1198
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:50,280
working with Glencoe

1199
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,760
um the next slide please then um the

1200
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,760
other growing businesses in South Africa

1201
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,700
are independent power plants

1202
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,920
um we're working with one of those in um

1203
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,900
the northern Cape which is a very

1204
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,720
sparsely populated area

1205
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,000
um and what we found here is that there

1206
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,520
was improvements in the education excuse

1207
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,400
my formatting there in the education

1208
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,579
they've got access to jobs through the

1209
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:20,040
internet and what they also found which

1210
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,660
was really great was there was a

1211
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,560
reduction in in petty crime often in

1212
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,660
bringing out internet corporates when

1213
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,520
we're asking for sponsorships or grants

1214
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,660
to say to them you know what are they

1215
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,859
going to use it for are they going to

1216
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:33,480
educate themselves are they just going

1217
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,540
to watch Netflix and I say to them well

1218
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,240
you know actually what we see is if you

1219
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,280
get a whole Community watching Netflix

1220
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,720
it reduces the crime it's a bit like

1221
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,940
um TV in the old days

1222
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,880
um so there's such benefits just by you

1223
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,940
know what we would see as the you know

1224
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,280
just yeah the entertainment side of the

1225
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,440
internet actually has significant

1226
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,480
benefits in terms of reducing crime

1227
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,760
we're also working with a very

1228
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,460
interesting fairly large

1229
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,380
um alcohol supplier in terms of getting

1230
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,020
into into their taverns

1231
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,619
um and and really bringing about some

1232
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:17,420
um interesting assistance in terms of

1233
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,640
mental health and helping them Reach

1234
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,800
people through their taverns and

1235
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,660
addressing well you know why are you

1236
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,240
here drinking effectively and you know

1237
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,220
and and helping to address mental health

1238
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,200
problems with that that's a project

1239
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,819
that's just starting off which we're

1240
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,740
really really excited about what

1241
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,660
connectivity can bring in terms of just

1242
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,420
helping people you know get a handle of

1243
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,160
their lives and get to a better place

1244
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,319
especially after covid with the amount

1245
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,680
of mental health issues there are all

1246
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,079
right let's move to the next slide so

1247
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:51,780
just to give you a quick background we

1248
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,780
did have our networks on um Facebook's

1249
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,660
Express Wi-Fi they sadly sunseted it

1250
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,220
this year but

1251
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,940
um we have uh I need to give a very big

1252
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,000
plug to splinks which are a check

1253
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,740
company

1254
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,859
um they stepped in and did a fantastic

1255
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:14,099
job in replacing Express Wi-Fi so we

1256
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:16,980
we're now fully working on Springs a lot

1257
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,900
of our equipment is

1258
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,900
um using cambium uh CM Maestro acts as a

1259
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,160
really great

1260
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,579
um OSS for us and just to show you

1261
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:29,099
that's marandani she looks after our our

1262
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,540
knock

1263
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,339
um so we're quite a small team but she

1264
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:33,900
looks after 45

1265
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,140
000 a month active customers you can see

1266
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,040
um yeah so um we we renew a customer

1267
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,020
every month we don't go back longer than

1268
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,420
a month on the pay as you go Murray

1269
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,480
looks after as a single looks out of

1270
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,700
forty five thousand customers I think

1271
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,380
she looks after more customers than an

1272
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,140
individual with anyone else I know

1273
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,060
um but that's just the power of the tech

1274
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,640
solution that we've got behind behind

1275
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,960
this

1276
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,300
okay then the next slide please Jane

1277
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,180
yeah so this is this is one of the key

1278
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,900
problems that we we had is where we we

1279
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,020
wanted to move to a sustainable model

1280
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,819
um where instead of giving Wi-Fi for

1281
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,579
free let's get to this as I said the

1282
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:20,280
five Rand a day model

1283
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,500
and one of the biggest challenges you

1284
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,300
have with that is you've got the five

1285
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,359
Rand or the 10 Rand in your hand you've

1286
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,359
got the device in your hand you've got

1287
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:33,540
the Wi-Fi waves washing over you but how

1288
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,060
do you get five Rand into the phone so

1289
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,400
that you can get your Wi-Fi and and

1290
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,500
dealing with that is probably almost a

1291
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,940
bigger problem than rolling out a

1292
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,500
network

1293
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,480
um and we've been working with a company

1294
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,520
called Villa coin they've got a

1295
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,760
blockchain wallet which allows anyone to

1296
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,859
buy and sell and anyone to sell on the

1297
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:55,859
Wi-Fi and that's really opened up a lot

1298
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:59,700
of the the revenue growth for us by

1299
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,400
using this online

1300
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,800
um blockchain wallet and it's been

1301
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,319
really interesting to see how that is

1302
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,180
being adopted within the communities

1303
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:13,020
where we're deploying our Networks

1304
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,660
right let's go on to the next slide

1305
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,839
please yeah so in terms of then the last

1306
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:21,060
two case studies I'd like to show you

1307
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,619
we've got one network down in umeni

1308
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:27,060
um which is

1309
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,500
a lovely rural community in

1310
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,859
um close to Peter maritzburg in

1311
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:37,680
kwazulu-natal

1312
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,480
um it's probably around seven or eight

1313
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,579
thousand homes

1314
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,880
um we've just put down about 20 Wi-Fi

1315
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,859
access points at this stage we're

1316
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,560
working with sponsorship from

1317
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,160
um a lovely Dutch company called 48

1318
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,599
um dot org they are active a couple of

1319
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,760
Dutch come one is called voice

1320
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,940
um and they donate a percentage of their

1321
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,859
profits and this is one of the projects

1322
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:07,220
that we're we've been doing with them

1323
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,920
now and purple Mania has really produced

1324
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,319
some beautiful stories about how

1325
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:16,440
connectivity allows the community to

1326
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,040
then innovate and create Local Economic

1327
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,780
growth

1328
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,940
um so for example that picture up on the

1329
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,940
top there is is there was an issue where

1330
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,099
you know the people wanted seats to be

1331
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:30,180
able to

1332
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:30,839
um

1333
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:34,440
use the Wi-Fi and and and sit on and

1334
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,180
there they were just doing some training

1335
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,280
sessions in how you use how you put

1336
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,339
plastic bottles and fill them with soil

1337
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:43,560
and then create seats out of plastic

1338
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,359
bottles which um I thought was

1339
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,220
absolutely wonderful

1340
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,319
um then using that and then they sit on

1341
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,240
that for their for their Wi-Fi which is

1342
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,920
beautiful

1343
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,220
um and then the lady there is Leafly and

1344
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,740
and she's developed an online cooking

1345
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,559
business within and papa Mandy and

1346
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,599
actually delivers

1347
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,640
um you know

1348
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,099
higher better nutritional vegetarian

1349
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:11,579
food into the into the local economy

1350
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:13,800
because she's very passionate about

1351
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,780
people eating well

1352
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,260
um and and often in these areas is the

1353
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,200
the quality of food and uh is is not is

1354
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,220
not great in in terms of um you know

1355
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,319
chips and you know meat and hamburgers

1356
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,359
you know really fast food type stuff

1357
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:32,940
whereas little has got this passion to

1358
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,700
cook well to do local produce to show

1359
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,160
people the nutritional value and and and

1360
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,660
she's gone for these what's called

1361
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,660
vegetarian courts and she's doing really

1362
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,420
well going online and as a result of her

1363
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,559
online

1364
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,280
um

1365
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,800
activity and and exposure of a business

1366
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,900
she actually got sponsored to go to

1367
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,119
Italy and and develop her cooking

1368
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,420
schools in in it in Italy which was just

1369
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,819
fantastic to see how the connectivity

1370
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:02,880
just you know made that trip available

1371
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,220
to her otherwise she you know she's

1372
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,920
doing things she never even dreamed of

1373
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,420
um before we brought the the

1374
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,819
connectivity in there so we just love

1375
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:14,640
the stories that are coming out of uh of

1376
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,500
many

1377
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,260
and then if I can move to our to our

1378
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,359
last slide which is which is La mampa

1379
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,040
which is where we sort of get to the

1380
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,040
maths and the numbers of of how we are

1381
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,559
how we are we going to make this

1382
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,119
sustainable because I think that's the

1383
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,339
question that a lot of people want

1384
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:34,140
answered within

1385
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,720
um within an African context if we can

1386
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,140
get pay as you go Wi-Fi out to

1387
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,839
communities either by fiber or

1388
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:45,119
wirelessly you know will we get enough

1389
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,660
money to to hit those um return on

1390
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,760
investment numbers that we we want to

1391
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,520
get and and what we've seen is that

1392
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,319
we've with

1393
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:57,780
um Lamont we've seen it growing I've

1394
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,400
just given you the revenues we're

1395
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,280
getting in about 23

1396
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,359
000

1397
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,760
um there what's what's nice is to see

1398
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,579
how that has grown from about thirteen

1399
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,680
thousand up to twenty three thousand

1400
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,480
over the last three months and I'm

1401
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,920
looking forward to that growing again

1402
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,160
and the month following is still as you

1403
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,380
can see is still a little bit erratic

1404
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:23,160
um but we're hoping this can can go in

1405
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,900
the right direction

1406
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,599
now Jane I don't know what it's like

1407
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,640
over over

1408
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,180
um

1409
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,460
over this medium whether whether that

1410
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,020
video

1411
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,000
um would work it's just about a two

1412
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,920
minute video two and a half minute video

1413
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,040
if you've got time uh that may be a

1414
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,980
little tricky um but what we can do is

1415
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,079
we can send a note out to the guy list

1416
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,500
and CCU and add the presentation and

1417
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,540
folks could watch it

1418
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,740
um and come back to you if you don't

1419
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,619
mind that way well it's there it gives

1420
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:57,720
you a little video overview of the

1421
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,960
lamontville network but um yeah I mean

1422
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,839
the month was where we're trying to

1423
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,720
develop now a business that we can spin

1424
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,700
off with investment so that they can

1425
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,640
stand on their own two feet and um you

1426
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,839
know that's that's where we're having

1427
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:15,480
discussions now is right now we've built

1428
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,920
this network we've got the young people

1429
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,960
trained they're able to connect their

1430
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,119
Community up we actually want to spin

1431
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,520
them off to fly by themselves and grow

1432
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,500
and and then really rinse and repeat

1433
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,339
that model elsewhere in Africa

1434
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:30,960
all right well thank you so much Tim

1435
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,760
we've got about

1436
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,180
um eight seven minutes for questions

1437
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,160
um let me start off by asking you are

1438
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,839
you training people to be digital

1439
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,180
Navigators and then Curtis has a

1440
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,579
question my digital Navigators I mean uh

1441
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:47,640
train the trainer model to show people

1442
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,380
um what the what the power of

1443
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,319
connectivity and content can do

1444
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,540
yes yes

1445
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:58,140
um so we've got a picture of nabisa

1446
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,280
there

1447
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,480
um she she she's one such person so in

1448
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,720
terms of them selling more Wi-Fi so

1449
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,000
we've opened up the Wi-Fi for anyone to

1450
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,280
sell and then we're training them in

1451
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,859
terms of how do they get more out of it

1452
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,500
what we're doing is focusing as well on

1453
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,140
educational content and really showing

1454
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,700
them you know we're working with

1455
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,500
Microsoft there in terms of showing them

1456
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,440
the online curriculum uh really really

1457
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,780
getting them connecting with their

1458
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,280
communities and you're absolutely right

1459
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,300
Jane

1460
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,640
you know they they get the internet and

1461
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,460
it's like they don't you know they they

1462
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,740
uh

1463
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,540
the sort of realization of what they can

1464
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,660
do with it needs to be opened up on on

1465
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:46,500
the other hand are we also find that in

1466
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,160
terms of from a tech side they are

1467
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,040
um we have to be very on our toes in

1468
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,400
terms of them trying to break the break

1469
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,220
the system and get into that for free

1470
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,140
um you know we have people that break

1471
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,780
the system and my first um my first

1472
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:08,160
reaction is can we employ them yeah

1473
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,619
it left at least they're hacking the

1474
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:14,339
network I mean there's some lessons

1475
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:15,720
learned there

1476
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,540
um so kudas is in the queue um Curtis uh

1477
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,180
over to you for your question for Tim

1478
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,040
yeah I was hoping my audio works it

1479
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,780
looks like it does

1480
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,720
um great yeah so uh uh great

1481
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,520
presentation and um I'm really

1482
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,880
interested about the use of a sort of

1483
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,520
entertainment uh that that the that

1484
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,780
piece of the talk

1485
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,819
um there's a whole bunch of work uh Tom

1486
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:41,460
Smythe is sort of the uh the the big one

1487
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,500
for me a long time ago showing the value

1488
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,119
of that kind of stuff but you were the

1489
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,460
first one to really discuss uh

1490
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,760
a relationship between sort of crime and

1491
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,380
entertainment services I was wondering

1492
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,079
is your your where that connection came

1493
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:56,520
from if there's any research as a

1494
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,200
researcher I'd love to see it

1495
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,059
um or just sort of personal intuition

1496
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:01,920
kind of doing this work about the

1497
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,920
connection between those two

1498
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,559
yeah it's more been listening um because

1499
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:09,599
it's more been listening to the people

1500
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,579
on the ground

1501
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:13,859
um particularly that Community up in the

1502
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:16,800
northern Cape where you have because

1503
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,180
it's like

1504
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,640
kilometers and kilometers between towns

1505
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,559
you can actually get a fairly nice feel

1506
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,960
for the impact that you've done within

1507
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,180
one town and

1508
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,220
it was really responses from the

1509
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,960
northern Cape where they say you've

1510
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,140
brought the crime down you know

1511
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,960
um now it it unfortunately we haven't

1512
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,680
got it we need to pull in the academics

1513
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,020
to get that but I agree with you I think

1514
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,059
it would be really interesting to do

1515
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:47,819
that because it's something that we know

1516
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:50,160
is happy we know is there but we don't

1517
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,680
have the we don't have the scientific

1518
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,920
white papers to be able to justify that

1519
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,900
yeah

1520
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,180
it would be hard to pin down but

1521
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,040
obviously uh super interesting that

1522
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,240
that's what you're hearing from the

1523
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,119
community members thank you we're doing

1524
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:07,319
some interesting work with the

1525
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:09,300
University of Columbia and they're going

1526
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,760
to do some surveys in the Montville on

1527
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,920
the impact of connectivity uh

1528
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,960
particularly uncapped internet access

1529
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,540
uh Tim there's also a fellow by the name

1530
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,440
of David Johnson and he's in uh Cape

1531
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,500
Town he's he's done a lot of research

1532
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,559
and they've stood up a network in Cape

1533
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:34,440
Town in one of the uh

1534
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,920
one of the communities that was unserved

1535
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,900
um happy to introduce you he's been

1536
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,700
doing a lot of research on some of the

1537
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,740
socio

1538
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,540
economic impact during the pandemic and

1539
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,180
they were driving connectivity uptake

1540
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,460
through some of their message boards

1541
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,200
with respect to trying to get proper

1542
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,839
data out about the pandemic resourcing

1543
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:57,420
versus some of the the misinformation

1544
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,180
that was being spread during that time

1545
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:03,240
yeah I've been to David's Network oh

1546
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,819
cool okay absolutely inspiring I mean

1547
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:07,880
David's an inspiring

1548
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,460
inspiring person he's he's we we're

1549
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,660
working

1550
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,119
very closely in fact I'm very interested

1551
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,080
in deploying his crypto

1552
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,559
[Music]

1553
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:21,599
um in there as an alternative to the

1554
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,000
Villa coin product that we've got in

1555
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,920
place and because he's got some

1556
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,839
different nuances which would be really

1557
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,520
interesting

1558
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,099
um and and we're also due to put down

1559
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:34,920
his he's got a little uh internet type

1560
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,079
situation where you know you can get

1561
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:39,240
onto any education or Wikipedia and

1562
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,920
other stuff for free so we're actually

1563
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,380
deploying

1564
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,000
and uh yeah shireen's actually with him

1565
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,540
today so

1566
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,660
yeah and we're working with him with

1567
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,359
some mesh solar networks from this from

1568
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:56,880
the states as well so very good yeah

1569
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,579
Althea has got a blockchain solution for

1570
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:02,579
payments um in the US one other quick

1571
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:04,799
question for you from a um sort of an RF

1572
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,240
perspective

1573
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,260
um obviously there weren't many

1574
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,599
operators in this in these kilometers

1575
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,280
that you're providing connectivity to

1576
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,140
did you find anyone trying to challenge

1577
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,079
you on setting up your networks from a

1578
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,579
oh you're you're interfering with our

1579
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:20,180
Spectrum space

1580
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,780
in some of the places in Cape Town yes

1581
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,599
yes what we have found is we interfere

1582
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,059
with our own with ourselves

1583
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,500
um

1584
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,140
yeah we would love to be able to get

1585
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,319
like home router extenders out

1586
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:39,359
to from the public Wi-Fi so that people

1587
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,700
can get it into their home and we're

1588
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,900
finding only about 50 of them are

1589
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,819
effectively connecting on and the reason

1590
01:00:47,819 --> 01:00:50,400
for that is our signal to noise ratio is

1591
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,400
too high just from ourselves and from

1592
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,640
the devices around about it so again you

1593
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,520
know it we that's one of the motivations

1594
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,819
to a cancer for six gigahertz going to

1595
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:04,680
Wi-Fi because if we could just have more

1596
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,420
Spectrum in Wi-Fi we could solve that

1597
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,339
problem straight away yeah the

1598
01:01:08,339 --> 01:01:10,440
Brazilians liberalize the entire 60 year

1599
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,599
gigahertz band for unlicensed Spectrum

1600
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,640
the Saudi Arabia has done that a little

1601
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,680
bit too Guatemala a little in this in

1602
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,900
six gigahertz and um Guatemala is coming

1603
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,119
in to do the same and the US did a

1604
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,099
little bit so that's a really good point

1605
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,319
and uh good luck with your casa on that

1606
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:27,540
because um yeah there are some folks

1607
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,920
that push back

1608
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,760
um

1609
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,440
we got a lot of pushback when I was at

1610
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,480
the internet Society on liberalization

1611
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,819
of spectrum for and certain bands and I

1612
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:37,260
think it's good to see that you could

1613
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,940
help be a good

1614
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,339
um opponent of that with with some of us

1615
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:43,500
in the in the space here

1616
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,480
um we've got about 30 seconds left

1617
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,460
anything else Tim you'd like to say

1618
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,180
before you close

1619
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,319
um no just just on that point with the

1620
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,839
casa they are very excited about the

1621
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:57,180
network you know they want to see

1622
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,339
you know

1623
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:02,160
connectivity across the the different

1624
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,000
economic strata of South Africa so you

1625
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,040
know we we're actually scheduled for

1626
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,920
them to come and look at our Network

1627
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,960
um you know to really promote six

1628
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,280
gigahertz

1629
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,619
um which we're extremely excited about

1630
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:19,260
fabulous well Tim thank you so much this

1631
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,059
was great and for folks that are there

1632
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:24,000
in the room or online participating uh

1633
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,400
the slides are up you can catch Tim at

1634
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,920
Tim at projectassesway.org and we're

1635
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,200
going to pop over to John John Suiter

1636
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,480
you're up in two seconds and I'm gonna

1637
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,980
bring your slides up but please

1638
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,359
introduce yourself

1639
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:38,520
and we'll get going on the next

1640
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,380
presentation thank you Tim and thank you

1641
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,880
Jerry thank you so much thanks everybody

1642
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:54,119
can you hear me okay

1643
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:57,720
a little muffled but we can hear you

1644
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,680
okay

1645
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,240
what can do about the muffling but but

1646
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,280
I'll try and get close

1647
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,339
so um my name is John Suiter um I used

1648
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:08,400
to be the CEO of links one of the

1649
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,559
largest internet exchanges in the world

1650
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,480
for around 20 years

1651
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,880
um I retired a couple of years ago but I

1652
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,700
seemed to be as busy as ever and I'll

1653
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,180
show you why in in a few few slides

1654
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,359
um the uh

1655
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:26,099
the talk I'm going to give today is

1656
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:27,299
about

1657
01:03:27,299 --> 01:03:29,160
um a project to

1658
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,079
write a standard for internet exchange

1659
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:34,160
neutrality so

1660
01:03:34,859 --> 01:03:37,799
and I've got 20 minutes so it's a big

1661
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:39,720
subject to try and summarize in such a

1662
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,520
short time and I'm going to talk a

1663
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,559
little bit about the background and the

1664
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:45,359
process used and then if we have time

1665
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:46,619
I'm going to show you some actual

1666
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:49,380
examples from the draft standard so you

1667
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,000
can get a feel for what it is we're

1668
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,680
trying to do

1669
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,260
so next slide please

1670
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,260
so I took into an ITF audience I figure

1671
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,940
you'll know what an internet exchange is

1672
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,859
but just as a reference point let's

1673
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:02,819
let's

1674
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:05,099
see how it's defined it's a network

1675
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:08,160
facility that enables interconnection

1676
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,200
um and the definition I've used there is

1677
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,200
from the something called ixf which if

1678
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,819
you click the link in your you'll see

1679
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:16,200
the background

1680
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,640
screen up today

1681
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,920
but internet exchanges are quite a big

1682
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,680
phenomenon they always have been fits

1683
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,079
into the very earliest days of the

1684
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:26,339
internet

1685
01:04:26,339 --> 01:04:28,020
um there's approaching a thousand of

1686
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,220
them in the world now I don't think

1687
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,559
anyone actually knows how many there are

1688
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:35,940
but there's a really cool tool deployed

1689
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,579
by important electric and in the source

1690
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:40,079
link I've given you there you

1691
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:44,099
find a list of exchanges that hurricane

1692
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:47,160
can actually track with with technology

1693
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,740
next slide

1694
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:52,980
please so this is this hurricane cycle

1695
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,319
just mentioned the

1696
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:56,640
grayed out

1697
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,260
um link there is the one from the

1698
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,240
previous slide but this one which you

1699
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,119
can access through the same mechanism

1700
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:05,579
shows you the importance given to

1701
01:05:05,579 --> 01:05:09,180
exchanges by the largest content

1702
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:12,299
networks and if you if you count down

1703
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:14,339
that list Google I for my Microsoft

1704
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:17,819
Facebook Amazon and so on represent the

1705
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:20,520
very largest content providers in

1706
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,220
and the number of exchanges they're

1707
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,940
present at is that

1708
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,740
a rather Central column

1709
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,299
um showing that many of them are at

1710
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:32,700
around 200 exchanges or approaching that

1711
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,740
number and

1712
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,900
um I think that that alone illustrates

1713
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,180
the point that they've become very

1714
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,559
important

1715
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:41,900
um to enable

1716
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,640
big content providers to access the long

1717
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,520
tail of of access providers in any

1718
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,220
particular area where these well where

1719
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:53,280
these exchanges are located

1720
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,780
um I I commend you to that hurricane

1721
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,099
site because there's lots of really

1722
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:57,540
useful data

1723
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,420
and thank you next next time

1724
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:03,960
so the premise for all of this is that

1725
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,640
internet exchanges I'm going to call a

1726
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,559
Max piece from here and play a

1727
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:09,839
significant role in both the growth and

1728
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,119
performance of the internet

1729
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:14,460
um that's quite a big presentation in

1730
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,660
itself I'm not going to try and do that

1731
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:16,799
today

1732
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,680
um but the specific topic is that many

1733
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,780
exchanges describe themselves as neutral

1734
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,520
the neutrality is actually quite

1735
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,400
important for all sorts of points of

1736
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,780
view

1737
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,940
um but unfortunately it's it's a term

1738
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:33,900
that is itself somewhat vague and and

1739
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,460
certainly differently interpreted

1740
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,440
amongst ixps and amongst high speed

1741
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,039
participants and so at the moment using

1742
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,599
that term doesn't bring a lot of value

1743
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:45,299
and in some cases can be confusing or

1744
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:48,480
down like misleading so the intention of

1745
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,359
our project is to provide a solution to

1746
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,940
that by writing a clear and well

1747
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,339
accepted definition the well-accepted is

1748
01:06:56,339 --> 01:06:58,759
a crucial port

1749
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,660
and

1750
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:01,559
um

1751
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,799
what we're hoping to to achieve is a

1752
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,440
standard that is

1753
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,760
objective it's measurable and it's

1754
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,579
verifiable and it contains the criteria

1755
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:14,339
that can be externally audited and

1756
01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:17,039
certified but let's not get ahead of

1757
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,900
ourselves establishing certification is

1758
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,400
actually not in the first phase of the

1759
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,859
project and we need a standard first and

1760
01:07:22,859 --> 01:07:24,599
again that's quite a big topic which I

1761
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:26,339
don't plan to go into today although

1762
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:28,140
feel free to ask me questions about it

1763
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,220
if you wish

1764
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,880
so let's write this General

1765
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,059
so how are we doing this well I'm I

1766
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:37,319
don't know what you can see on the video

1767
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,960
I'm proudly wearing my Manus t-shirt

1768
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,160
today

1769
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,260
um we took a lot of inspiration from the

1770
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,180
manners initiative

1771
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,859
um and

1772
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:48,900
what we want to try and Achieve as I

1773
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,520
mentioned before is something that's

1774
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,220
both widely accepted and adopted inside

1775
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:56,280
the exchange Community

1776
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,079
um and for that reason

1777
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,119
um we've we've gone we've tried to do a

1778
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:03,000
kind of fast track process

1779
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,400
um we may welcome back to the IIT

1780
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,099
efforts on major state agency although

1781
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:09,480
this kind of standard doesn't doesn't

1782
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,539
fit fantastically well with what iotf

1783
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:14,520
does there is there is some precedence

1784
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,040
and looking at how manners is developed

1785
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,679
is is an example of that so at the

1786
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,479
moment we've got a working group which

1787
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:23,698
we've charged to try and develop the

1788
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:26,960
standard we've reached for individuals

1789
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,460
with the right kind of backgrounds both

1790
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,560
from exchanges and also from exchange

1791
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,120
users

1792
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,939
um from Aspire and diverse around the

1793
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:37,738
world as we can

1794
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,560
and what we propose to do and it's

1795
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,140
illustrated by this small chart is to

1796
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,060
join the development of the standard to

1797
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,560
try and get the feedback from as many

1798
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,420
stakeholders as possible and by

1799
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,339
stakeholders we mean those exchanges

1800
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:53,759
exchange participants and also related

1801
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,520
organizations because what we want to

1802
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,799
try and Achieve is a consensus from from

1803
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:01,080
the state of Florida Community and

1804
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,759
that's a quite a significant point in

1805
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:05,399
fact it was it's interesting that it was

1806
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:07,580
a surprise to The Exchange community

1807
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,080
that we were planning to write a

1808
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,359
standard or develop a standard that

1809
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:15,179
contained more than just their news in

1810
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:17,100
fact we were we were quite surprised to

1811
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,738
be questioned about why we didn't simply

1812
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,380
bring this initiative to someone like

1813
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:25,859
euronex an association of Internet

1814
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:27,479
exchanges and have them write the

1815
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:30,420
standard and I think that naivety and

1816
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,060
insularity is is very funny and

1817
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,460
fascinating because

1818
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,140
um a standard written by the exchanges

1819
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,759
that hadn't been tested with the people

1820
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:40,859
that use the exchanges I don't think is

1821
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:43,020
is a great deal of use

1822
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,060
anyway what we're planning to do is

1823
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,339
pretty much encompasses the

1824
01:09:47,339 --> 01:09:49,979
well-established processes used by ITF

1825
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:52,560
and and other big International standard

1826
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,440
bodies like ISO which is to to go

1827
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,719
through a drafting phase and eventually

1828
01:09:57,719 --> 01:09:58,920
get to the point where you've got

1829
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,020
something stable enough to to take

1830
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,660
public comment you've then got a private

1831
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:05,280
extensive phase where you're trying to

1832
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,160
process those comments and and uh use

1833
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,940
the use what's useful and

1834
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:14,820
try to work out the consensus and and

1835
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:17,160
then you go to publication

1836
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:20,300
and excitation

1837
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,840
so what what are the expectations what

1838
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,780
what does it really mean to be a nuclear

1839
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,040
and I need to go back to First

1840
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,040
principles in our opinion this is

1841
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,960
related to both equal and a fair

1842
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,880
treatment of the ISP towards

1843
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,460
participants and also the transparency

1844
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,520
that I actually shows to maintain in the

1845
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,159
context of equality and fair treatment

1846
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:46,199
and I think I think there is a

1847
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:48,600
reasonable consensus about that to the

1848
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,580
question is what is in practice which

1849
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,440
I'll go on to talk about

1850
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,020
but of course it's not just the opinion

1851
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,400
of the of the founders of this

1852
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,040
initiative eventually the drafting of

1853
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,659
sound is going to have to take into

1854
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:02,699
account everything that the community

1855
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:04,860
feeds back and there's there is some

1856
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,540
controversy about

1857
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:09,120
um what both equal and fair teams and

1858
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,400
transparency mean and I'll try and give

1859
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:15,060
and try and give practically some among

1860
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,080
for an exciting

1861
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,340
so

1862
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,800
um here's an example I I've actually

1863
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,100
drawn out the first three Clauses of the

1864
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,480
draft standard

1865
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,340
um so I'm going to use the rest of the

1866
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,960
time to try and

1867
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,540
but I present that and give you a flavor

1868
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,600
of what's happening so this is the very

1869
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,040
first Clause of this of the draft

1870
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,860
standard and it's a self-statement

1871
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:41,880
requirement

1872
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,820
and I I this is this was actually

1873
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,739
something that I contributed and I drew

1874
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:49,739
from my past experiences standardization

1875
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:51,719
a long long time ago I was involved in

1876
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:53,640
uh programming language standard

1877
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,640
standardization and um that's a very

1878
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,920
tricky area you're generally attracting

1879
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,659
trying to write a requirement for

1880
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:04,500
something that's more precise in English

1881
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,239
um and so one of the ways you get around

1882
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,600
some of the difficulties is that you

1883
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,300
um require the the producer or

1884
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,280
distributor or whatever it is

1885
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,380
product in this case of programming

1886
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:19,980
language compiler to produce a statement

1887
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,900
of what they actually mean by their

1888
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,699
compliance with the standard typically

1889
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:26,340
because there's lots of options and lots

1890
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,219
of things that are a little bit unsaid

1891
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:32,219
um so in this case we we're going to

1892
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:34,980
we're suggesting that if the operators

1893
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,739
publish yourself a self-statement of the

1894
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:40,620
transparency neutrality and

1895
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,060
um with all the causes at the moment

1896
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,760
we're asking ourselves the question

1897
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,739
should this Clause be mandatory or not

1898
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:48,900
and what's going on there is that of

1899
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:49,920
course one of the tools of

1900
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,219
standardization is to to draw out what a

1901
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:55,380
producer of goods or services actually

1902
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,760
does

1903
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,620
um and in some cases that can be just as

1904
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,140
useful as actually making requirements

1905
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,940
on that

1906
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,820
so I know that's all sounds a bit of

1907
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,500
strict but in this case it makes no

1908
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,540
sense to have this anything other than a

1909
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,400
mandated Clause because it's really the

1910
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,060
Keystone for uh having an understanding

1911
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,640
of of how a particular exchange

1912
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,679
um complies with the standard

1913
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,440
so that's not very controversial in fact

1914
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,480
I think we we received almost Universal

1915
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,440
support so far for

1916
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,560
so we're going to the next

1917
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,320
now we get into ones where perhaps

1918
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,940
people have got

1919
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,360
attention

1920
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,620
um and

1921
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:43,580
uh what's happened here

1922
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:47,239
can we do the next slide please

1923
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,640
and that

1924
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,620
all set or

1925
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,780
could you do the next slide please sorry

1926
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,920
you bet

1927
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,940
I'm not seeing this live advance

1928
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,159
aha is are other people seeing the

1929
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,639
slides advance

1930
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:18,960
or go back can someone unmute and say

1931
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,000
Yes or No Yes are advancing from here

1932
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,060
okay thank you

1933
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,179
this pardon yeah so John

1934
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:29,400
um I'm going to slide nine which is the

1935
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,219
draft requirement

1936
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:34,500
um and it has example Clauses from the

1937
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:38,460
draft standard to published portfolio

1938
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,260
um and it says draft requirement a

1939
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,000
published service portfolio shall exist

1940
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,280
which will list all the ixp services

1941
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,440
offered by the XP and all their options

1942
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,719
that affect pricing if applicable

1943
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,460
delivery times an SLE of these Services

1944
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,020
shall be included

1945
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,000
and then the next box below that is

1946
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,100
should this glass be mandatory or not

1947
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,620
boxes below that are it is proposed to

1948
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,600
be mandatory without the in the second

1949
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,880
boxes without the said defined scope of

1950
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,920
a particular ixp claiming to be neutral

1951
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,199
is unclear so it makes no sense for it

1952
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,860
to be optional

1953
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,320
do you want me to advance to the next

1954
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,620
slide

1955
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,420
it was the same this year as I had

1956
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:22,100
before

1957
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,300
uh okay

1958
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,940
gotcha so I just refresh the browser or

1959
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:30,239
anything back so so here's a

1960
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,940
close the second closed

1961
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:36,480
um and this requires the ISP to publish

1962
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,659
a portfolio of the services they offer

1963
01:15:39,659 --> 01:15:43,380
and how any options in those Services

1964
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,420
affect things like pricing and delivery

1965
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,940
and so forth and whether or not you you

1966
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:51,300
offer an SLA and so forth and again in

1967
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:55,460
our opinion this and test it so far with

1968
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:58,080
feedback is that this should also be a

1969
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,780
mandatory Clause again it makes no real

1970
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,000
sense for it to be optional and without

1971
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,760
this the the scope of a particular ISP

1972
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,739
claiming to be neutral is is only clear

1973
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:08,880
so

1974
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,280
um we see this one as mandatory as well

1975
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,900
so let's go on to the next slide

1976
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,080
um

1977
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,060
so this is the third draft clause and

1978
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,280
This concerns a published price list

1979
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,800
and here the draft requirement is that a

1980
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,320
published price list should exist and it

1981
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,140
should be comprehensive and in

1982
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,699
particular it should be clear whether

1983
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:31,860
this is the current price list or some

1984
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:36,020
old version or or how any dependency

1985
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:38,820
should be applied for that

1986
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:41,040
and so with this one should the code be

1987
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,440
mandatory or Not Again The Proposal is

1988
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,840
is that it should be mandatory

1989
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,400
um and many people think this is going

1990
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,320
to be quite a visible sort of acid test

1991
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,320
and neutrality but it's fair to say that

1992
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,280
there are

1993
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,420
things in the world

1994
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:56,280
some of whom describe themselves as

1995
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,560
neutral who not only don't publish a

1996
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,199
price list but it appear to have a

1997
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:05,100
purely negotiable kind of price system

1998
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,600
and

1999
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,400
um now I think we're getting into into

2000
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,120
Realms of a bit more controversy because

2001
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,380
we've already heard arguments against

2002
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,199
this although to be honest I think in

2003
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,840
all cases of those arguments it's

2004
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,580
perfectly possible to produce counter

2005
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:21,960
audience

2006
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,280
um but

2007
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,040
um what it demonstrates is that we're

2008
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,980
actively considering whether or not each

2009
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,239
Clause of the standard should be

2010
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,600
mandatory or not regardless of the any

2011
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,000
controversy or difference of opinion

2012
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,219
that might be expressed

2013
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:40,020
um and I think some of this goes to

2014
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:42,000
historical issues as well which perhaps

2015
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,100
I can deal with under

2016
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,860
um q a because it's it's it wasn't to be

2017
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,179
the mainstream of what I was going to

2018
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:49,260
present today

2019
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,780
but um there's around 20 kilometers at

2020
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,000
the moment in

2021
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,440
you know so I've just had time to

2022
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,360
illustrate illustrate three of them

2023
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,140
um

2024
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,860
the moment the the

2025
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,800
mandatory but an example of where at the

2026
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,679
moment we're not considering that is

2027
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,659
reference to periodb

2028
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:11,340
so those of you who know anything about

2029
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,020
who inv know that it's an incredibly

2030
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,420
useful tool it's a community developed

2031
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,420
tool it's a it's a go-to reference place

2032
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:21,659
for information about networks and

2033
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:23,340
interconnection and internet exchanges

2034
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,620
and data centers as well

2035
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,480
um some people have argued that

2036
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,520
referencing period being the standard is

2037
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,640
a bit strange in that it doesn't appear

2038
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,159
to be within the scope of what I said

2039
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:36,480
earlier about

2040
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,540
um fair treatment or transparency but I

2041
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,520
would argue the transparency aspect is

2042
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,620
actually an incredibly important part of

2043
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,900
peering and if you can't find out who

2044
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,120
peers at a particular exchange then why

2045
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,540
should you even consider going there so

2046
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:53,940
at the moment that it's an example of a

2047
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:56,640
clause that we see as being potentially

2048
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,600
optional but but strongly encouraged

2049
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,440
rather than something that you make

2050
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,540
mandatory but again I've heard good

2051
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:06,440
arguments that the

2052
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:11,360
knits like these

2053
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,719
so where can you get more information

2054
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,140
well as a first step please go to our to

2055
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,880
our website where we've tried to tell

2056
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,980
the story in a great deal more detail

2057
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,380
and transparency ourselves and then I've

2058
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,239
been a time for doing this presentation

2059
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,739
today

2060
01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:28,560
um or you could participate in uh any or

2061
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,060
all of the Outreach events that we're

2062
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,400
planning we've actually we've we've had

2063
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,500
some already and we've got quite a

2064
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,420
program of others that we want to do we

2065
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,679
want to try and get through all these

2066
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,480
Outreach events

2067
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,100
um before we get to the geographical

2068
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,900
becoming stage so that we've taken as

2069
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,880
much as possible of the sort of

2070
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,800
stakeholder opinion into account if you

2071
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,480
don't know what all those acronyms are I

2072
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,640
apologize but they're all

2073
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:51,500
um

2074
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,940
events that happen around the world or

2075
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:57,179
names of associations that are regularly

2076
01:19:57,179 --> 01:19:59,400
um hold events

2077
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,179
um the next Cycles

2078
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,280
um so I'm I'm pretty much open to

2079
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,960
questions now but I just would like to

2080
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,020
thank and mention of thank um isoc for

2081
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,060
the encouragement and support they gave

2082
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,580
for this in the early stages and then

2083
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:17,040
our reference manners earlier

2084
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,460
um manners was was a I think a fantastic

2085
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,739
initiative of one where

2086
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:24,480
um you know the initiative with seized

2087
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,440
and moved on uh in ways that um required

2088
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,239
some extraordinary individuals to to put

2089
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:32,880
that kind of heart and soul into it

2090
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,980
um and they they got a lot of confidence

2091
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,800
support from for myself in

2092
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,540
and we took um

2093
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,580
we took great note of all of that and

2094
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:44,040
it's it's only helped us shape

2095
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,600
um how we've got to hear

2096
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,699
so I'm a little bit ahead of time and

2097
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:51,259
hopefully that gives an opportunity

2098
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,219
have time so um is there anyone in the

2099
01:20:56,219 --> 01:20:58,699
queue

2100
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,040
questions Mallory I saw that you had

2101
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,100
some questions online did you wanna

2102
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,840
ask those questions

2103
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:10,100
um in the quick q a

2104
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,400
hey

2105
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,380
um hi everybody nice to see you this is

2106
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,360
Mallory normal for the center for

2107
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,920
democracy and Technology I asked in the

2108
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,179
chat about

2109
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:26,580
um where the working group is chartered

2110
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:28,620
but then I read on your website the very

2111
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,760
helpful

2112
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,699
um our story section that describes your

2113
01:21:32,699 --> 01:21:34,199
journey but wondered if you wanted to

2114
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:35,280
talk a little about that because I'm

2115
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,540
sure others would find it interesting

2116
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,360
yes I mean it's I feel very conscious of

2117
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,219
talking about it in the United States

2118
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:47,280
I mean I think if this had been more

2119
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,699
mainstream IDF territory there's no

2120
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:52,500
doubt that we would have

2121
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:57,420
um uh come to ITF for it the trouble is

2122
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,640
that starting a new initiative from

2123
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,739
scratch would be standardization issue

2124
01:22:01,739 --> 01:22:04,860
in scratch and bringing it through a

2125
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:09,360
body like iitfri so is it it takes a lot

2126
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,460
of time and effort

2127
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:14,460
um and typically you need a great weight

2128
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,080
of

2129
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:16,679
um

2130
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:19,199
people or organizations behind it to do

2131
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,000
that they also like you to bring

2132
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,640
something that's fully formed you know

2133
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,620
they don't like you to to come with an

2134
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,659
initiative to say hey here's an

2135
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:29,580
interesting topic let's talk about that

2136
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:30,780
for a bit and see if the standard

2137
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,280
emerges

2138
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,900
um so

2139
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,900
in trying to pass some of the tests to

2140
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,260
get an initiative like this movie

2141
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:42,420
um I think eventually we talked

2142
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,239
ourselves into the position which which

2143
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,860
we've written in the website as you've

2144
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:49,560
observed with under our story that you

2145
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,199
know let's get started I think there is

2146
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:53,880
a question about who should be the

2147
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:57,060
guardian of the intellectual property or

2148
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,400
something like this when you get to the

2149
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,840
well you never get to the end that's

2150
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,820
something one of the learning points

2151
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,620
from standardization you think about

2152
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,420
publishing the standard in the end but

2153
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,280
of course it isn't you know someone's

2154
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,880
got to own it and maintain it from there

2155
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,219
and in order to sort of satisfy people

2156
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:16,020
about that

2157
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:18,960
um having establishing the standard on

2158
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,239
an appropriate open source license again

2159
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:23,520
looking at what matters did

2160
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,620
um is the sort of lead that we've

2161
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:26,940
followed

2162
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,260
um I don't know whether that's in a

2163
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:31,440
detail to to answer the question

2164
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,540
um I mean I think when when it comes to

2165
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,360
this stakeholders some of them are

2166
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,400
already organized into

2167
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,860
you know associations or groups or clubs

2168
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:43,320
and that that you can readily go and

2169
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,960
consult with but that isn't true

2170
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,300
okay and I think when we look for the

2171
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:51,000
Youth we expect at the standard after

2172
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
after the first one is published

2173
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,560
um there are still many areas in the

2174
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,640
world

2175
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,860
um where internet exchanges are not as

2176
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,600
well established and you know there

2177
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,219
hasn't been quite the same tradition as

2178
01:24:02,219 --> 01:24:04,440
for example here in Europe

2179
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,860
um and in some cases the markets

2180
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:10,040
themselves don't really

2181
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,659
suit internet exchanges because for

2182
01:24:12,659 --> 01:24:14,280
example telecommunications have not been

2183
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,940
liberalized either fully or in any real

2184
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:20,699
sense and so where governments are

2185
01:24:20,699 --> 01:24:23,040
hesitant about those kinds of things and

2186
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,020
they're not sure what role incident

2187
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:28,380
exchange would or should have and what

2188
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:30,179
we're hoping is there'll be a kind of

2189
01:24:30,179 --> 01:24:31,560
Beacon effect for

2190
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,900
fact that there'll be a greater

2191
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,900
propensity to liberalize markets because

2192
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,820
you don't have to think in terms of just

2193
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,260
the old

2194
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,179
um State Telco being they're kind of be

2195
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:44,340
all an indoor for interconnection within

2196
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:45,900
the country and it's interesting that

2197
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,580
the two presentations that came before

2198
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,640
me both both fully Illustrated that

2199
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,500
problem you know you'd think United

2200
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:56,100
States had got you know it was such a

2201
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,900
rich country that all of this would be

2202
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,719
long solved well it isn't and garage

2203
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:02,340
presentation I think was a classic

2204
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,320
illustration of that and then when it

2205
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,000
comes to South Africa you know actually

2206
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,640
South Africa isn't beaten in African

2207
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,159
terms in terms of interconnection but

2208
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:13,260
it's still so far behind the curve

2209
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:15,600
compared to most of the world that you

2210
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,400
know it makes it hardly to think that

2211
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,320
you know projects like the woman just

2212
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,480
heard about have to run in order to

2213
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,940
address some of these problems there is

2214
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:25,739
in fact a massive internet Exchange in

2215
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:28,140
South Africa is in the top 10 in the

2216
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:31,320
world which is an incredible achievement

2217
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,300
um but you know the back story to that

2218
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,179
is is rather complex and yet it's a

2219
01:25:36,179 --> 01:25:37,739
neutral exchange it's an absolute

2220
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:39,840
Paradigm of the kind of things that we

2221
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,000
would like to see in this in this

2222
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,980
standard when we

2223
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:46,739
were so I don't know others thank you

2224
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:48,540
John we do have someone in the queue we

2225
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:51,060
have Hans Peter uh whose last name I'm

2226
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,440
not going to try and pronounce her in my

2227
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,560
Massacre it so Hans Dieter you are up

2228
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,760
thank you so I was considering uh or at

2229
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,199
least thinking of what you mentioned

2230
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,900
with transparency and I asked myself are

2231
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,580
you also considering a security

2232
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,739
incidence in transparency with respect

2233
01:26:07,739 --> 01:26:10,020
to that because I personally had an

2234
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:11,520
experience of hacking into an internet

2235
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,340
exchange and I was quite surprised that

2236
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:18,060
I mean you suddenly have control over a

2237
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:20,880
very important Point uh and then well

2238
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,520
they sent me a beer package to thank me

2239
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,400
but I mean that's that's not the way you

2240
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,560
should deal with this I mean I I would

2241
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,600
be very interested in sort of seeing a

2242
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,360
public record of security incidents for

2243
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,340
instance so that we can actually improve

2244
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:36,000
it

2245
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,100
yeah this has already come up I think

2246
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,860
it's uh I think it's a fascinating uh

2247
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:42,719
aspect and again I I'm concerned that we

2248
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,719
don't have enough time today to deal

2249
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:47,699
properly with your question I think in

2250
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:50,400
principle there's no reason why

2251
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,900
um such a thing shouldn't be considered

2252
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,639
in the standard and I think you're quite

2253
01:26:53,639 --> 01:26:54,780
right

2254
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:56,880
um what people want to know about it's

2255
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,080
what people want to have confidence

2256
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,280
about Exchange

2257
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,880
a place where you come to share your

2258
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,820
others and if you are concerned that

2259
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,400
either the exchange is vulnerable to

2260
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,860
hacking or perhaps worse is being

2261
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,620
controlled and or monitored

2262
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,199
um by government entities then you're

2263
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:18,199
going to be a lot less

2264
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:21,600
uh keen on the idea of using it as a

2265
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,580
place for interconnect and indeed you

2266
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,679
know we we know that some exchanges in

2267
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,620
the world are essentially serving

2268
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:30,480
government agencies by allowing

2269
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,219
themselves to be mirrored or tapped in

2270
01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:33,420
some way

2271
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,340
um and nobody thinks that that's a great

2272
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:36,300
idea

2273
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,280
from you know from almost any point of

2274
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,420
view

2275
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,840
um I think it's you know I I'd have to

2276
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,699
go into predictive mode to tell you what

2277
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:46,199
I thought might happen about this one

2278
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:48,360
but but it's already come up

2279
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:51,420
um and it's already an issue of the

2280
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,639
degree of transparency that people

2281
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:56,520
should consider that changes should have

2282
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,060
and one example of that is having

2283
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,639
something that I think the jargon

2284
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,620
phrases weren't canary

2285
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,840
um you know have you got some way of

2286
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,300
saying to us that you know you're not

2287
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:12,060
subject to tapping or mirroring

2288
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,800
um and can we rely on that in other

2289
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,659
words will we know that the war is the

2290
01:28:15,659 --> 01:28:18,120
analogy is with canaries and the minds

2291
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,760
you know if the canary dies then get out

2292
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,080
of there quickly because it's likely

2293
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,880
that the oxygen run out

2294
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,440
um you know can you have some mechanism

2295
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,320
like that that you can rely on in

2296
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,300
shared space like an internet exchange

2297
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,219
so I can't give you any kind of

2298
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:34,560
definitive answer but yes it's already

2299
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,580
up and certainly it's something that

2300
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,639
will

2301
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,650
thank you

2302
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:42,060
[Music]

2303
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,980
thank you does anyone else have a

2304
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:47,419
question for John

2305
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,380
all right well John thank you very much

2306
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:54,360
for presenting and everyone is looking

2307
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,460
forward to seeing um how things move

2308
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:57,600
forward

2309
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,000
um and given the IX space I think it's

2310
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,020
really interesting to see that there's a

2311
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,600
um a way people are trying to look at

2312
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,460
leveling the playing field

2313
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:09,780
thank you again appreciate the

2314
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,280
opportunity

2315
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,480

um we recently won uh my group I'm sorry

2328
01:29:46,139 --> 01:29:47,699
I'm associate professor at the

2329
01:29:47,699 --> 01:29:49,320
University of Washington

2330
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,900
um working on uh internet access and

2331
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:54,000
obviously co-chairing here

2332
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
um the uh the team here running the

2333
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,280
Seattle Community Network uh won the

2334
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,980
IEEE connecting unconnected challenge

2335
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,080
um and I will be giving the talk from

2336
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,540
that here uh it is unfortunately a

2337
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:07,739
little high level

2338
01:30:07,739 --> 01:30:09,300
um so I'm happy to chat with you all

2339
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,400
about some of the details

2340
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,280
um uh forward but I do not yet see my

2341
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,560
slides

2342
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,560
foreign

2343
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:28,860
[Music]

2344
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:30,840
they're not showing up in the deck to

2345
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:31,800
share

2346
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,320
that's a huge drag

2347
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,940
um

2348
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:39,239
let's see I've refreshed I can see it I

2349
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:41,219
just can't

2350
01:30:41,219 --> 01:30:43,440
the links are updated but it's not

2351
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,080
syncing with the share the preloaded

2352
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,480
slides should I just share my screen

2353
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:53,219
yeah go for it give it a see if it works

2354
01:30:53,219 --> 01:30:57,480
I'll see if it works huh do I want to

2355
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,379
share my screen yes

2356
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,139
okay we're gonna get recursive here for

2357
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:18,179
a second whoa

2358
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:20,360
whoa

2359
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,620
can you share

2360
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:25,760
are you seeing it now

2361
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,420
yes or no yep yes sir we are go for it

2362
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,520
okay great

2363
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,560
I'm glad to see that that worked out all

2364
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,199
right so yeah uh as mentioned um this is

2365
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:39,120
uh a talk uh that we gave at the

2366
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,100
connecting on connected challenge

2367
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:44,280
um uh it's a proof of concept so fairly

2368
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,620
early stage uh I presented similar work

2369
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,960
here at Gaia a few times now uh talking

2370
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,639
about this project and so it's also a

2371
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,980
little bit of an update

2372
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:55,679
uh so for this project uh as you'll hear

2373
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,199
partners are very very critical uh and

2374
01:31:58,199 --> 01:32:00,420
indeed the whole system will not work uh

2375
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:02,100
without them specifically it's come a

2376
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,719
Cooperative Network Reckless research

2377
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:05,940
Tacoma Public Library

2378
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,920
um uh all have done enormous heavy

2379
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,320
lifting uh in terms of uh what we're

2380
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,120
doing here and so I wanted to make sure

2381
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,159
we called them out

2382
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:16,320
so just to start

2383
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,360
um it may surprise people especially in

2384
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,159
this group to be running uh that we're

2385
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,320
running an Access Project in Seattle of

2386
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,460
all places

2387
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,139
Seattle uh those of you who have not

2388
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:26,580
been here is indeed one of the most

2389
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:29,699
connected places in the world uh us the

2390
01:32:29,699 --> 01:32:31,380
home of Amazon

2391
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:34,739
um the sort of home of Microsoft or

2392
01:32:34,739 --> 01:32:37,440
across the water over in Redmond an

2393
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,600
enormous amount of other companies uh

2394
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,520
that you would have heard of

2395
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:43,440
um and uh

2396
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,780
you know towards that point 95 of

2397
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:48,780
satellites according to a recent survey

2398
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:50,100
um from the city of Seattle have access

2399
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,900
to the internet but

2400
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:53,699
my research group really works on

2401
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:55,139
connecting marginalized populations

2402
01:32:55,139 --> 01:32:58,500
people who have access issues

2403
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:01,139
um and 95 is not a hundred so really who

2404
01:33:01,139 --> 01:33:03,060
are those five percent in Seattle well

2405
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:04,440
it's kind of what you'd expect poverty

2406
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:05,820
is a defining feature of those without

2407
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:07,739
internet access

2408
01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:10,679
um disability uh English as the same

2409
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:11,880
language

2410
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:14,159
um older uh and racial and I think

2411
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:16,500
minorities all of these are the kind of

2412
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,900
populations that we like to work with as

2413
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,040
researchers

2414
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,900
um and so we've spun up an Access

2415
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,760
Project to see if we can try to bring

2416
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,820
connectivity uh to those uh uh people in

2417
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:27,840
town

2418
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,060
uh and that is uh the Seattle Community

2419
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:31,739
Network it's really underlying the

2420
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:33,000
technical agenda here that we're going

2421
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,080
to speak through

2422
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,820
um the Seattle Community Network is a

2423
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:37,860
free or low-class Access Network that we

2424
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,460
deploy throughout the city it uses LTE

2425
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:42,600
and provides access to people who can't

2426
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,600
afford to pay for network devices uh uh

2427
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,159
can't afford for to pay for internet

2428
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:49,260
access even when there's uh discounted

2429
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,520
plans available which there are in

2430
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,840
Seattle if you're able to demonstrate

2431
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,900
that you are low income you can get a 10

2432
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:57,420
a month plan from Comcast but even that

2433
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:59,580
plan has a number of strings attached to

2434
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,920
it uh I think you need to live there for

2435
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,120
a certain number of months to

2436
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,679
demonstrate

2437
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:07,440
um that you're you're situated there you

2438
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,179
have to demonstrate these income uh

2439
01:34:09,179 --> 01:34:10,800
properties all of which are really hard

2440
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,580
if you're for instance uh um unhomed and

2441
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,679
moving around uh and these kind of

2442
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:18,780
problems similarly we provide some

2443
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:19,980
educational materials that I'll talk

2444
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:20,940
through for people who don't actually

2445
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:23,040
know how to use access networks

2446
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,860
um and uh the network is is is is

2447
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,780
rolling out and growing as of right

2448
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:29,760
right now it consists of seven sites

2449
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,620
eight if you're really generous and you

2450
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:34,620
include the UW test site but it's at

2451
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,300
these partners that we spoke of the

2452
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,980
Filipino Community Center Aroma Cultural

2453
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,840
Center so local community cultural

2454
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,639
centers uh local high schools Garfield

2455
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:43,560
and Franklin High School

2456
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,360
um and then some libraries Skyway

2457
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,400
library and Tacoma Public Library so

2458
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,020
really again what we do is we work with

2459
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:50,580
Partners we try to connect people

2460
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:51,719
through

2461
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:53,580
um through them

2462
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:55,440
now traditionally these kind of access

2463
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,880
networks have been really hard to build

2464
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,580
it's even been touched on slightly in

2465
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,500
today's talks I heard mention of just

2466
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:04,440
like Wireless not being a possibility uh

2467
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,780
in in for some of the funding sources in

2468
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:08,340
Michigan uh which I think is a little

2469
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,139
bit of a shame there's certainly uh

2470
01:35:10,139 --> 01:35:12,840
fiber is is the best but there's a lot

2471
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,120
of places and a lot of access idioms

2472
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,460
where Wireless makes a lot of sense

2473
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,800
um and uh fortunately there's been

2474
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,139
significant progress on these

2475
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:23,820
um it used to be when I was running

2476
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:26,040
these networks that cellular Spectrum

2477
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,540
was a big problem it was just

2478
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,400
foundationally unavailable for a small

2479
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,679
operator use but cbrs the citizens

2480
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,480
Broadband Radio Service went live in

2481
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,239
April 2020 and GAA Spectrum General

2482
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:38,460
access spectrum is readily available in

2483
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:39,840
our region here you can see on the right

2484
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,120
is a map of of this and you can see that

2485
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:44,159
there's little uh there's there's access

2486
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:45,960
issues in Everett and Bremerton both of

2487
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:49,560
which are Naval bases but generally uh

2488
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,440
fallow Spectrum all around similarly

2489
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,880
equipment used to be really really

2490
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,980
expensive and this was when you had to

2491
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:58,139
go to Nokia to buy things and they were

2492
01:35:58,139 --> 01:35:59,760
really selling telecoms and so they were

2493
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,920
trying to kind of bleed everything but

2494
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,800
with the growth of Lte specifically uh

2495
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:08,639
private networks and wireless isps it's

2496
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:12,540
become a much more commoditized uh

2497
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,520
Marketplace and so you see small scale

2498
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,380
vendors Buy sales can be I'm able to

2499
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:19,739
come in and really drive the price of

2500
01:36:19,739 --> 01:36:23,520
that down to low or mid thousands uh ten

2501
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,739
thousands of of cost when this stuff

2502
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:27,300
used to be 10 000 on its own so like

2503
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:28,560
four thousand instead of ten thousand

2504
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,080
it's really great

2505
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:34,020
um but having done this for a while

2506
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,179
trying to trying to

2507
01:36:36,179 --> 01:36:37,920
turn these kind of organizations these

2508
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,580
small community organizations into isps

2509
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,860
um uh I guess I should rephrase that the

2510
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:46,679
the goal of this project is to empower

2511
01:36:46,679 --> 01:36:48,540
these Community facing organizations to

2512
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:49,980
connect their communities right they are

2513
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:52,860
the best at engaging with the

2514
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:54,239
communities that they work with and this

2515
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:57,000
kind of uh marginalized populations that

2516
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,480
that they are built to serve right but

2517
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,100
having done this for a while we've run

2518
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:03,420
networks in the Philippines we've run

2519
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:05,760
networks in Indonesia we've run networks

2520
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,920
um in the Canadian Arctic we still are

2521
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,120
um what we've learned is essentially

2522
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,280
that these kind of organizations don't

2523
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,280
want to become isps uh at the end of the

2524
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,440
day they have a mandate right and that

2525
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,719
mandate is to support those communities

2526
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:20,100
around them and that often includes

2527
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,540
internet access they really want to

2528
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:23,340
provide internet to those communities

2529
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:25,260
but they don't want to grow larger than

2530
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:26,900
that they don't want to

2531
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:29,820
run fiber all around their their their

2532
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:32,460
uh their Community because then they

2533
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:34,139
become an ISP and it sort of dominates

2534
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,840
their their business and they're small

2535
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,100
nonprofits that's not what they want to

2536
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,260
do this makes scaling these kind of

2537
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,719
solutions really hard right so they grow

2538
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:44,820
to a sort of natural size which is tens

2539
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:47,580
of users often and that's it growing

2540
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:49,199
beyond that it requires fundamental

2541
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:51,239
organizational change which is out of

2542
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:53,880
scope so as a solution what we aren't

2543
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,580
aiming to do in this project is to allow

2544
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,620
the networks to scale horizontally

2545
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:01,199
essentially adding more small networks

2546
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:02,699
rather than vertically trying to make

2547
01:38:02,699 --> 01:38:05,159
the networks really big and this is

2548
01:38:05,159 --> 01:38:06,840
somewhat antithetical to the way

2549
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,219
networks are built these days you can

2550
01:38:08,219 --> 01:38:10,199
see there's just so much infrastructure

2551
01:38:10,199 --> 01:38:12,020
and

2552
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:14,159
grant funding that really is about

2553
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,800
scaling up individual organizations but

2554
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,120
there were researchers so we get to do

2555
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,400
things in different ways and so our

2556
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,560
solution is both social and Technical

2557
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,120
but the technical piece here is

2558
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,739
developing a new Federated core Network

2559
01:38:25,739 --> 01:38:27,300
that allows for this that allows small

2560
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:28,739
Community Network sites to partner

2561
01:38:28,739 --> 01:38:30,540
together to provide this kind of wide

2562
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,699
area coverage so it looks a little like

2563
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:33,960
this some of you have seen these slides

2564
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,040
before

2565
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:35,639
um

2566
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:37,440
in a traditional mno on the top you can

2567
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,020
imagine the red network is 18 T the

2568
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:42,239
green network is T-Mobile and on the

2569
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:43,739
bottom is our Cooperative solution in

2570
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:45,060
which case there are like many many

2571
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:48,120
networks right uh red black blue purple

2572
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,639
green all of them are running in the

2573
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,800
area with a smaller number of access

2574
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,980
points there in a traditional Network

2575
01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:58,560
though carriers compete right so at T

2576
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,580
will have coverage in some place

2577
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,080
T-Mobile have coverage in some place

2578
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,460
often they'll have coverage in the same

2579
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:05,340
places but sometimes it'll be better or

2580
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:07,620
worse uh for for one of them in the

2581
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:08,820
Cooperative model it's different what we

2582
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,139
really want to do is have these all work

2583
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:12,420
together to provide connectivity to look

2584
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:14,580
like one big mno even though it's a

2585
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:16,920
bunch of small community Networks the

2586
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,719
key piece of this is that in a

2587
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,100
traditional Network users only connect

2588
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:21,480
to their home network right if you're an

2589
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,040
ATT subscriber you go into the ATT

2590
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,960
Network you never go under the T-Mobile

2591
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,760
network except under certain emergency

2592
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:29,820
circumstances and uh uh enrolling which

2593
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,739
we'll talk about but in our solution

2594
01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:33,300
what we do is we actually allow you to

2595
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,620
connect to all of the other community

2596
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,540
networks using this a system we call

2597
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:39,260
d-off which I'll speak to

2598
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:42,060
the roaming solution we need needs to

2599
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,340
allow people to move between the various

2600
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:45,900
Community Network nodes while also

2601
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:47,820
meeting the needs of of allowing more

2602
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:49,980
Community Network Partners to be created

2603
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,960
right and this involves a number of

2604
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,880
technical bits here the most important

2605
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:55,500
of which is to say that Community

2606
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,260
infrastructure can be less stable what

2607
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:59,639
we need to be able to do is handle

2608
01:39:59,639 --> 01:40:02,040
failure these are going to be low-cost

2609
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,239
units these are going to be

2610
01:40:03,239 --> 01:40:04,500
organizations that may not have the

2611
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,880
technical chops

2612
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,860
um to keep stuff running with five nines

2613
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:09,900
as you expect of a telecom and so

2614
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,219
instead of what we want to do is build a

2615
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:12,480
lot of networks have overlapping

2616
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:13,679
coverage and you can fall back to

2617
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,719
another network if one of those fail so

2618
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:17,580
redundancy as a way to provide that that

2619
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:20,940
model of service second to this we

2620
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:22,800
really can't just share Network State

2621
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,020
the simplest way to do this is to Simply

2622
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,179
share your network Keys around all of

2623
01:40:27,179 --> 01:40:29,880
the nodes in the network but uh that has

2624
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,739
a number of security implications that

2625
01:40:31,739 --> 01:40:34,020
we don't want so instead we're going to

2626
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:34,920
come up with something else and then

2627
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,300
lastly of course this all has to work on

2628
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,580
commodity off-the-shelf handsets we

2629
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:40,440
can't expect people to buy new handsets

2630
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,600
fit into it okay

2631
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,760
so how does this work here's traditional

2632
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:48,000
Roman here we have a large centralized

2633
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,179
core and this is often in the data

2634
01:40:51,179 --> 01:40:52,260
center there's one in North Seattle

2635
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:53,940
handles hundreds of thousands of

2636
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:55,320
subscribers

2637
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:58,020
um and in that data center is stored all

2638
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:01,139
of your authentication uh information so

2639
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,520
if you're let's say a British Telecom

2640
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,440
customer and you come to Seattle

2641
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:06,179
um it'll talk to the ATT network but

2642
01:41:06,179 --> 01:41:08,340
it'll actually build an ipsec tunnel

2643
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:10,860
all the way back to British telecoms

2644
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:13,440
core Network to authenticate you

2645
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,000
now this works it works when you have

2646
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,560
really big Hardware that's where the

2647
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,480
redundancy is built in it works when

2648
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:21,060
roaming is not a super common situation

2649
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:22,260
um but it's not going to work for us

2650
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:23,340
we're going to have a lot more roaming

2651
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:25,080
and we're gonna have a lot more uh core

2652
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,400
networks down

2653
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,920
so our solution is this uh it's called

2654
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:31,260
The Off the big idea here is again to

2655
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:32,520
support this model we have a number of

2656
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,560
small core networks one for each partner

2657
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,600
organization each handling tens to

2658
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:38,159
hundreds of subscribers now these are

2659
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,040
going to run on low-cost Edge Hardware

2660
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,360
that being kind of a Nook we've

2661
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:43,860
mentioned before the new unit of compute

2662
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:45,719
like Intel like small box a couple

2663
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:49,139
hundred bucks now to make this work in

2664
01:41:49,139 --> 01:41:50,520
the way that we want because those nodes

2665
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,739
are going to go down what we do is we do

2666
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:53,820
pre-compute these things called

2667
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:56,760
authentication vectors now these are

2668
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,639
basically allow a network to our user to

2669
01:41:59,639 --> 01:42:00,780
authenticate to a network without

2670
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:03,179
sharing their Network keys so your core

2671
01:42:03,179 --> 01:42:06,000
Network the home network generates these

2672
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,800
Keys hands them to nearby partner

2673
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,380
networks this allows you to roam onto

2674
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:11,639
those networks

2675
01:42:11,639 --> 01:42:13,739
um and even if the if your core network

2676
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:15,900
isn't available we then build a public

2677
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:17,400
distributed directory of these networks

2678
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,480
so that you can see what kind of

2679
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:19,860
networks you want to talk to and who you

2680
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:21,000
can trust

2681
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,619
um

2682
01:42:22,619 --> 01:42:24,480
key Point again we have this is super

2683
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,500
high level

2684
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,780
um d-off solution allows for low-cost

2685
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:28,860
hardware and the small community

2686
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:30,480
networks while maintaining that kind of

2687
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,159
expected Network resilience performance

2688
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:34,020
it looks like a major Telecom with the

2689
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:35,219
kind of properties that you'd expect

2690
01:42:35,219 --> 01:42:37,440
while being built out of these number of

2691
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,300
small community Networks

2692
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:41,460
uh this is my hand waving slide we're

2693
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:44,820
writing a paper about it uh basically

2694
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:49,260
um it works the registrations it can

2695
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:50,159
handle a number of registrations

2696
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:51,480
apparently it starts to look more and

2697
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,760
more like a traditional core network but

2698
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:54,960
I'm going to hand wave all that just to

2699
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,520
say that we're doing it and the numbers

2700
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,440
look good

2701
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,900
now key to this whole mission is that

2702
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,580
while we have this technical agenda and

2703
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:04,380
we're researchers and we really need to

2704
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:06,360
have that to be able to get funding and

2705
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:09,420
uh and do our work we recognize that's

2706
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:11,580
not the whole problem right and so the

2707
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:13,440
Sam Community Network while able

2708
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,540
enabling us to engage in these kind of

2709
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:17,520
research agendas does things on top of

2710
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,719
that to support the Community

2711
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:21,119
Development itself this includes stuff

2712
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:24,540
like Service Learning uh so people come

2713
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:27,119
out students and also community members

2714
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:29,340
um to teach the community how the

2715
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:30,840
internet works

2716
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:31,980
um these are these are Community

2717
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,540
educational workshops we have hack

2718
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:36,480
nights disco techs um at the Filipino

2719
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,980
Community Center for example people come

2720
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,780
in ask about their devices ask about

2721
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:41,520
what kind of problems they have and

2722
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,020
concurrent to this we're also running a

2723
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,639
digital stewards program for both Youth

2724
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,080
and adults this really trains people

2725
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,580
foundationally about how the internet

2726
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:49,500
works uh so that they can help us do

2727
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,179
installs and maintain the network going

2728
01:43:51,179 --> 01:43:53,100
forward

2729
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,840
these digital stewards are given

2730
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:56,520
Hands-On Computing education and job

2731
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,860
training towards the technical skills

2732
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:00,360
needed to run the network

2733
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,040
all right

2734
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,199
things like principles of networking are

2735
01:44:04,199 --> 01:44:05,580
really foundational on the ground stuff

2736
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:07,020
like configuring radios building

2737
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:08,699
ethernet cables and then the community

2738
01:44:08,699 --> 01:44:10,800
piece of it as well allowing people to

2739
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:15,060
come together uh and uh doorknob uh and

2740
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:16,980
be good community members and and build

2741
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:18,900
the community as participants

2742
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:20,760
um themselves

2743
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,739
uh lastly we also envisioned this

2744
01:44:22,739 --> 01:44:24,420
network as what we're calling a teaching

2745
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:27,000
Network so I put akin to a teaching

2746
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,340
hospital if you've ever heard of this

2747
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,619
um it provides low-cost internet but it

2748
01:44:31,619 --> 01:44:33,420
also is a space for us to do this kind

2749
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:35,159
of research and to engage students in

2750
01:44:35,159 --> 01:44:36,719
the Practical Hands-On elements of

2751
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:39,540
networking so this allows us to build

2752
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,219
this community of practice around

2753
01:44:41,219 --> 01:44:43,020
networking and engage with other

2754
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:44,460
communities around us that have interest

2755
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:46,380
in this for example a number of my

2756
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:48,420
students volunteer at the tribal uh

2757
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:50,699
Broadband boot camp uh similarly a

2758
01:44:50,699 --> 01:44:52,260
bringing digital stewards from our

2759
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:54,179
classes as well so everyone builds the

2760
01:44:54,179 --> 01:44:55,860
capacity to not just learn about the

2761
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:57,360
technology but learn about teaching the

2762
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,639
technology so that we can keep that ball

2763
01:44:59,639 --> 01:45:01,619
rolling and and get more people engaged

2764
01:45:01,619 --> 01:45:03,480
both in our Network and outside of our

2765
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:04,560
Network

2766
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,659
uh in conclusion I want to mention that

2767
01:45:06,659 --> 01:45:08,400
d-off is not yet in prod we're really

2768
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:09,600
trying to figure that out right now this

2769
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,699
is an operational Network and so it's a

2770
01:45:11,699 --> 01:45:13,560
little hard to pull the rug and come in

2771
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:15,659
with research code but that's I think a

2772
01:45:15,659 --> 01:45:17,100
fun problem for us as researchers

2773
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,960
however the teaching material is well

2774
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,580
tested and available and everything we

2775
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:22,619
do is produced in open

2776
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:27,559
uh so uh thanks and I'll stop there

2777
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:30,659
fabulous you've got quite a bit of time

2778
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:33,179
here for Q a Curtis yeah this is a quick

2779
01:45:33,179 --> 01:45:36,179
talk no it's awesome I love the teaching

2780
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:38,159
aspect of it too

2781
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:41,820
folks anyone in the room would like to

2782
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:44,299
ask questions

2783
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:49,580
if not I have a question for you Curtis

2784
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,159
all right

2785
01:45:53,159 --> 01:45:55,020
and Curtis you had mentioned earlier I

2786
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:57,300
think that um did you have any do you

2787
01:45:57,300 --> 01:45:59,520
have any issues with interference

2788
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,260
um other networks so anyone complaining

2789
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:03,119
about the build

2790
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,880
not at all it's been kind of amazing to

2791
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:09,360
see how open cbrs is we know that there

2792
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:13,500
were a number of uh licenses given this

2793
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:16,380
is for the priority elements but it

2794
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:18,300
seems to be underutilized and what I

2795
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:19,800
understand is essentially that the

2796
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:23,340
telecoms while hungry for spectrum feel

2797
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:25,800
as though it's potentially too unstable

2798
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,980
for them to run stuff on

2799
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:31,679
um and so we'll see in the future I

2800
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:33,420
think as this message comes out that

2801
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:36,659
that cbrs is underutilized you'll see

2802
01:46:36,659 --> 01:46:38,400
some more people leaning into it but as

2803
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,380
of now absolutely not and especially

2804
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:42,179
like Google's we're using Google's SAS

2805
01:46:42,179 --> 01:46:44,280
for this you can go online and see and

2806
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:45,540
there's just an enormous amount of

2807
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:46,800
spectrum everywhere that I've given

2808
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,000
talks

2809
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,520
um and I think what's interesting to me

2810
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:54,000
is how and if cbrs will be impactful

2811
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,400
internationally as well so for instance

2812
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,380
I believe in Canada they're not using

2813
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:00,739
cbrs it's just normal license Spectrum

2814
01:47:00,739 --> 01:47:04,260
but the fact is that but it's still like

2815
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:05,520
um

2816
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,619
it's easier to access but the

2817
01:47:07,619 --> 01:47:09,179
expectation is basically like we don't

2818
01:47:09,179 --> 01:47:10,800
need this big SAS system we don't need

2819
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,420
any of that heavy lifting just ask us

2820
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:13,560
for spectrum and we'll give it to you

2821
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,119
like a normal system

2822
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,760
um yeah but the reality is that the gear

2823
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:21,119
in the CBR Spectrum like in band 42 band

2824
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:22,260
43

2825
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:23,880
um is being produced at scale because

2826
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,739
these networks are being used in the US

2827
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:27,600
and so now there's this body of these

2828
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,600
devices which are readily available and

2829
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,860
so there's going to be pressure on

2830
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:34,380
Regulators all over to allow them to use

2831
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:35,760
these devices because they're cheap so

2832
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,380
we'll see but yeah we haven't had any

2833
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:39,119
issues which has been one of those big

2834
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:42,000
bets that we made that seems to be uh

2835
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,920
um uh working out

2836
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,780
yeah there's a great Network called open

2837
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:48,780
Broadband in North Carolina sorry let me

2838
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:50,460
say that slower for folks who are

2839
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,619
listening and me talking too fast with

2840
01:47:52,619 --> 01:47:55,380
coffee North Carolina and Curtis that

2841
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:58,320
network is also moving across the the

2842
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:01,020
state borders into Virginia and into

2843
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:03,060
South Carolina on the east coast of the

2844
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:05,280
United States and like you they've had

2845
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,900
no troubles the local government is

2846
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,840
fully behind them and I think hers we

2847
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,460
can tell the folks here too that you got

2848
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:13,619
in Seattle and Washington State you can

2849
01:48:13,619 --> 01:48:15,719
you can actually run a community-based

2850
01:48:15,719 --> 01:48:18,480
network but in like 18 of the other U.S

2851
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,159
states you can't because it's not

2852
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:22,679
allowed to have networks like those it's

2853
01:48:22,679 --> 01:48:25,020
part of the old Telco lobbying Network

2854
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,960
that got into the local parliaments to

2855
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,880
block networks like that but cbrs is

2856
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:32,460
well and alive and lots of folks are at

2857
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:34,380
least trying to roll out not lots but

2858
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:35,880
some some networks are doing great like

2859
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,100
yours and theirs and um

2860
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,840
um yeah there are some other interesting

2861
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,219
ones too we've been talking with New

2862
01:48:41,219 --> 01:48:42,600
York Public Library they're running a

2863
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,580
cbrs network now

2864
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:46,619
um there's it's just popping up in very

2865
01:48:46,619 --> 01:48:48,840
interesting places because this capacity

2866
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:50,760
is just suddenly there and some people

2867
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,679
are flipping lights on and

2868
01:48:52,679 --> 01:48:54,659
um we had heard about the City of Yakima

2869
01:48:54,659 --> 01:48:56,400
here in Washington standing went up I

2870
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,960
think that failed

2871
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,460
um but you can see again there's just

2872
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:00,300
like

2873
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:02,340
that question seems to be answered the

2874
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:03,960
Spectrum question it's

2875
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,760
um and it's no longer a Blocker in the

2876
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,920
way that it used to be yeah and some

2877
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,080
people had said that the Navy if the

2878
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,460
Navy needed to use the Spectrum while

2879
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:12,840
you're in it that was that was the

2880
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:14,760
blocker I'm like you know the Navy's

2881
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:16,199
sorting it out

2882
01:49:16,199 --> 01:49:18,420
um okay Tim you had a something you put

2883
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,520
in the chat you'd like to ask a question

2884
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:23,159
yeah thanks so much Curtis I'm really

2885
01:49:23,159 --> 01:49:24,659
intrigued if you've got anything in

2886
01:49:24,659 --> 01:49:27,600
terms of a solution monitoring across

2887
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,960
different networks so that you know

2888
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:32,580
uptime on the different networks that

2889
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:35,040
you're you're dealing with and and

2890
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,260
especially because everybody uses the

2891
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:39,139
same IP address

2892
01:49:39,139 --> 01:49:42,060
you know conflicting of IP addresses

2893
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:43,380
that across like whether you've got

2894
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:46,500
anything that can can go go across

2895
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:49,320
networks in terms of monitoring up time

2896
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:51,540
yeah so we don't have everyone using the

2897
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:53,880
same IP address I think we're actually

2898
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:57,119
natting behind a VPN so basically all

2899
01:49:57,119 --> 01:50:00,960
VPN to our uh like we're an actual ISP

2900
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,639
we have an as and all that kind of stuff

2901
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:05,280
and that's so um I think we VPN

2902
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,159
everything back to our egress and run a

2903
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:10,860
DHCP server there get everyone IP blocks

2904
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:12,900
it's not super elegant we're trying to

2905
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:15,719
find a set of ipv4 blocks

2906
01:50:15,719 --> 01:50:19,020
um because of this uh but uh so we're

2907
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:20,280
able to dock that and in terms of

2908
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,600
monitoring

2909
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,760
um if you go to the scn website I think

2910
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,199
we may have broken it recently actually

2911
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:28,320
but you can see like some Spectrum maps

2912
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,520
and

2913
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,500
um performance measurements there so

2914
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,000
there's just a client that runs on each

2915
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,679
of the boxes and provides some very

2916
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:37,320
simplistic measurements at the moment

2917
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:39,119
um there's a bunch of open questions as

2918
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:42,659
to measuring uh these kind of networks

2919
01:50:42,659 --> 01:50:45,239
versus like the vast majority of

2920
01:50:45,239 --> 01:50:48,300
measurement infrastructure uh is not for

2921
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:51,900
selling networks which ostensibly it

2922
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:54,300
shouldn't be that different but there's

2923
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:57,060
a lot of scheduling and front-end stuff

2924
01:50:57,060 --> 01:51:00,060
that happens in LTE that's much more

2925
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:02,940
complex than like a Wi-Fi network I

2926
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:04,380
think again the speaker for Mission

2927
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:05,940
ahead and Michigan had a great

2928
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:08,219
perspective of like the slowest pieces

2929
01:51:08,219 --> 01:51:10,020
is for them at the client and that's

2930
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:12,000
often not the case

2931
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,400
um exactly uh in the same way because

2932
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:15,840
there's I don't know there's just a lot

2933
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:18,600
more like the the right way like the

2934
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:21,239
Spectrum sharing of a cellular

2935
01:51:21,239 --> 01:51:24,360
system is just complicated in a way that

2936
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:26,820
like Wi-Fi doesn't do uh or I guess most

2937
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:28,199
Wi-Fi doesn't do if you go to some like

2938
01:51:28,199 --> 01:51:29,639
real Cutting Edge standards they do a

2939
01:51:29,639 --> 01:51:31,619
little bit more of it uh point being

2940
01:51:31,619 --> 01:51:33,360
um we just we have a fairly naive

2941
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,980
measurement thing it's mostly measuring

2942
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:36,659
From the Block box out of the network we

2943
01:51:36,659 --> 01:51:37,920
don't have much of the front end a bit

2944
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:38,880
of the measurement which is where I

2945
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,980
think we actually need it client-side

2946
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:43,080
stuff we're building some of that we've

2947
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:45,119
got some like Raspberry Pi kind of like

2948
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:47,580
put it uh as a user on the network and

2949
01:51:47,580 --> 01:51:49,619
measure client performance stuff

2950
01:51:49,619 --> 01:51:51,659
um but again it's a little it's a little

2951
01:51:51,659 --> 01:51:53,580
complicated so uh I don't think that's a

2952
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:55,800
terribly great answer to your question

2953
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:58,699
but that's what we've got

2954
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:01,980
it's a sort of great answer to know that

2955
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:04,639
you're facing the same problem

2956
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:06,560
that's hard

2957
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:10,580
yeah cool thanks

2958
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:14,480
all right any other questions for Curtis

2959
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:17,400
the slides are up on the data tracker

2960
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:20,100
for anyone to take a look at and we'll

2961
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:22,139
be um sending a note out on the Gaia

2962
01:52:22,139 --> 01:52:23,820
list

2963
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:27,060
but we've got about six more minutes or

2964
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,460
we can give people time back and I think

2965
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:31,080
Curtis and I will be putting out a note

2966
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:32,520
early for

2967
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,639
um presentations for the next ietf in

2968
01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:37,820
Japan

2969
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:40,980
