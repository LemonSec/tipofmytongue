you cannot see it it's here it's okay

5
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,840
thank you

6
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,400
you don't see it

7
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,979
foreign

8
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,499
[Music]

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,810
[Music]

10
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,080
on site uh with me just at my left this

11
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,360
is a Jefferson company who is Secretary

12
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,819
of the group as well

13
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,060
um so let's start the meeting and with

14
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,640
the uh first of all

15
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,680
of course the uh not very intellectual

16
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,879
property

17
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,660
so uh you must know that the area

18
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,400
follows the ITF intellectual property

19
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,980
right let's discuss your rules so you

20
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,900
can here read the different rules

21
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,019
which is important to note that if some

22
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,019
contribution you would like to share

23
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:48,540
that are that are covered by your patent

24
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,459
or application now patent you should

25
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,700
disclose it before in a timely manner

26
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,739
of course here you have the reference

27
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,620
document so I invite you to to have a

28
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,400
look

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,480
if needed

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,019
so important information regarding audio

31
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,800
and video recording so as you you may

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,840
notice there will be a recording which

33
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,819
will be done that includes the audio

34
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,760
video and photographs and those will be

35
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,299
published online

36
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,379
um of course you can you can have this

37
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,819
uh

38
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,819
um red to network like landyard uh so if

39
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,560
you do not wear it you can send to our

40
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,620
prayer in Social coding and of course if

41
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,080
you speak in a microphone or if you

42
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,940
even online or if you put your video

43
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,459
online or either on site online you're

44
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,099
speaking microphone you are concerned to

45
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,840
be recorded

46
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,360
so this is very important so if you're

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
online and don't want to consult you

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,420
must turn off your camera and microphone

49
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,819
basically

50
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,659
huh

51
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,099
so

52
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,099
um

53
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,580
although here you have some other

54
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,519
reference reference in particular that

55
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,079
personal information that you provide

56
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,760
for your tfvb undertone connects with

57
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,100
the Privacy policies that is shared with

58
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,720
you here

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,699
as a participant I'll tell you I'll be

60
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,080
to work respectfully with other

61
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,660
participants and so please contact the

62
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,180
ambulance team uh with the link here if

63
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,919
you have a question or concern about it

64
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,560
and we recommend and we ask you to look

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,840
at the RFC

66
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,979
um 71 54 and RFC

67
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,600
7776 uh

68
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,860
which also applied to irgf

69
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,820
just as a reminder about the goals of

70
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,280
your HF iotf conducts research it's not

71
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,500
in standard development organization

72
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,139
so the iot focus is a longer term

73
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,880
research

74
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,600
um

75
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,639
yeah issue it to the internet while the

76
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,740
parallel organization the ATF focuses on

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,139
short-term issues of engineering and

78
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,820
standard making

79
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,979
why the artificial informational or

80
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,139
expansion experimental documents in

81
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,940
geography series is primary goal is to

82
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,080
promote development of research

83
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,180
collaboration and teamwork and spring

84
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,160
research security to internet protocols

85
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,540
application architecture and Technology

86
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,940
another area of the RFC 74 are 18 to

87
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,139
that refers to that

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,500
here is a link for the uh for the first

89
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,720
meeting what is important and what is I

90
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,520
think written the slide is that even if

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,259
you're on site is importance that you

92
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,120
connect to mythical because this will be

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,460
uh necessary to collect the blue sheet

94
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,979
it will be done by this way

95
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,539
um so very important that you collectors

96
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,820
automatico is not done yet

97
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,759
you have here the link for notes

98
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,639
um so that will be also used afterward

99
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,759
meeting to also create the minutes

100
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,560
and of course all materials are online

101
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,100
as well

102
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,600
so let's move on now more to the content

103
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,220
of the meeting so we'll be there will be

104
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,440
a brief introduction here regarding the

105
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,120
searches of the group

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,479
so uh

107
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,919
from the last meeting that we have

108
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,039
declared are the two I receive that was

109
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,199
in the queue regarding IBM that have

110
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,440
been published so the first one which is

111
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,979
RFC 9315 about Indian Bay networking

112
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,400
concept and definition and rrc 93 16

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,599
with intent classification

114
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,180
um although there is there is one active

115
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,740
research group document which is our

116
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,660
digital Network concept and reference

117
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,259
architecture

118
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,819
um or those are the bunch of documents

119
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,160
which are run in the group for let's say

120
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,319
for a while quite stable and maybe there

121
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,100
will be uh for some of them for one of

122
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,419
them there has been a call for adoption

123
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:07,080
before but we think as also as as the

124
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,180
chairs of the group that there will be

125
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,919
potential upcoming call for Redemption

126
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,020
for this document is still here the

127
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,280
first one about Network measurement

128
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,740
interns around about IDF Network size

129
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,199
intent and the last one about

130
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,340
interconnection intents

131
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,440
the question also because this documents

132
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,940
these documents will be presented today

133
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,979
the question will be all with the

134
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,699
evolved towards are having this document

135
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,699
and adopted and maybe and then uh to to

136
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,979
propose you for possible publication as

137
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,080
races to have a singular multiple use

138
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,460
case documents this question is still

139
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,660
open

140
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,639
and although there are documents that

141
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,979
are possible coming references will be

142
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,180
about the research challenges in

143
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,440
artificial intelligence for Network

144
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,940
management so we'll be under the

145
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,900
presented today as well

146
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,560
uh although we would like to

147
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,180
um

148
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,880
also like to to share with you the uh

149
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,400
maybe the to recall the research agenda

150
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,500
of an emergency that you can also find

151
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,319
on the data tracker

152
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,000
one major Rock item of the group was

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,360
related to IBM uh as you know know we

154
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,220
have as a touristy that has been

155
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,199
published we have the use cases and the

156
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,080
questions that would as a group

157
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,319
if you want to pursue this work on other

158
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,960
uh let's say work items for example

159
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,639
architecture on that it was initially

160
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,979
easy the objectives

161
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,940
uh but after submitting there was no so

162
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,440
much content about that but it's still

163
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,940
open and so we'd like also to have your

164
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,620
feedback with our indict in the

165
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,820
discussion

166
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,458
of course I kind of uh rather a new

167
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,799
topic in the group like the AI Network

168
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,140
and recently more recently green

169
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,540
networking so the it's so also the

170
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,860
question will be

171
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,300
uh

172
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,279
show these different topic continue to

173
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,440
be part of an MLG should be somewhere

174
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,820
else for them

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,260
the right place for this topic or not

176
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,779
for for future works so the questions

177
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,820
that we are currently uh think are

178
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,700
important to ask ourselves as a group as

179
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,880
well

180
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,320
thank you

181
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,160
sorry

182
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,839
and for use the agenda for today uh uh

183
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,839
for uh I'm sorry tradition we will

184
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,480
follow this with let's say four groups

185
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,240
the first one with IBM and the second

186
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,220
language is about AI the foreign

187
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,500
of the end of the meeting

188
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,560
foreign

189
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:50,959
you want to add something from your side

190
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,180
okay nothing to are from Lauren so also

191
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,200
in

192
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,140
if there is no

193
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,640
comment or question I propose that we

194
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,860
move forward so

195
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,740
um I I just request different speaker to

196
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,500
to keep to keep to keep track on time as

197
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,180
well and I will try to use this condom

198
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,060
stuff from The Amity code to help you

199
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,599
so let me ask Luis

200
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,980
start presenting I mean just share the

201
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,279
slide

202
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,360
I think the first one is

203
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,320
Network slice intentions

204
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,620
yeah yeah for speaking

205
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,839
okay just let me know when you want a

206
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,839
yes thank you so hello everyone I will

207
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,079
present one of the the two use cases for

208
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,700
foreign

209
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,680
this one is related to another slice

210
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,819
intent so next please

211
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,339
so as a reminder the idea would be to

212
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,079
leverage

213
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,880
Network Technologies for requesting IDF

214
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,700
number slices so the use case one of one

215
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,860
of them could be the the sonar

216
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,380
persistent is requesting and slice and

217
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,060
it will the IDF let's say capabilities

218
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,579
controller and on this very immediate

219
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,140
use case could be the 3dp management

220
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,240
system for instance we will recommend

221
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,339
later on the idea of a POC on this

222
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,740
respect so essentially through the

223
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,420
intent we will have a declarative

224
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,519
intention of highness size and this

225
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,320
declarative intention will be translated

226
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,380
to what we expect to be translated to a

227
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,779
kind of an MBI that could be supported

228
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,260
by a NSE

229
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,480
controller and so on so far so the

230
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,220
benefits of going in the direction of

231
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,560
Indian base will be the the portability

232
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,720
so we could have a solution that could

233
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
be consumed by different implementations

234
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,519
later on in the control part also simple

235
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
way of expressing transmission size

236
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,860
needs so the clarity wave expressing the

237
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,540
slices

238
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,200
and so and as any kind of internal

239
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,000
system to focus on the world and not on

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,060
how right the Hub will be later on being

241
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,399
decided by the ITF number or less

242
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,800
control in this case so we see this as a

243
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,200
compliment for the this for the working

244
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,440
group sorry for the slice work in this

245
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,779
working group so complementing all that

246
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,579
stuff all those ideas of nevertheless

247
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,140
controller with an intent-based system

248
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,579
on top of that for doing that

249
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,680
translation from the declarative idea of

250
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,620
an intent to apply either a normal

251
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,880
interface of the neighborhood in this

252
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,880
controller so next please

253
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,680
God

254
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,120
so that that's foreign

255
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,160
in the upper part in order to do the an

256
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,800
easy translation from the declarative

257
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,899
slice intent towards the MBA young model

258
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,060
and also we have provided details on the

259
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,180
Assurance phase of the for the internal

260
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,339
life cycle so as you can see there we

261
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,740
were well in in the previous section we

262
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,740
propose the Fulfillment part so we are

263
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,760
here complementing with the Assurance

264
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,000
part we have on the monitoring side the

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,500
collection of monitoring information

266
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,019
related to the slice so whatever is has

267
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,380
to deal with the slos and slice slice

268
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,120
that are respected for the for their

269
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,980
slice

270
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,399
in the media in the middle part we will

271
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,320
have the aggregation of this information

272
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,019
this monitoring data data that could fit

273
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,660
the validate component that will help us

274
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,700
to

275
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,740
to realize the inner closed loop for

276
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,600
controlling the the intent in the

277
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,100
provider side and also on on your left

278
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,620
you can see the the components for a

279
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,720
providing the report to the to the

280
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,480
customer so so how extracting the

281
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,800
monitoring information the monitoring

282
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,959
and Telemetry information in such a way

283
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,940
that the customer can receive feedback

284
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,160
from the behavior of the slides and then

285
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,320
the customer can perform the outer close

286
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,620
loop for yeah for fixing whatever

287
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,600
um problem that could be with the slides

288
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,860
so next please

289
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,240
we are targeting a POC so essentially we

290
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,880
understand we have let's say like five

291
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,060
uh main components to address the first

292
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,560
one will be the translation from this

293
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,760
upper system so take it into

294
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,260
consideration information that could

295
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,320
come for a in this case in the in this

296
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,300
particular example from the 3bp system

297
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,220
so understand the kind of objects that

298
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,459
VPP system can

299
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,380
propose

300
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,940
to the intent-based system so taking

301
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,620
them and translating them this would be

302
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,260
the component one the component two will

303
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,940
be essentially the mapping to the normal

304
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,760
interface of the network size controller

305
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,519
so for that we are also running some

306
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,279
parallel work in this working group we

307
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,380
have the I I have put that a couple of

308
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,959
drafts one the first one in in different

309
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,660
parties essentially or we intend to

310
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,760
describe there the mapping of the

311
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
information from three Epp to what would

312
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,199
be the mbir model and the wall at the

313
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,459
bottom is essentially the realization

314
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,040
with current VIP and TLS Technologies so

315
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,680
the idea is to leverage on those drafts

316
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,300
for let's say accomplishing the

317
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,120
Fulfillment part for the Assurance part

318
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,459
that will correspond to a component

319
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,980
number three we the idea is to leverage

320
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,320
on on some other work in ATF maybe the

321
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,079
the service Assurance architecture that

322
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,680
is being proposed in in noksa also and

323
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,120
then we will have the component 4 and

324
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,620
the component five the component four

325
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,620
sincere will be to report to the um CBB

326
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,740
management system

327
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,300
the behavior of the slides so the

328
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,699
reporting some kpis essentially and the

329
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,440
number five will be the validation of

330
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,540
those kpis for performing the inner

331
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,839
close loop Control Plus Loop so next

332
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,420
please what uh sorry the other the

333
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,579
question I put also this question maybe

334
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,339
for discussion if we should document the

335
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,100
fully the use case in the in the in this

336
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,899
draft or essentially pointing out to

337
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,940
other work in these and so so this is a

338
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,579
question maybe for for discussion next

339
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,800
please

340
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,540
so key questions from the chairs the

341
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,019
chairs propose us to solve to answer a

342
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,279
number of questions so the objective of

343
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,160
the work was one of them so yeah this is

344
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,980
clear the Our intention is to elaborate

345
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,820
intents that could facilitate the

346
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,980
request of ITF Network slices

347
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,019
uh so complementing therefore in this

348
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,139
working group and defining a suitable

349
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,019
internet-based system for consuming ITF

350
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,180
number slices

351
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,579
remaining steps to finalize

352
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,380
um essentially we need to propose a

353
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,319
structure to express the IDF networks

354
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,419
live service and validate them and ideas

355
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,819
to validate through the POC and taking

356
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,559
as an example the 3dp which is the

357
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,880
normal material

358
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,400
and how long this would take for ideas

359
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,660
to

360
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,299
to do this proof of concept for the

361
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,980
Fulfillment phase the component number

362
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,140
one that was on the right before

363
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,040
targeting April 23 hopefully maybe the

364
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,240
the its 116 but probably too soon so

365
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,220
um will be probably more in between if

366
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,799
we have a kind of interim meeting or so

367
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,840
and and then the idea will be to start

368
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,400
working on the student phase probably

369
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,860
with a basic approach no not very much

370
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,620
sophisticated and maybe targeting the

371
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,820
latest idea meeting next year at 118.

372
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,799
with that we would have the ultra closed

373
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,600
loop more or less or some kind of proof

374
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,240
of concept in that respect and yeah

375
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,100
trying to work on the component five uh

376
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,419
this is for further analysis probably we

377
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:01,860
need more capabilities maybe the

378
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,480
enormous artificial intelligence I don't

379
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,700
know we need more time for for analyzing

380
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,480
that

381
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,840
so next please and this is the the final

382
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,980
one

383
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,980
so yeah we we need to define the

384
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,720
structure of the ideal Network size

385
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,000
intent template and how to do this

386
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,940
declarative approach and and then

387
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,260
address the Fulfillment phase

388
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,240
collaborating on translation approaches

389
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,740
and interaction with the upper systems

390
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,480
and guess we're on Facebook exploring

391
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,539
the monitoring Telemetry all the data

392
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,340
that could enable the interaction with

393
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,919
the customer and the controllers loops

394
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,100
and that's all from us I think

395
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,059
thank you Luis

396
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,039
is the question online

397
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,220
so there is a question online uh once I

398
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,919
try is tagging an intent as SLO or SLE

399
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,559
part of the intent formulation itself or

400
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,720
is it part of the transaction process

401
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,480
on site three is tagging an intent as

402
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
SLR SLE part of the intent formulation

403
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,280
itself or is it part of the translation

404
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,860
process there's a lowest level be part

405
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,720
of the translation process because

406
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,299
could be the case I mean what what the

407
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,480
network will be able to manage our slos

408
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,780
related to the network but we are not so

409
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,880
sure what could be the the kind of I

410
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,559
mean the sellers from the perspective of

411
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,600
the customer if we take the three Epp

412
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,179
example probably could be similar we we

413
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,600
could be talking about uh net worth loss

414
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,400
in every case in the customer side and

415
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,380
in the record in the provider side but

416
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,140
in general cases could be the the

417
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,940
situation that the customer expresses a

418
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,860
lot related to the service so how we

419
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,559
need to translate this service slos to

420
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,900
network slos

421
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,620
okay okay thank you

422
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,459
yes hello

423
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,360
um so I think this is a very nice use

424
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,120
it's a very very nice topic but I do

425
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,700
have one question concerning nmrg versus

426
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,340
standardization uh so the question is

427
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,559
busy how much do you think is a research

428
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,020
type of agenda versus how much might be

429
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,520
ready for civilization you're talking

430
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,360
about but it would be an IDF as well can

431
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,100
you perhaps common

432
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,320
thanks for for the question

433
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,780
certainly

434
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,919
there will be aspect more related to

435
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,299
research for instance all the control

436
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,580
loops this is probably more more focused

437
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,980
on research the pure translation itself

438
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,440
is maybe it's not there is not so much

439
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,059
research in that respect maybe there

440
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,980
could be areas we commenting the class

441
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,080
now the translation from services and

442
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,780
laws to network slos so some ideas of

443
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,539
how how to digest let's say the service

444
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,000
Expressions to relate to transform to

445
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,919
network Expressions maybe that could be

446
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,559
much more related to to research the

447
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,720
pure translation itself probably is not

448
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,799
not

449
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,780
not research at all

450
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,260
thanks

451
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,240
I think online Laura has a question

452
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,000
let's say TMF intent model or intent API

453
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,960
or bio planning to start from scratch

454
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,120
well

455
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,340
how is to offer the intent in a general

456
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,100
manners the relation with TM Forum run

457
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,940
and some other apis on top is not I mean

458
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,640
probably could be even on top of the

459
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,080
upper system that will request an

460
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,720
average lies so maybe not data it could

461
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,980
be that there is no direct relation

462
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,740
between the TM for an apis and the idea

463
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,740
of memorized stuff

464
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,440
so that's how we the idea is to to offer

465
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,940
a mechanism for just translation that

466
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,159
could be consumed maybe for the TM Forum

467
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,840
for some kind of component between the

468
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,179
TM from API and the idea of networkless

469
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,600
controller

470
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,820
okay so thank you it's I think if there

471
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,200
is no other question there are some

472
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
audio issues so before we take offline

473
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,059
the question so we can move to the cures

474
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,480
our presentation

475
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,879
foreign

476
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,460
okay so the second case is about

477
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,820
interconnection so next slide please

478
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,620
there as a reminder of the motivation

479
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,720
and the objectives the ideas that were

480
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,120
so how we we are now environment

481
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,440
transitioning from the classical

482
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,000
internal collection which is simply The

483
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,799
Interchange of Ip traffic to something

484
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,500
much more sophisticated which requires

485
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,960
to to provide I mean to request

486
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,159
capabilities related to service

487
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,380
functions to a

488
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,679
Network or Computer Resources so moving

489
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,080
from the simply interchange of Ip

490
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,919
traffic

491
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,380
so a part of Ip prefixes so the idea

492
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,179
would be to Interchange or to request in

493
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,120
that interconnection intent service

494
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,400
functions and of course Computer

495
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Resources memory CPUs or quotas or

496
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,780
whatever so next please

497
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,080
was a reminder so the idea is to

498
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,120
leverage on internet-based Technologies

499
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,679
for handle this enrich interconnection

500
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,500
as analysis of applicability we listed

501
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,480
there a number of them that could be

502
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,220
others for sure could be the

503
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,780
interconnection of non-public Network to

504
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,240
public networks in 5G or multi-domain

505
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,240
level as a service request as in section

506
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,440
4.4 of RFC 85688 or multi-domain network

507
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,539
virtualization like in the data I

508
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,280
reference there there could be others as

509
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,460
well for sure so the modes of usage of

510
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,320
this interconnection intent we can just

511
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,539
simply stay with a IP traffic

512
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,820
integration I mean the the Classical

513
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,559
period and Transit the business as usual

514
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,960
but we can go further probably

515
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,559
requesting Services

516
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,120
CDN interconnection as defined in a

517
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,700
variety of cdni or a virtual Network

518
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,580
functional as a service so for instance

519
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,720
requesting packet core Network

520
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,400
capabilities for mobile network

521
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,600
operators or compute capabilities has we

522
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,360
propose as well in other tasks from this

523
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,159
working group or any combination of all

524
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,140
of them so essentially

525
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,480
asset moving from the classical IP

526
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,740
Interchange to something much more

527
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,960
sophisticated the benefits as before

528
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,299
will be to establish a common anomalized

529
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,220
way of doing this and reach in the

530
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,900
connections and a simple way of

531
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,840
expressing them and also having

532
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,480
portability let's say between

533
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,280
implementation later on in the control

534
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,960
part so next please

535
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,460
the updates from the previous version we

536
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,159
have have added a deterioration phase as

537
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,440
was presented before in the case of

538
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,299
um slicing I will present it in excess

539
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,220
light and also we introduce his own

540
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,220
insights on interconditional structure

541
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,780
so information that about the type of

542
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,580
data traffic to be interchange service

543
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,200
functions expected to be supported by

544
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,419
the build provider resources expected to

545
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,520
be offered by the P provider constraints

546
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,140
that could apply to the traffic studying

547
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,640
or to the resources that we are

548
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,679
requesting to the other provider or in

549
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,059
even the the uh the chain between the

550
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,620
functions that we expect to be

551
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,700
accomplished in the in the other

552
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,200
provider

553
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,419
um whatever additional information that

554
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,159
could be necessary for delivering an

555
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,200
end-to-end service in the other provider

556
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,159
side

557
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,320
so next please

558
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,080
this reflects the the detail of their

559
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,820
surround phase as before we would have

560
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,700
depart here on on your right for

561
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,260
monitoring and collecting the Telemetry

562
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,360
data then in the middle the idea of

563
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,159
checking that data for either validating

564
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,679
and Performing the closed control Loop

565
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,320
internal to the provider B in this case

566
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,419
to the provider that is feeding with the

567
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,880
pre-coaster and also we will have on

568
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,520
your left the capabilities for reporting

569
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,159
analyzing analyzing the metrics of the

570
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,059
interconnection and reach

571
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,320
interconnection and then triggering

572
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,419
action corrective actions in needed that

573
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,539
would implement the outer control cross

574
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,980
Loop in this case

575
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,679
so next please

576
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,320
the key questions that were asked by the

577
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,539
by the chairs so the objective will be

578
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,400
to elaborate this intense to facilitate

579
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,480
new interconnectional needs

580
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,340
sophisticated needs service functions

581
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,520
resources and so

582
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,740
um the remaining steps for for

583
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,360
finalizing this that we have a b to

584
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,220
propose a structure for the intent and

585
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,159
then to validate it through a POC and

586
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,919
regarding how long this could take we

587
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,820
could foresee a POC targeting the latest

588
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,760
Ikea meeting next year and maybe it

589
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,260
could be even a potential topic for a

590
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,880
hackathon at that time because whatever

591
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,919
has to deal with interconnection has

592
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,260
with interoperability so it could be

593
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,760
maybe a very good topic for having

594
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,580
interpretability in in the hackathon

595
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,120
uh in iti118 so next please

596
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:08,220
yeah for moving forward they drive ideas

597
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,020
the idea will be to define a more detail

598
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,640
the structure of the intent that the

599
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,520
template the model the the to model

600
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,380
let's say the audio the objects for

601
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,600
interchange between the peers and to

602
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,820
identify protocols or apis or the lack

603
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,559
of them for accomplishing the different

604
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,419
kind of interconnection types considered

605
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:25,919
so not only happy Traffic Service

606
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,200
function resources and so on so far so

607
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,640
the feedback is more than welcome for

608
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,340
sure and there is just one reminder in

609
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,860
this life Jerome

610
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,960
because this is a question for the

611
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,700
research group we have been in contact

612
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,440
with the authors of the measurement

613
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,659
intent with colleagues that will talk

614
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,880
after me and and we have common

615
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,220
interests in in the in the drugs of each

616
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,140
other so we have two options for

617
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,299
progressing the work either combining

618
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,580
the two documents or even uh I mean the

619
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,440
office of each document during the the

620
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,120
other document so this is a question for

621
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,039
for you the chairs and for the rocket

622
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,260
research group what could be the best

623
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,020
way to follow okay and that's all for my

624
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,419
side thank you

625
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,380
thank you Luis

626
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,200
hello

627
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,460
in this uh

628
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,159
is the provider Network and client

629
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,080
Network interconnection also part of

630
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,720
this or is it only related to a

631
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,580
multi-domain provider provider Network

632
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,860
interconnection the real idea was the

633
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,260
amount of mine provided to provider but

634
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,059
could be probably easily standard

635
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,100
extendable to the client to provide them

636
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,440
they do not foresee any

637
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,240
problem in that respect but the original

638
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,059
idea is provided to provider why I bring

639
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,340
this up is during the ITF Network slides

640
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,559
discussion there were this talk also

641
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,840
about like you know I might need to

642
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,120
create more logical interfaces as I move

643
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,179
things and I would like to do it in a

644
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:55,500
much simpler way

645
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,240
so I think the what you're proposing

646
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,400
here could be used even for doing that

647
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,140
so it might be worth expanding it a

648
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,480
little bit and including that as well

649
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,640
okay thanks thank you

650
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,580
you can ask a question

651
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,080
it was already done

652
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,679
oh I think he left the queue

653
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,720
sorry what was the rule oh okay I'm

654
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,899
sorry

655
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,220
you didn't get the name uh so for maybe

656
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,440
as a maybe as a terrible question I

657
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,880
think are the two options that you are

658
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
mentioning

659
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,700
uh I think the it's hard to just to give

660
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,559
you uh an answer like that maybe it

661
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,000
should be good that he's user will tell

662
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,440
you sure what are the common part maybe

663
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
in another meeting what should be merged

664
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,640
and what should be in commands to to

665
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,159
figure out what exactly what would be

666
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,580
the mirror okay because it would be

667
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,559
I think in general I would say it's if

668
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,880
there is a lot of community it's good to

669
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,100
merge

670
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
if not uh maybe not that we should see

671
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,620
because it's for me at least uh it's

672
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,240
this would be hard to take a decision

673
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,840
just by these two questions okay okay

674
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,320
thank you

675
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,380
okay thank you okay thank you Luis so

676
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,220
let's move on to the next presentation

677
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,039
I think next speaker is Dan yang

678
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,480
hi chair uh can you hear my voice oh

679
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,220
okay you represent okay I will just show

680
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,120
the slide and then

681
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,880
okay

682
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,080
um hello everyone I am currently from

683
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,500
China mobile and uh um this time I'll

684
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,679
present about uh Ami uh Network

685
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,380
environment intent so two working items

686
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,340
uh

687
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,340
um have been published as 5Cs namely the

688
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,159
concepts and definition of IBM

689
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,440
classification of IBM so I think in The

690
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,419
Next Step there is a main focus on

691
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,520
studying the use case of IBN what

692
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,679
exactly IBN can bring in what kind of

693
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,200
season rails so that's basically why we

694
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,320
propose a typical use case of IBM

695
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,539
Network management intent which we think

696
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,820
is a very important and practical use

697
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,179
case of IBM and uh after several updates

698
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,980
of the draft we have received very

699
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,500
valuable suggestions from juices and

700
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,360
chain from Huawei and Lewis from

701
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,120
telefonka and we all think that Airline

702
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,880
is well worthy of studying in Mig and we

703
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,919
are keeping for looking forward to more

704
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:51,659
suggestions so next slide please

705
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,720
so here is a very brave recap of the

706
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,899
draft in the recent update so the

707
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:01,380
introduction about nmi Ami is to use a

708
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,559
network measurement intent to achieve a

709
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,539
network performance aggregation and from

710
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,659
user or network administrator intent to

711
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,820
verify whether a network measurement

712
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,880
result meet the environment content and

713
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,159
further improve the equity of the

714
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,679
configuration in the network so and this

715
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,320
time we have uh

716
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,500
make a update

717
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,080
of the relationship with two offices

718
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,380
that is the concepts and and definition

719
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,640
of IBN and the classification of IBM so

720
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,240
uh next slide please

721
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,779
and in our proposal we further divide

722
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,240
Ami to different subgroups and from

723
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,580
different angles and in concrete

724
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,700
examples we live we have listed about

725
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,179
time time accuracy environment uh which

726
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,539
is use um missions to uh which is about

727
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,059
how to balance and accurately marry the

728
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,899
network state from the time scale and uh

729
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,440
and we also list about the use case of

730
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,840
spatial accuracy environment that is to

731
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,419
marry the network state but at the same

732
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:16,080
time to to take care of the network

733
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,019
resources

734
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:24,299
to read to reduce as more uh as much as

735
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,620
possible the resource to be employed

736
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,019
in the network that is achieved well

737
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,000
meantime at the meantime to achieve the

738
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,059
desired accuracy and also we have uh

739
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,940
this is the classification of nmi that

740
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,919
is a static in my and the dynamic Mi

741
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:46,559
so it's static Mi is about the the

742
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,899
measurement purposes remain unchanged

743
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,820
and it's independent in the network

744
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,679
State about Dynamic Mi is

745
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,320
it uh changes dynamically according to

746
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,559
the network State environment so these

747
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:05,039
These Are The Brave recap of the draft

748
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,740
and the recent updates so next time at

749
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,860
least

750
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,580
so after uh the last time the calling

751
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,980
for adoption procedure we have received

752
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,960
about total of nine members from

753
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,580
different entities to support the draft

754
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,099
we have solved questions raising the

755
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,980
main release and we have updated uh the

756
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,619
references of other offices and the

757
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,260
working group documents and the next

758
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,679
slide please

759
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,260
so for the next step just like Luis

760
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,418
mentioned in his draft interconnection

761
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,639
intent so different

762
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,040
um personal drafts focused on IBM use

763
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,099
cases have been proposed to nmrg we can

764
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,320
either merge them into a whole working

765
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,899
group document of IBM use case

766
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,780
alternatively we can update separately

767
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,900
and join each other so and this time we

768
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,420
we still hope to receive comments on

769
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,000
this route from audience and chairs and

770
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,920
we hope to push forward on the study of

771
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,099
IBM use case so thank you very much

772
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:11,119
looking for cause questions

773
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,180
thank you so any question from the

774
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,540
audience

775
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,180
okay so so maybe for

776
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,060
um again this is a a bit similar that

777
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,619
the the question before about the the

778
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:36,480
emerging at work if I think if I am if

779
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,980
I'm interested in a while

780
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,579
uh you you are there is as I said in the

781
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,320
introduction this option for emerging

782
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,720
type one single document for all living

783
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,540
use case or not

784
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,280
um I think maybe it's a Jefferson you

785
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,720
can you can pick a little bit I think

786
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,920
they're easy

787
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,760
this is uh still open the main the main

788
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,920
let's say concern will be that to

789
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,660
identify command structure and template

790
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,940
I think Jefferson started to do so and

791
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,700
then a bit of the question to um to

792
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,980
those to all this author working and use

793
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,440
case the community this structure is

794
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,380
okay you are who they would like to to

795
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,200
change it or maybe they see that it will

796
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,060
not possible to have a common use case

797
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,579
like a common document it will be just

798
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,540
adjust let's say you um a sequence of a

799
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,099
documents documents that will be not

800
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,920
good so I think it's very important to

801
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,140
um of course to identify what will be

802
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,980
the

803
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,780
the structure of such a document before

804
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,940
saying that yes we need a single single

805
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,400
document on it I don't know if you want

806
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,940
to add something

807
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,400
you know what I think that maybe if

808
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,400
um because we we had this this template

809
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,859
for for the document so if the authors

810
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,619
of the these drafts can you know address

811
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:56,579
that like saying that it's okay or you

812
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,160
can maybe change the template it would

813
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,220
be nice otherwise in the the next

814
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,440
meetings we can have presentations

815
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,960
pointing out the the similarities you

816
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,540
know like to to show if it's it's

817
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,720
possible at least because I think it I

818
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,940
also agree it would be better to have a

819
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,700
just one document but uh we will have to

820
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,599
see if it's possible

821
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,900
30 percent

822
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,119
yeah I think you're a cat and so we will

823
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,560
continue with the next presentation

824
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,160
so that will be given by myself

825
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,420
so just ask you to change the slider

826
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:51,839
[Music]

827
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,839
um

828
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,040
just

829
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,900
okay so

830
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,940
um so I'm John Francis so this is a

831
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,619
shorter data with the the slide

832
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,420
regarding research energies in coping

833
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,560
artificial intelligence and network

834
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,920
management

835
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,160
uh Sawyers again just a summary of um

836
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,800
have the outline of the draft so maybe

837
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,060
just as a

838
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,820
as a remaining disease so the second

839
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,800
version but of course if you remember if

840
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,119
you're participating to the to the group

841
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,619
you find the discussion we have this

842
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,680
share document that you work on before

843
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,140
it was in in the in the format of the

844
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,400
draft

845
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,280
uh so here's the current uh let's say

846
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,980
um outline and uh just this was a

847
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,780
reminder so I've

848
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,720
basically three main categories to

849
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,040
classify the challenge we have

850
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,140
challenges relating to the AI technique

851
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,420
for Network management well once which

852
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,240
G6 and six six and three section 7 is

853
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,180
about the network data it's a common

854
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,859
problems that you have and you want to

855
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,300
use AI

856
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,920
Section 8 is more about the

857
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,500
acceptability of AI itself when we apply

858
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,540
to our domain Network management next

859
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,640
slide please

860
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,099
so from uh from last time we received a

861
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,980
few comments so uh so we basically

862
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,079
change the document according to them we

863
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,060
agree

864
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,820
we uh complete the document to cover

865
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,280
some issues or some Concepts that were

866
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,780
not covered well

867
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,660
uh in particular we refer to the data

868
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,440
mesh concept I think other than the

869
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,960
I need the concept which it was very uh

870
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,480
interesting to highlight here is

871
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,060
that in the previous version realized

872
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,079
that there are a different granularity

873
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,940
of datas or a different volumetry

874
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,200
different

875
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,480
uh it's a dynamically change the data

876
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,180
that come at different time and so on uh

877
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,560
one important thing that we did not

878
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,900
really highlight is that okay there are

879
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,280
different type of database they are

880
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,339
natural by the way they are provided but

881
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:57,839
when you have to aggregate this data as

882
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,640
I might not be aligned in terms of time

883
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,700
as well and this can this can also raise

884
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,619
some issue and challenges so it's not

885
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:07,280
just only via real-time data or we have

886
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,440
data that arrives very fastly some can

887
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,480
be very fast or not and so sometimes we

888
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,180
need to still align them

889
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,060
next slide please

890
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,400
uh so for the next step what we would

891
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,619
like to uh to have of course I have more

892
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:25,200
feedback from the group and also maybe I

893
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,480
have a conversation that we'd like to

894
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,359
ask for this in the uh in the next and

895
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,680
the next step

896
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,420
we have already identified possible

897
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,220
addition we don't know if we need to

898
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,960
include already then or if you need to

899
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,599
include uh at all regarding lightweight

900
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,520
yeah within distributed AI is not well

901
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,960
integrated though

902
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,940
there is some discussion about the

903
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,619
impact of level versus unlably data also

904
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:51,300
some discussion I mean internally

905
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,060
between the let's say the the group of

906
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,820
water but having some more content about

907
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,180
as a legal or regulatory product of

908
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,099
let's say using AI for Network

909
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:03,599
management

910
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,099
what do you think is that we cannot be

911
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,680
exhaustive anyway so we try to figure

912
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,180
out what would be the most valuable

913
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,099
challenges for the group in the

914
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,260
documents that we put of course all your

915
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,020
feedback is welcome to be sure that not

916
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,339
that we are not validating something

917
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:18,960
because I think it would be very hard to

918
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,480
be any way to be exhaustive and might

919
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,820
not be the call here

920
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,400
and also an additional Next Step will be

921
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,920
that know that we are this document that

922
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,200
is we think that is quite stable so

923
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,579
let's see what is your feedback as well

924
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:33,560
of course

925
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,420
uh what would be the role as I also as I

926
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,619
share as I said that you will be the

927
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:38,880
role of the group regarding the

928
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,220
different challenges okay so maybe we

929
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,780
are happy we have a nice document that

930
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,359
you can refer in different uh

931
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,780
papers or other threats and so would be

932
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,060
also the objective as a group to more

933
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,560
deeply investigate some of these

934
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,780
challenges by providing some solution

935
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,820
uh maybe not not all probably because

936
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,280
there are two too many

937
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,500
uh or do we try to maybe simply try not

938
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,300
if we are not let's say a providing

939
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,520
solution try maybe maybe another

940
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,480
possible approach will be try to

941
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,540
um try to identify and maybe some kind

942
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,980
of please what has been proposed in

943
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,780
nature Returns on to solve these

944
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,880
challenges at least partially to just

945
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,099
also other than just purely we have

946
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,359
already references of friends and around

947
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,060
but rather than purely uh just the the

948
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,619
challenges maybe some kind of let's see

949
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,140
living uh document where we say okay

950
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,420
there is new Solutions that's been

951
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,420
proposed uh I don't know here or in this

952
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,220
conference or by this tool and so on so

953
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,619
that can fulfill the challenge and

954
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,380
can be also a goal of uh of the group to

955
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,900
maintain this as well uh of course maybe

956
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,200
in some some more uh let's say uh Drive

957
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,400
which are more focused and certain

958
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,619
Challenge and I suppose then we have a

959
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:50,940
presentation

960
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,000
uh about that

961
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,940
and that's all for me so

962
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,619
um if you have any question or comment

963
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,420
it's wrong

964
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:20,400
are you we're waiting for following I

965
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,440
think

966
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,640
so but but maybe ask you a question okay

967
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,740
I think yes maybe some audio issues

968
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,240
still

969
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,180
well I I forgot to kick the to click the

970
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,060
the button this is a developer

971
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,280
um it's when you're talking about the

972
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,800
data challenges Etc

973
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,319
I I there

974
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,420
I miss a couple of things one is the

975
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,839
suitability of uh

976
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:47,819
unsupervised environmenting in networks

977
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,680
because of the stability concerns

978
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,720
another like this is one thing

979
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,180
the second and I believe is something

980
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,339
that is critical in the application

981
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,619
available to networks is precisely

982
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:02,339
distributed AI or not only the Federated

983
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,099
models but anything that is implied by

984
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,099
the uh using localized Ai and knowledge

985
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:10,319
sharing just if you want to add a few

986
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,140
other other subsections to the to the

987
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,339
document

988
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:15,480
yes

989
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,980
so yeah I think this would be important

990
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,660
to have it as well right this is

991
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,579
we think so that maybe what was missing

992
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:34,200
at least maybe in the group of photos

993
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,300
somebody that is very let's say this

994
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,400
treaty that what Jesus so let's say uh

995
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,980
let's say 2012 is a Federated AI

996
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,260
you are looking for some help so if in

997
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,380
either room is volunteer to help us for

998
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,940
this part in the document will be very

999
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,540
happy to have it I I think I think I

1000
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,880
could I could try to to make something

1001
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,119
if you if you don't mind because we were

1002
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,980
yes we try to figure out who could

1003
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,220
contribute with uh right okay

1004
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,560
I'll try to prepare something and share

1005
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,460
with you thank you

1006
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,839
[Music]

1007
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:16,079
I think uh Lohan is on the the Kiwi but

1008
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,480
you know

1009
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,040
can you can speak

1010
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,359
okay okay

1011
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,400
maybe put on the chat

1012
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,460
I hope we can we can procure your

1013
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,400
question to your home if you write on

1014
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,700
the chat

1015
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,220
so let's continue

1016
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,319
yeah yeah oh yes I keep mine

1017
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,960
sure

1018
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,440
all right

1019
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,000
okay good morning my name is

1020
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,819
University in South Korea this is the

1021
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,220
internet or the title is consideration

1022
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,260
over deploying a services in a

1023
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,060
distributed approaches

1024
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,099
next please

1025
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,900
okay this is the second version and

1026
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,240
second presentation okay next piece

1027
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,680
this is update after last meeting so we

1028
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,380
reconfigured the section four the sixth

1029
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,260
Port title is consideration or complete

1030
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,599
building or system to provide AI

1031
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,920
services so uh because we found on one

1032
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,040
the relevant or reference that is the

1033
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,700
etsi document So based on the idea we

1034
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,760
support divide the section 4 to section

1035
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,619
4.1 section 4.2 and the section 4.3 the

1036
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:19,619
section 4.1 is to order functional

1037
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:21,839
characteristic of the hardware and

1038
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,200
section 4.2 is the characteristic of the

1039
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,440
air model and sections 4.3 is the

1040
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,599
characteristic of the communication

1041
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:34,500
method and we add one reference that is

1042
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,200
the etsa document the title is overlay

1043
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,960
Computing Market acceleration me

1044
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,359
symmetrics best vertex and guideline

1045
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:46,400
groups specification ETI is let me see

1046
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,579
iez006 plus 1.1.1 and we invite to

1047
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,859
export from etli

1048
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:55,140
next page please

1049
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,319
okay or this is the motivation of this

1050
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,520
the previous little chair or present or

1051
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,020
on challenge document so uh

1052
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,500
based on we are

1053
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,240
investigate the development of AI

1054
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,599
Services because now the focus is moving

1055
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,599
to training to influence from learning

1056
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,119
through prediction so you know for

1057
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,940
influence not only high performance

1058
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,839
server but also small Hardware

1059
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:29,880
microcontroller low performance CPU and

1060
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,240
AI chipset are the optimal Target device

1061
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,280
provision is to you know the cost

1062
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,700
so we are considered the computation of

1063
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,099
the system in terms of AI influence

1064
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,280
services not of training so if we think

1065
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,800
about portraying the main important

1066
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,440
thing is to Accurate of the model but if

1067
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,839
we think about for influence not only

1068
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,900
accuracy but we must consider other

1069
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,440
items for example Target device

1070
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,140
objectives and conservation others for

1071
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,060
example if you think about Target device

1072
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,960
we can choose a local device edgy device

1073
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,819
or Cloud Server and if we find Watchers

1074
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:13,700
the objectives

1075
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,920
objective of the air model it can be

1076
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,859
diversed for you then put accuracy

1077
00:49:18,859 --> 00:49:22,079
latency for real-time services and

1078
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,440
electrostatic resource utilization Etc

1079
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,060
so I found some consideration for the

1080
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,180
system for AI Implement services or one

1081
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,859
is a model and the other starting

1082
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:37,020
grammar communication method device

1083
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:41,579
capacity important data Etc so the last

1084
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,160
sentence is the main the purpose of

1085
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,760
draft we want to accelerate the study AI

1086
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,880
issue and find some possible

1087
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,160
standardization items in the MLG

1088
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,380
that space please

1089
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,339
yeah so you know I guess you are so

1090
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:01,440
familiar with the generic procedures or

1091
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,319
AI Services the first one is data

1092
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,480
collection store and the next stage is

1093
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,900
to data analysis property process and

1094
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,079
the other next stages AR model training

1095
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:15,300
and Air Model deploy and implants and

1096
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,640
the final stage is Monitor and the

1097
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,000
maintain accuracy so in our threat we

1098
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,819
are not targeting on the training and

1099
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:26,760
model but we are targeting on those

1100
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,060
supports and the the last stage there is

1101
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,400
the AI department and the Monitor and

1102
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,040
maintain the air service qualities

1103
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,319
next page priests

1104
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:42,180
okay so we can uh make a network

1105
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,160
computer structure to provide Air

1106
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,680
Services so first one is the AI

1107
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,079
important service on local machine and

1108
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,300
the second one is air implant service on

1109
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,460
Cloud Server and the last one is

1110
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,339
Implement service on each device

1111
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:59,119
next please

1112
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:03,300
also we can uh combine

1113
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,140
between the ETI device was and the Cloud

1114
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,240
Server for router Theory or task

1115
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,339
operating issue next page

1116
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,800
yeah this is the main part of our draft

1117
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,500
to the first the Contrition is to

1118
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,180
functional characteristic of the

1119
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,319
hardware so uh indoor or it has a

1120
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:28,140
document so it describes various metric

1121
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,359
which can be a potentially be improved

1122
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:33,420
through deploying or service on our MHC

1123
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,980
platform MSC means the mobile Edge

1124
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,380
Computing so it can be identified in

1125
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,480
order to highlight the benefit of

1126
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,880
deploying a machine for better service

1127
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,180
and application so the first is the

1128
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,460
functional metric it includes latency

1129
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,559
and its efficiency through food good

1130
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:50,339
food

1131
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:54,540
lose weight Etc so in the other Metro is

1132
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,579
non-functional metrics it includes

1133
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:59,579
service drives car life cycle

1134
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:03,540
service update Etc so I guess that if

1135
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,859
possible in the MLG we can follow his uh

1136
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:12,059
the approach to find the relevant metric

1137
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:15,359
for the AI development services

1138
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,180
next page please

1139
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,640
yeah so you know the problems are

1140
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,500
important service is very independent on

1141
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,200
how the hardware such as GPU Ram GPU and

1142
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,359
the adult interface is a computer's

1143
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,558
policy Cloud Sovereign

1144
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,380
model so in the distant Cloud Server it

1145
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,140
provides high accuracy short different

1146
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:55,619
time but it has a long delay to transmit

1147
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:58,440
dual device service it provides a medium

1148
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,780
accuracy medium influence time and the

1149
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,579
medium delay to transmit in a local

1150
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,059
machine it provides low accuracy long

1151
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:09,660
interest time but it has the short trade

1152
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,079
to transmit the experience

1153
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:16,380
yeah so we can sum the period from the

1154
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,180
Google accounts Pro it shows the

1155
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,700
trade-off between water size accuracy as

1156
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,520
a latency as you can see we can paint

1157
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,059
the optimal model if we choose the

1158
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:31,079
Border size then we can uh multiple of

1159
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:32,700
other point of view

1160
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,720
and next page list

1161
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:38,220
so it is the characteristic of the air

1162
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,119
model so in usually in the Cloud Server

1163
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,119
we deploy the heavy Air Model it

1164
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,059
provides high accuracy but it has a big

1165
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:51,480
file size and the report and it has a

1166
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,420
long important time in their HD device

1167
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,380
it provides video

1168
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,180
utilized medium Air Model and the medium

1169
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,800
accuracy medium size and medium

1170
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,400
Implement time and in local machine

1171
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,260
usually utilize right to create Air

1172
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,680
Model and it provides the low accuracy

1173
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,680
but it has small size and it has the

1174
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,020
short imprint time so as you can see

1175
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,619
there are trade-offs so accuracy and

1176
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:22,880
motor size and influence time so we can

1177
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,440
choose the best one according to the

1178
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,160
service requirement and so air impress

1179
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,559
service shopping framework is the kind

1180
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,780
of the implementation issue we can

1181
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,760
choose the between traditional website

1182
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,119
foreign

1183
00:55:04,339 --> 00:55:07,319
communication method for example grpc

1184
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:10,140
and we also consider the AI influence

1185
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,140
data which is the real-time requirement

1186
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,559
where it is located style of services or

1187
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,020
it required to secure what it requires

1188
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,460
non-secure

1189
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,800
okay next space please

1190
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,900
so it is something you can pull over our

1191
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,380
prototype so we made some po sheet so

1192
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,119
based on our

1193
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,300
left next page please

1194
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,819
so it is some kind of the results of

1195
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:38,040
those object detection services and

1196
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,099
local machine HD device and Cloud Server

1197
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,260
next page please

1198
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:48,180
so I also request to the church to or

1199
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,300
share our opinion for the relationship

1200
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,660
to challenge document so I believe that

1201
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,760
the challenge document is the main

1202
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,819
document for handling AI issue so our

1203
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,339
ref is also relates to the chilling

1204
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:05,099
document and some tests can be added one

1205
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:07,559
boarded for example distributed AI

1206
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:10,440
Services lightweight AI service and

1207
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,819
deployment AI services or we just our

1208
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:16,740
trip can be deployed as a different

1209
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,680
document to focus on AI influence the

1210
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,260
development AI Services because the

1211
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,480
existing challenge document include many

1212
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,599
items so we can focus on some of the

1213
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,339
specific area

1214
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:31,500
okay next place

1215
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,140
so that's all thanks

1216
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,859
thank you

1217
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:42,680
any question comment yes Alex

1218
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,740
is

1219
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,960
[Music]

1220
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,520
um yeah thank you for our presentation I

1221
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,640
do have a question slash comment uh I'm

1222
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,020
wondering actually how much your draft

1223
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:58,440
is really more about system management

1224
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,319
versus Network management a lot of the

1225
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:03,599
challenges that you've described seem to

1226
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,400
apply more okay what do I have on the

1227
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,920
server the less spots on the network for

1228
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,800
instance also some related challenges to

1229
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,720
deploy points and things like fed rated

1230
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,660
learning or transfer learning across a

1231
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,220
network it's about I think these are

1232
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,960
somewhere where some of the real

1233
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,940
challenges also lie in that in that

1234
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,160
space I don't see the mentioned in there

1235
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,440
in their draft so I'm wondering do you

1236
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,300
see the focus more on the network or on

1237
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,780
the system side and I think my comment

1238
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,339
is I would like to see a little bit more

1239
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:34,559
on the network Inside Yes you know right

1240
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,839
thanks for your application command yes

1241
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:39,240
you're right in the in the current

1242
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,180
document is focusing on the System point

1243
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,880
of view but in the animals and in item

1244
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,280
if here we are finding some of the

1245
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,380
network point of view so this is our

1246
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,319
homework so we will find the two revised

1247
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,619
in the next person to include your point

1248
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:57,059
of view so I think I would have some

1249
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:01,079
suggestion to okay thanks

1250
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,559
for Microsoft thanks for representation

1251
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:07,920
so you've been talking about uh vertical

1252
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,720
uh hierarchy far meet local yes however

1253
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,260
the horizontal here is probably even

1254
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,000
more important here so whether you're

1255
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,040
capable of running your job on one

1256
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,220
machine or on pointer GPU or you need to

1257
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,140
distribute it what do you do with

1258
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,660
network computing with collectives it

1259
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,579
has much more severe complications than

1260
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,559
going far yeah yeah maybe less for

1261
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:33,119
inference more for learning but still

1262
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,099
would be really good to see yes you are

1263
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:38,880
right yes so in our uh experiment we

1264
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,040
have those similar approach we have the

1265
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,859
multiple active device so take the test

1266
00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:46,619
off-roading and find some some the

1267
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:49,140
optimal way how to do so yes you're

1268
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:52,440
right we can not only vertical area but

1269
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,740
we also find the horizontal area for the

1270
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,260
distributed approach would be good to

1271
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,940
see more text then okay thank you

1272
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,480
I have a comment

1273
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,960
um uh Jefferson

1274
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,240
uh I think it would be nice to have

1275
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,099
um to have parted out the the same

1276
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:17,400
dieties that you see uh among the

1277
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,680
documents you know like the one that you

1278
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,380
presented and the research challenge in

1279
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,420
order to see you know how big are the

1280
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,920
difference between and what can be

1281
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,140
merged it's more like a comment

1282
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:39,920
s

1283
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,359
so I think next speaker is online it's

1284
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:44,660
Chris

1285
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,598
foreign

1286
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,440
can you hear me

1287
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,819
yeah yeah we can hear you I don't know

1288
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:04,920
if maybe you can speak a bit louder it

1289
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,160
was a bit uh oh okay I will try

1290
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,380
okay yeah it should be okay thank you

1291
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,900
okay thank you um good morning my

1292
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,540
apologies for being there in person uh

1293
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:19,260
this is a first revision to a draft uh

1294
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:23,460
introduced at the Philadelphia meeting

1295
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,799
the topic is performance oriented

1296
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:28,680
digital twins now for for your package

1297
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,599
and

1298
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,020
next slide please

1299
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,079
so the original draft introduced the

1300
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:39,559
concept of a performance digital twin

1301
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:42,740
for Carrier networks so-called Network

1302
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,760
digital twin

1303
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,319
uh this draft generalizes the concept of

1304
01:00:49,319 --> 01:00:51,059
a performance digital twin so we

1305
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:53,040
introduced the term uh performance

1306
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,200
oriented digital twins

1307
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,200
it reframes the originally presented NDT

1308
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,140
as something specific to packet Networks

1309
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,599
and introduces an optical performance

1310
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,119
digital twin opt that's something

1311
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:07,559
specific to Optical transmission

1312
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:12,599
networks as a second example of podt

1313
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:16,079
it considers use cases for the opdt and

1314
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,240
there's significant congruency with the

1315
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,579
use cases presented in the original

1316
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:24,200
draft for NDT for packet Networks

1317
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,119
and also talks about architecture

1318
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,400
interfaces Etc

1319
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,420
next slide please

1320
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,339
okay so uh again going back to the first

1321
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:41,160
draft the performance oriented digital

1322
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:45,180
twin the idea is to predict or replicate

1323
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,760
pick your verb uh performance behaviors

1324
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,520
of a physical network of course the

1325
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,040
particular behaviors of Interest are

1326
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,460
determined by use case requirements but

1327
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,740
they must be rendered by available and

1328
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,079
appropriate functional models

1329
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:03,780
uh we introduce here the notion of a

1330
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,880
so-called Network information interface

1331
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,799
nii

1332
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:11,099
um this is uh optional or or present

1333
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:13,740
case specific and it's really a twinning

1334
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,520
interface it's where we can absorb data

1335
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,440
from the physical Network and or

1336
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,119
management plane about the Network

1337
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,280
Services traffic environmental

1338
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,500
conditions what have you really all the

1339
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,180
information we would require to

1340
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,520
construct on an ongoing basis say a

1341
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,760
faithful uh replica of of a physical

1342
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,140
Network

1343
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:37,020
the digital twin interface as previously

1344
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,240
defined as a runtime interface and we

1345
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,000
can conceive of the inputs as defining

1346
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,040
the scenario for behavioral assessment

1347
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,559
and so in that sense they would select

1348
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,160
replace uh or complement data present at

1349
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,680
the nii the outputs of course are

1350
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,140
modeled behavioral parameters

1351
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:59,660
and in the interior of the podt

1352
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,579
congruent with the Notions described in

1353
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:04,500
the architecture document we have data

1354
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,260
we have models we have interfaces and we

1355
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,700
have management of all of these

1356
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,500
components next slide please

1357
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:16,380
so the DTI the inputs as they'll show

1358
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,020
they depend on the use case the outputs

1359
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,900
for the opt really are Optical Channel

1360
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,020
parameters so path terminating Channel

1361
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,960
powers and particularly things like

1362
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,059
generalized signal to noise ratios

1363
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:33,119
margins uh things of that nature

1364
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,760
at the nii from the management plane we

1365
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,799
would get network and service topology

1366
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:41,400
these are provisioned Networks and of

1367
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,319
course ITF defines a host of relevant

1368
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:48,119
models and Frameworks actn abstraction

1369
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:49,920
and control of Transport networks from

1370
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,339
teas and related Yang models from other

1371
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:56,460
working groups Being Fit for the purpose

1372
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,339
from the physical Network inventory

1373
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:01,700
device parameters and Status

1374
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,799
instrumentation data things we measure

1375
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,619
on the network alarms Etc and we would

1376
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:09,299
conceive of these normally as coming

1377
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:12,240
through the management plane but that's

1378
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,400
an implementation matter behavioral

1379
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,380
models things like we have to understand

1380
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,740
given given transponder parameters

1381
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:22,140
modulation baud rate Etc back-to-back

1382
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,180
Channel performance things like

1383
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,160
amplifier gain and noise models

1384
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,160
non-linear impairments

1385
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,180
polarization dependent loss filter

1386
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,099
shaping Etc

1387
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:35,180
next slide please

1388
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:37,980
so a quick look at use cases and of

1389
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,960
course planning was a major category of

1390
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,119
use case considered in the first draft

1391
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:44,760
for packet networks and we have

1392
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,220
corresponding

1393
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,839
planning manifestations in the optical

1394
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:51,960
Network case one of them is Optical

1395
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,780
Services planning so if we're looking at

1396
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,760
introducing or provisioning a new

1397
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,599
service or some batch of services we

1398
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,040
need to go through a planning exercise

1399
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,099
and figure out the routes and spectral

1400
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:08,220
allocation but potentially also

1401
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:11,040
transponder parameters in the case that

1402
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,220
we have tunable transponders

1403
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,799
um so the DTI inputs are of course the

1404
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,020
channel parameters postulated and

1405
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,960
postulated service topology

1406
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,400
and really the opt then is returning the

1407
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,319
channel performance parameters it's

1408
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,780
identifying channels that would have

1409
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,540
negative margins or be non-functional

1410
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:36,059
so obviously those are solutions that

1411
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:37,920
would be prospective solutions that

1412
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,400
would be discarded uh and basically the

1413
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,559
findings are used to guide a search for

1414
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:45,839
Server solutions that possibly are also

1415
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,940
efficient in some sense so the possible

1416
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,579
embedding of optimization as described

1417
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,819
in the original draft important to note

1418
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:57,260
that the the opt doesn't

1419
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,940
operate that search it merely provides

1420
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,740
information to it

1421
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,500
Optical Network planning basically the

1422
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,000
same thing only we're looking for

1423
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,220
conjoint service and Network Solutions

1424
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,319
that are both functional and now

1425
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,359
certainly efficient for example in the

1426
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:15,020
sense of some lowest cost of of network

1427
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:18,359
and in this case the DTI net inputs

1428
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:21,540
would have to Encompass both service

1429
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,880
topologies and channel parameters and

1430
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,619
also the newer modified network

1431
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:29,280
topologies uh being postulated next

1432
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,760
slide please

1433
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,539
Optical Services reprovisioning so this

1434
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:38,940
is in support of active operations add

1435
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:40,859
drop reroute for example before

1436
01:06:40,859 --> 01:06:44,880
executing such a change we would want to

1437
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,760
assure that the post-change state is

1438
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,520
entirely functional so we would conceive

1439
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,240
of some algorithms looking for batching

1440
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,220
and sequencing of operations power

1441
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,799
optimizations Etc that will lead to a

1442
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,020
successful reprovisioning and of course

1443
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:05,039
in that search the opt can function can

1444
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,500
assist by looking at the functional

1445
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,420
Integrity of all of the postulated

1446
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,599
service state steps

1447
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:15,240
there's the possibility of risk mapping

1448
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,920
to look at any prospective event

1449
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,960
scenarios and identify potential

1450
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,480
transmission performance issues for

1451
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,059
example we can look at prospective fiber

1452
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:26,520
Cuts examine our planned restoration

1453
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,539
responses in those cases identify

1454
01:07:29,539 --> 01:07:31,980
possible performance risks and where

1455
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,680
such risks are identified we can

1456
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,440
construct new planned Dynamic

1457
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,240
restoration responses and of course that

1458
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,579
whole process can be automated as a

1459
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:42,839
closed loot

1460
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:45,920
next slide please

1461
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,400
and I'll just close with one sort of

1462
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,140
more abstract thought

1463
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,839
um this uh digital twin we've described

1464
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:57,599
is what you might call an information uh

1465
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,520
digital twin it provides information

1466
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,640
given data but the use of that

1467
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,579
information is left to you know it's a

1468
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:07,319
service and whatever the consumers of

1469
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:09,720
that service happen to be

1470
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,200
um you can conceive of and some do a

1471
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,080
larger sort of sphere of action of a

1472
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,198
digital twin imagine ingesting intent

1473
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:23,420
and and issuing Network control outputs

1474
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,920
such a conception though obviously

1475
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,319
encompasses full closed Loops not just

1476
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,600
data to information but information to

1477
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,299
decisions and decisions to action right

1478
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:35,698
so this is a collection of functions not

1479
01:08:35,698 --> 01:08:38,219
a single function but necessarily

1480
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:41,899
including the information digital twin

1481
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:44,939
described as one and such a larger scope

1482
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:46,920
of function frankly starts to become

1483
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,259
difficult to distinguish from a

1484
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:51,600
management plane featuring automation as

1485
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,640
a whole

1486
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,140
so you just throw out the question

1487
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,319
perhaps one suffices is a general

1488
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,580
conception

1489
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:02,339
of the functional scope of the network

1490
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,439
digital twin

1491
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:08,178
all right that's it thank you

1492
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:11,698
yeah thank you okay so

1493
01:09:11,698 --> 01:09:13,560
there is a question from the queue from

1494
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,920
Sean

1495
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:18,839
yes I

1496
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:20,580
thank you for the presentation very

1497
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,219
interesting I wanted to ask did you

1498
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:24,839
consider

1499
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:28,439
um making digital twins of the traffic

1500
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:33,238
patterns uh on a granular flow basis

1501
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:34,319
meaning

1502
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,500
um a digital twin of a subnet or a group

1503
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,520
of uh users to detect Anonymous

1504
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,219
anomalies potential

1505
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:47,640
um lateral movements basically ipfix

1506
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,880
based twins

1507
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,698
uh yeah so I mean that kind of thing was

1508
01:09:53,698 --> 01:09:56,219
considered in the first draft in the uh

1509
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:58,980
NDT dealing with packet networks it's

1510
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:02,340
not relevant to the Optical performance

1511
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,260
digital twin right I mean there we're

1512
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,679
dealing with provisioned Optical paths

1513
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:09,960
but I think if you go to the uh go to

1514
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,600
the draft and and look for the uh

1515
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,840
content specific to the packet Network

1516
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,719
performance digital twin you'll see uh

1517
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,400
you'll see thoughts related to that

1518
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:26,940
and it would be something that the first

1519
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,980
set of authors would probably speak to

1520
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,320
better than me

1521
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,980
thank you

1522
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,219
and you mean just yes I see Jordy has

1523
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:40,199
his hand up so he may be able to yeah

1524
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:41,640
there is a question also in the chat

1525
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,140
from long

1526
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,480
uh maybe you take take this first as it

1527
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,320
was first

1528
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,340
um

1529
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,500
so do you consider the configuration

1530
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,100
type of interaction of on the interface

1531
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,380
for example to confuse your configure

1532
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,300
collection measurement monitoring

1533
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,300
information flows to the podt all right

1534
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,040
this configuration indeed at another

1535
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,580
interfaces by other processes

1536
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,500
you can see the question in the chat as

1537
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,920
well Chris

1538
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:16,280
um sorry I'm just uh

1539
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,420
okay um

1540
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,699
just want to make sure I I understand

1541
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:26,159
the question so the

1542
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,580
CL so first of all the function of the

1543
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,560
performance oriented digital twin it

1544
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,000
does not issue

1545
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,420
control or configuration outputs right

1546
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,520
it provides information to processes

1547
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,699
that may or may not do that

1548
01:11:41,699 --> 01:11:42,540
um

1549
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,520
I'm not sure if that was the sense of

1550
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,800
your question but to be very clear on on

1551
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,420
that point and that's really what I'm

1552
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,280
getting at in this last

1553
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,500
slide week you know the conceptions of

1554
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,900
digital twin that float around I mean if

1555
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,460
we look at the architecture draft right

1556
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,980
we def you know defined as interfaces

1557
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,219
models and data and then something to

1558
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:04,140
manage those together what those provide

1559
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,699
is information

1560
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:09,659
right to provide action outputs or to

1561
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:14,280
ingest uh intent you need more functions

1562
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:17,580
right and ultimately to issue action

1563
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,580
uh on the network you need full closed

1564
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,560
Loops so in our conception that's a

1565
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,460
larger

1566
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:26,820
uh set of functions and again it starts

1567
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,679
to become pretty much what a management

1568
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,840
plan as a whole does so it gets a little

1569
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,679
bit

1570
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:35,040
uh tricky intellectually and and my view

1571
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,620
for the interfaces themselves again the

1572
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,020
idea is that we have a so-called

1573
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,000
twinning interface that you know is the

1574
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,940
steady receiver of information about the

1575
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,800
physical twin and of course in some

1576
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,600
scenarios there may not be a physical

1577
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,980
twin right if we're looking at

1578
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,440
Greenfield planning but in general the

1579
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,239
idea is that there's a physical Network

1580
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,980
that we're trying to replicate as

1581
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,620
closely as possible so the idea is that

1582
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,620
the nni is is the source of of that real

1583
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,080
Network information of course on a

1584
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,320
provisioned network uh the

1585
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,040
um

1586
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,679
uh service topology for example that's

1587
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:13,679
something that's uh controlled and

1588
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,600
understood by the management plan so

1589
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,120
that would be the the source hopefully

1590
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,320
that answers your question

1591
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:26,040
okay thank you maybe you can take the

1592
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,420
question from Alex in the room and

1593
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,900
zanjadi yeah so the Xanax term uh yeah I

1594
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,280
just have a comment on what you put here

1595
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,960
on the last slide I would assume

1596
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,420
actually that the second one is the more

1597
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,580
General conception the one is the first

1598
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,440
one is more restricted right because I

1599
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,760
mean there you're committing to who your

1600
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,420
golden friend is so to speak so I think

1601
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,100
definitely I think it's more interesting

1602
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,140
to look at also number two which

1603
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,060
includes number one

1604
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,520
yeah and I and I you know I understand

1605
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,920
that I I wouldn't want to rule it out

1606
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,020
I'm simply pointing out that

1607
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:01,920
you know the the definition too first of

1608
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,960
all it's not a single thing right it's

1609
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,880
kind of It kind of follows the use cases

1610
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,640
and therefore the the components and

1611
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,860
functions that are involved are are

1612
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,600
variable

1613
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,000
um and the other thing I notice is that

1614
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,280
well it starts to look like a management

1615
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,679
plane as a whole right so and you can't

1616
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,000
just draw

1617
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,699
uh you can't just represent it as the

1618
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:26,219
several functions that deliver you know

1619
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:29,280
an information digital twin function so

1620
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,320
I mean yeah I recognize these there are

1621
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,360
these two sort of conceptions and

1622
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,120
certainly that one is more restrictive

1623
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,659
um simply pointing out that two is

1624
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:41,460
have to be a little bit careful because

1625
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:44,100
it's it's really a collection of of

1626
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:47,760
functions and it's not a single thing uh

1627
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,460
and and one could in fact uh represent

1628
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:53,580
them as you know the new thing here is

1629
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,280
an information digital twin uh

1630
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,199
management planes that are automated we

1631
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:00,659
can construct those as you know the

1632
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:03,840
Assembly of known things intent

1633
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,100
renderers closed Loops uh whatever it is

1634
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:10,500
plus this new thing a digital twin that

1635
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,360
provides information that's that's a

1636
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,159
possibility that's all I'm pointing out

1637
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,980
sure

1638
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,280
okay sorry

1639
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,300
foreign

1640
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,040
our initial scope was rated on

1641
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:41,460
performance so targeting lateral attack

1642
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:45,300
movements it's not in our scope right

1643
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,400
now Sharon it's we were more thinking

1644
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,739
about uh how is Network performing so

1645
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:52,500
are you having some delay at some link

1646
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,199
is there some Jitter that is why you

1647
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,380
would expect and similar questions

1648
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:00,120
however it's an interesting aspect to

1649
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,699
consider also I I'll try to drop your

1650
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:05,880
line later offline about this topic

1651
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,640
and sorry just another Point regarding

1652
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,380
the previous discussion

1653
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:13,380
the focus of that is saying okay what is

1654
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,960
a digital doing useful for and from our

1655
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,980
perspective

1656
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:20,460
we consider number two uh as Alex was

1657
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,540
suggesting

1658
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,280
I acknowledge and I agree that it's

1659
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,780
interesting

1660
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,940
but I think it's broadening too much the

1661
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,679
scope so because if you get a management

1662
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:30,900
plan well I have never operated the

1663
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,300
network except from my home network and

1664
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,219
I think it's too simple

1665
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:38,580
but I mean everyone manages networks

1666
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:41,040
differently and there are like tons of

1667
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,960
different ways to manage networks so

1668
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,320
more perspective it's a scope that needs

1669
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,860
to to Broad

1670
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,940
that's all thanks okay thank you for the

1671
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,480
headings

1672
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,880
okay so there is no other question uh

1673
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,219
thank Chris for the presentation so

1674
01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:03,480
let's move on

1675
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,678
um next presentation

1676
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,960
all right

1677
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,600
Daniel

1678
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,739
yes chair can you hear me

1679
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:30,780
yes we can hear you

1680
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,239
okay this draft is about the

1681
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:35,640
requirements for increases of network

1682
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,159
teaching uh

1683
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,540
next try the place

1684
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:46,800
and as defined in the active research

1685
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,080
group

1686
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,300
just digital key Network Concepts and

1687
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,880
reference architecture the digital thing

1688
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,719
network is defined as a network system

1689
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:00,120
with a physical Network netting and

1690
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,640
virtual team and the two can interact

1691
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,159
with each other

1692
01:18:05,159 --> 01:18:09,360
also and the Titian has the four core

1693
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,739
elements data model mapping interaction

1694
01:18:12,739 --> 01:18:16,639
so next slide please

1695
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:24,179
digital Team Network Concepts and the

1696
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:26,820
reference architecture the interfaces of

1697
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:30,000
digital Network can be divided as the

1698
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,400
thing Northbound interfaces

1699
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,040
in southbound interfaces and the

1700
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,580
internal interfaces so in order to build

1701
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:42,179
this routine Network and realize its

1702
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:45,960
many advantage on different interfaces

1703
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,860
should be able to meet different

1704
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:52,260
requirements and this draft is to

1705
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,239
introduce the requirements for the

1706
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:57,960
interfaces of dtn so the positions of

1707
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,239
different interfaces are shown in the

1708
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,159
figure on the right

1709
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:05,540
so next right piece

1710
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:08,880
so for the requirements for thin

1711
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,000
Northbound interfaces and the thing not

1712
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,880
spawn interfaces is the interface

1713
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,820
between the network

1714
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:19,260
application layer and the team Network

1715
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:22,260
layer so the network application

1716
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,600
requirements are input from the two

1717
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,179
Northbound interface to the team Network

1718
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,780
layer so the thing respond interfaces

1719
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:34,800
can support the rapid deployment of

1720
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,940
network applications such as on the

1721
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,280
network operation and optimization

1722
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,980
Network visualization ancient

1723
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,040
verification Network automatic driving

1724
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:51,000
with lower cost higher efficiency and

1725
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,480
less impact on on the live Network

1726
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,960
Services and so the thing Northbound

1727
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,860
increases should have this

1728
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:04,260
characteristics such as the

1729
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:07,440
um the first one is the of nurse the

1730
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,219
twin Northbound interfaces must meet the

1731
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:13,080
business requirements of different

1732
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,560
network applications and can be imposed

1733
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,520
to the team Network layer so it needs uh

1734
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:25,260
to have good openings and compatibility

1735
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,760
and second is it should be scalability

1736
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,640
so as we all know there are a variety of

1737
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,760
network applications in the network in

1738
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,260
the network application layer so it will

1739
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:42,960
inevitability to lead to the generation

1740
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,840
of network applications

1741
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,780
um and the continuous the development of

1742
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:51,900
the network is bound to introduce new

1743
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,820
network applications

1744
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:57,120
so with the upgrade so with the upgrade

1745
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,000
of network applications and the

1746
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,239
generation of new applications

1747
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:05,699
the team Northbound interfaces should be

1748
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:08,940
able to expand the in-time to meet the

1749
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,699
needs of new network applications

1750
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:15,659
and the third layer is that it should be

1751
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:17,940
portability

1752
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,340
far there are things with different

1753
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:23,100
sizes and functions in the team Network

1754
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,800
layer on the same or similar

1755
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,199
requirements of various applications in

1756
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:30,480
the network application layer may be

1757
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,460
deployed on different things

1758
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:35,760
so the thing not responding interface

1759
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,219
should be easily transplanted and

1760
01:21:38,219 --> 01:21:42,300
deployed on different things and last

1761
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,300
one is it should that it should be

1762
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,000
flexible deployments

1763
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,800
um

1764
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:55,380
that to reduce deployment time and cost

1765
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,820
so next slide please

1766
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,699
so as shown in the three layers redoming

1767
01:22:04,699 --> 01:22:08,159
double closed loop of dtn architecture

1768
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:11,040
the thin Network layer contains the

1769
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:15,719
three key subsystems the data sharing

1770
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:18,239
Warehouse service mapping model digital

1771
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,800
team management

1772
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,460
so is the most critical part of the

1773
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,760
digital Team Network

1774
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,980
and the internal interface of the team

1775
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:31,800
layer refers to the interface within and

1776
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,360
between the three subsystems

1777
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,699
so in order to support the functions of

1778
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:40,980
the three-step systems in the Twin

1779
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,960
Network layer and the interaction

1780
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,360
between the three subsystems

1781
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,120
the internal interface of the thing

1782
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,480
layer should have the following four

1783
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,199
functions

1784
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:58,860
firstly it should be United that each

1785
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:01,380
subsystem in the two Network layer

1786
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,900
should be able to provide the same data

1787
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,780
fromage and the data service for other

1788
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:09,000
subsystems through the internal

1789
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,239
interface of the thing layer that is the

1790
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:16,020
interface should have United and

1791
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:19,500
secondly is the adapted adaptability

1792
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,380
for the net twin Network layer must

1793
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,600
interact with the network application

1794
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,260
layer and the physical Network layer and

1795
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,600
should be well adapted to various

1796
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,140
Network advances and interfaces it

1797
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:38,159
should be adaptability so suddenly is

1798
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:41,520
that it should be Port building the data

1799
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,760
model instances provided by the service

1800
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,219
mapping model subsystem for different

1801
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:50,640
applications may have a high degree of

1802
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,900
similarities

1803
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:55,800
so in order to improve efficiency the

1804
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,679
data model instances must be able to be

1805
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:01,679
provided and deployed through

1806
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,500
different internal interfaces of three

1807
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,640
layers

1808
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:09,420
and the last one is the flexible and

1809
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,580
extensible

1810
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:14,100
the team Network layer must be able to

1811
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:17,940
verify different new network services so

1812
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:20,040
in order to shorten the implementation

1813
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:23,460
time or functions or the implementation

1814
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,520
of functions inside the tin layer should

1815
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,600
be simplified as far as possible

1816
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,760
therefore the internal interface of The

1817
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,100
Ting Network lay must be flexible and

1818
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:41,960
extensible so next slide paste

1819
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:45,780
and this slide is the requirements 14

1820
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:49,080
southbound interface and the things are

1821
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:52,500
spawn interface is referred to the

1822
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,260
interface between the twin Network layer

1823
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:57,480
and the physical Network layer

1824
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,659
also control updates are delivered from

1825
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:03,600
the team suspend interface to the

1826
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,540
physical and 99 work and the wireless

1827
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:08,520
network elements in the physical

1828
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,420
entitled Network exchange exchange

1829
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:15,480
network data and the next Network

1830
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,760
control information with the network

1831
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,360
layer through the thin southbound

1832
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,719
interface so the southbound chain

1833
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:27,739
interface should also have the

1834
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:30,780
characteristics as follows

1835
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:33,199
um first one is the information

1836
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:36,780
interaction capability the 10 Southbound

1837
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:39,900
interface should be able to collect the

1838
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,780
information of different physical

1839
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:45,540
Network elements or network devices

1840
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,120
and since the configuration information

1841
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,520
of the team Network to the physical

1842
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,179
Network for execution

1843
01:25:53,179 --> 01:25:56,520
each can realize the realize the

1844
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,560
information interaction between the

1845
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,320
three Network layer and the fiscal and

1846
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,540
testing Network layer

1847
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:07,159
and the second is the real time

1848
01:26:07,159 --> 01:26:11,100
requirements the realization of Team

1849
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:14,280
network configuration verification and

1850
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:17,159
other functions must have certain real

1851
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:20,520
time so the information collected and

1852
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,620
uploaded from the physical entity

1853
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,480
Network and the configuration

1854
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:28,139
information sent from the Q Network to

1855
01:26:28,139 --> 01:26:30,719
the physical Network must have certain

1856
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,120
real time

1857
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,980
in order to meet the real-time

1858
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,620
requirements of the whole digital thing

1859
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:39,600
Network

1860
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,199
and the next the third layer is the

1861
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:47,340
compatibility so network devices and

1862
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:49,139
network elements from different

1863
01:26:49,139 --> 01:26:51,840
manufacturers use different interfaces

1864
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,719
and protocols uh the southbound

1865
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:58,080
investors must be compatible to ensure

1866
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,580
the relevantage of information

1867
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:02,400
collection and the configuration

1868
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,860
delivered

1869
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:08,120
so next slide please

1870
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,139
so for our next steps we plan to give

1871
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:15,139
some suggestions on the

1872
01:27:15,139 --> 01:27:18,780
applicability of common protocols and

1873
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:21,960
add some security considerations

1874
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,239
uh

1875
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:26,400
and uh that's all

1876
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,679
thanks

1877
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:33,139
thank you any comment our question

1878
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,199
okay I think

1879
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:42,659
um Daniel as you recently proposed this

1880
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:45,179
uh this new contribution I think people

1881
01:27:45,179 --> 01:27:46,860
might need to have some time to read the

1882
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:48,179
document and provide you some feedback

1883
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:50,520
maybe on the mailing list

1884
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,480
um

1885
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,520
and uh thank you again for the

1886
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,500
presentation I propose that we continue

1887
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,840
There is no question now

1888
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,820
and maybe on the chat there is one just

1889
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:02,599
let me check

1890
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,159
okay looks like we should have

1891
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:06,840
discussion interface to network digital

1892
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:10,080
twin from law okay yeah which one is

1893
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,219
regarding that

1894
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,360
okay thank you thank you again uh let's

1895
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,940
move on with the next presentation uh

1896
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:24,199
from Alex

1897
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,600
[Music]

1898
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,480
so yes hello everyone so I'm going to

1899
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,159
present our challenges and opportunities

1900
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,560
in green networking there's a follow-up

1901
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,060
on a presentation that we had also in

1902
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,080
Philadelphia

1903
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,980
next slide

1904
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,219
so again so what is this about so why

1905
01:28:59,219 --> 01:29:01,800
green networking clearly I clearly well

1906
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,440
I think everybody's aware that was using

1907
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,659
the current footprint to Net Zero is one

1908
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:09,900
of the grand challenges of mankind

1909
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,960
and networking applications are of

1910
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,780
course a key enabler in this

1911
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,880
um however the question is is this

1912
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,380
enough

1913
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,480
um and also networks themselves

1914
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,100
contribute

1915
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,440
uh yeah but through the covered

1916
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,480
footprint so hence the question or hence

1917
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,940
basically they I think the fact is that

1918
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,440
the Net Zero mandates will also apply to

1919
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,480
network providers as well

1920
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,880
and so the question is

1921
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,120
um what can we do what can I give an

1922
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,600
irtf contribute uh to those to those

1923
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,840
factors to to uh to to reduce these

1924
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,300
items and really basically a big factor

1925
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,280
our general Hardware advances deployment

1926
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,420
factors and so on we're not talking

1927
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,920
about those but really basically about

1928
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,679
the things that we have influence here

1929
01:29:54,679 --> 01:29:57,920
next one

1930
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,239
so

1931
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,820
um uh yeah so so there's this uh this

1932
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:06,120
draft draft CX green ps01 the purpose is

1933
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,980
basically to analyze the challenges and

1934
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:11,400
opportunities in green uh networking

1935
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,580
Network management we did present a zero

1936
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:16,800
zero in itf114

1937
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,239
um but there are a number of updates

1938
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,860
here for one basically there are

1939
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:23,100
editorial refinements throughout

1940
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,440
um also the original draft was mostly

1941
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,020
about Energy Efficiency or energy usage

1942
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:31,560
efficiency this has been updated through

1943
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:35,159
also emphasize energy sources and

1944
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:37,080
deployment aspects in general not just

1945
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,780
the energy usage efficiency as well as

1946
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,400
to include considerations for the

1947
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,840
manufacturing life cycle of the

1948
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:45,420
equipment that is used to to implement

1949
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:47,760
these there's also there are some

1950
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,699
changes in section 5.2 which grows about

1951
01:30:50,699 --> 01:30:52,280
traffic adaptation it's actually

1952
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,360
generalized also expanded through it

1953
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,420
will be about protocol optimization

1954
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,760
um we added a possibility of convert

1955
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,800
channels to security considerations

1956
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,159
and we have also a new contributor

1957
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:07,080
relative to the to the to the draft

1958
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,659
next one please

1959
01:31:09,659 --> 01:31:12,179
so this was basically just a brief recap

1960
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:15,840
of what's uh what's in in the draft of

1961
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,320
those yeah we haven't read it

1962
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,060
um basically we are structuring the

1963
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,739
opportunity each other's opportunity

1964
01:31:22,739 --> 01:31:27,000
space into four different uh aspects on

1965
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,380
one hand basically we have the device

1966
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,080
and Equipment level at the bottom and

1967
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,480
there as far as Network management and

1968
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,940
iitf and irtf challenges are concerned

1969
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:38,400
we're focusing them mainly on the

1970
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,980
ability to provide visibility as a

1971
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:42,900
foundational problem that will

1972
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,580
essentially enable a lot of the other

1973
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:46,199
schemes and support that building on top

1974
01:31:46,199 --> 01:31:48,239
of them and let's basically to assess

1975
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,760
the usage

1976
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,380
assess and validate the Effectiveness

1977
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,480
and efficiency

1978
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,600
um uh yeah essentially of the energy

1979
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,120
usage and so forth and this is then also

1980
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,100
the basis of course to enable later on

1981
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,980
control routes for various optimization

1982
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:07,380
schemes where you'll take various

1983
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,480
actions for instance to reduce the

1984
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,960
amount of carbon footprint if we will

1985
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,840
all um of course validated but you need

1986
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,699
to see

1987
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:19,860
the feedback of that this requires also

1988
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,260
instrumentation for corresponding energy

1989
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:23,880
metrics there is actually a companion

1990
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:26,760
draft on re-networking metrics which

1991
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,800
basically relates to the metrics not

1992
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,080
just to equipment but also to things

1993
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,540
such as flows and the passwords of all

1994
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:34,620
which are the types of things that we

1995
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:37,080
would want to optimize a network for and

1996
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:39,540
what would want to optimize services for

1997
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:42,320
next one

1998
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:46,320
so the second aspect concern is the

1999
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,060
network as a whole so basically This

2000
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,520
concerns aspect such as challenges

2001
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,100
related to patrol protocol extensions

2002
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,400
what would be needed to consider energy

2003
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:58,500
sustainability and support it is a cost

2004
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:01,739
factor in yeah in network Patrol

2005
01:33:01,739 --> 01:33:03,360
decisions

2006
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,800
um energy if we're routing and path

2007
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,260
configuration where we would have for

2008
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:08,880
this one of the channel how do you how

2009
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,860
can you assess the carbon intensity of

2010
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:13,020
pass if you have the to choose between

2011
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,699
multiple ones how do you optimize the

2012
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:16,679
network overall to minimize the overall

2013
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:18,420
footprint

2014
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:18,960
um

2015
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,260
uh similarly pathway networking steering

2016
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:23,820
traffic along Queen and pasta have been

2017
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:25,860
also actually previous efforts in ITF

2018
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:28,739
regarding this resource weaning schemes

2019
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:31,139
especially if you want to save energy

2020
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:33,840
for one one of the fundamental ideas of

2021
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,340
course that you would want to turn off

2022
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:38,100
resources that may not be needed but of

2023
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,600
course in order to do so you need to

2024
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,060
mitigate other operational goals such as

2025
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:43,380
resilience which you don't want to

2026
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,840
sacrifice as part of that and so there

2027
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,340
are various challenges related to that

2028
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:49,620
also related to this point how do how

2029
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:51,600
will the effects deploy in place virtual

2030
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,100
Network functions and data centers and

2031
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,920
so forth and then finally basically for

2032
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,120
the network as a whole what are the

2033
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,280
green abstractions there not just at the

2034
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:02,100
device level but they are and also to

2035
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,840
take a holistic account not just about

2036
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,780
the network but also about the not just

2037
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,699
about the transmission but about the

2038
01:34:08,699 --> 01:34:10,199
processing about the memory that's

2039
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:14,239
required and so forth next one

2040
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,719
Protocols of this basically

2041
01:34:17,719 --> 01:34:21,179
challenges related to enabling

2042
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:23,580
Network energy saving mechanisms this

2043
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:26,040
blurs to some degrees the boundaries

2044
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:28,159
between membrane and control

2045
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:31,199
plane because uh parts of the aspects

2046
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:32,880
are related to the resource management

2047
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,460
how can you find this commercial

2048
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:38,219
decommission resources uh on very short

2049
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,739
time scales this requires mechanism for

2050
01:34:40,739 --> 01:34:42,120
fast Discovery what's going on the

2051
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,580
network fast reconversions and so forth

2052
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:46,320
here there's a role for autonomics to

2053
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,820
play there are also for intent-based

2054
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,500
networking where we had various use

2055
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,480
cases earlier

2056
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,219
um other aspects concern Network

2057
01:34:53,219 --> 01:34:57,179
addressing instrumentation

2058
01:34:57,179 --> 01:34:59,219
traffic adaptation how can manage

2059
01:34:59,219 --> 01:35:00,900
perhaps the burstiness of network versus

2060
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:04,380
smooth transitions to to affect the

2061
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:07,199
energy transmission Z and so forth next

2062
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,300
one

2063
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,679
and then finally basically at the

2064
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:11,880
architecture level there's a question

2065
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,980
how will you how you would facilitate

2066
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:16,199
the organization of categories

2067
01:35:16,199 --> 01:35:18,480
networking applications that use the

2068
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,120
network to minimize energy consumption

2069
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,460
uh this is the sponsors but there are

2070
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:24,360
examples

2071
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:26,880
such as for instance CDN ICN and coin

2072
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,739
which do some of those things but

2073
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:30,719
basically the question is here how how

2074
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:32,520
is it from an energy perspective so for

2075
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,679
instance when would you deploy we have

2076
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:36,139
this

2077
01:35:36,139 --> 01:35:39,719
deploy cache information what does that

2078
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:42,600
to the overall uh

2079
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,340
balance and so forth next one

2080
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:50,100
so uh then basically the the question we

2081
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,380
discuss here is basically how to move

2082
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:55,260
forward with this draft and we believe

2083
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,300
actually that nmg is a good landing spot

2084
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:01,020
for this many of the challenges not all

2085
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:03,719
of them but I think the majority of them

2086
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:06,480
are clearly management related this

2087
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:07,980
includes points in the starting point of

2088
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,900
the visibility and the insultation the

2089
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,900
metrics and support all of those things

2090
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:14,940
and also on top of that basically many

2091
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:17,820
opportunities then involve management

2092
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:20,100
control groups and deployment

2093
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:22,139
optimizations and these are

2094
01:36:22,139 --> 01:36:23,940
fundamentally management related

2095
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:26,520
problems and challenges

2096
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,800
um and again some of those examples

2097
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,500
there how do you plan routes segment

2098
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,300
files how do you moderate the various

2099
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,219
trade-offs that you have

2100
01:36:35,219 --> 01:36:37,560
um Etc how do you optimize carbon

2101
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,600
footprint as one of the parameters in

2102
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,219
your network deployment

2103
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:42,960
and uh

2104
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,239
this does involve actually many research

2105
01:36:45,239 --> 01:36:47,100
related questions

2106
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,980
um that can also eventually lead to

2107
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:51,960
identify standardization opportunities

2108
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,600
and it's our opinion that this makes

2109
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,760
irtf and it might be an excellent

2110
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,820
candidate to position this work next

2111
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:02,540
slide please

2112
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,980
and so essentially the question to

2113
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:07,440
discuss here is is this management for

2114
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,480
sustainability for greenness a topic

2115
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,580
that nmrg is taking on

2116
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,260
and if so

2117
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,840
um how should we proceed with this draft

2118
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,739
and there are two possibilities

2119
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:19,500
basically to adopt this draft as it is

2120
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,380
or to possibly also break out the

2121
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:24,480
management specifics from the overall

2122
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,460
question because there's some a few

2123
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,800
normal related items also currently

2124
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,260
included in the draft and so with this

2125
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:33,900
I'd like to conclude and request

2126
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:36,259
feedback

2127
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:41,280
oh thanks Alex the sculptor of the draft

2128
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,159
and I haven't updated it but I would

2129
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,139
like to provide perspective from very

2130
01:37:46,139 --> 01:37:48,000
different point of view urgency of this

2131
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,780
work

2132
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:51,179
so traditionally this kind of work was

2133
01:37:51,179 --> 01:37:53,639
done as wishful thinking or you know we

2134
01:37:53,639 --> 01:37:56,159
want to reduce outputs and maybe make

2135
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:58,560
World better place we are getting to the

2136
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,080
point that we cannot deploy anymore if

2137
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:04,860
you look at how Sardis and silicon

2138
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:07,080
technology evolves we double the speed

2139
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,000
every two years so Marlo is still

2140
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
applicable while power consumption goes

2141
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,580
down by half so I wish each generation

2142
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:16,560
so every two years we double power

2143
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,659
consumption on each networking device we

2144
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:20,000
deployed

2145
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,100
from size perspective we are getting to

2146
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:25,800
1.2 gigawatt data centers so there's no

2147
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,480
infrastructure in the world that can

2148
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,639
actually power this kind of data center

2149
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:31,260
cools them down

2150
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:34,139
provide you some comparison for city of

2151
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:37,320
Dublin concerns to gigabots

2152
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:40,739
Microsoft data center 1.2 so

2153
01:38:40,739 --> 01:38:44,219
they're getting close so it's not only

2154
01:38:44,219 --> 01:38:46,920
nice to have we cannot really continue

2155
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:50,159
at the rate we go today we really need

2156
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:52,920
to start looking into how to optimize we

2157
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,440
need to reduce carbon emission we need

2158
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,300
to reduce amount of manifestal areas

2159
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,880
because there's really no no way forward

2160
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:02,940
we are teaching 1.6 there are two years

2161
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:06,000
from now and what's next how do we call

2162
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,500
it how do we deploy it

2163
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:16,560
questions

2164
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:26,880
sorry it took time because my my knee is

2165
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,199
killing me

2166
01:39:28,199 --> 01:39:30,780
in general I believe that this um

2167
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:35,100
keeping this as a as a whole uh study of

2168
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,840
the of the concern is something that he

2169
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,679
said

2170
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:40,560
is a it's a bright way I will go I will

2171
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:44,159
not separate it in different uh matters

2172
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:46,920
and and though I believe that basically

2173
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,360
what we're talking is a little bit

2174
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:51,320
similar to the questions that Chris was

2175
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,300
assuming before about this idea of the

2176
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:57,300
informational and action uh digital

2177
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:00,540
training that are a general at the ends

2178
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:02,040
if you have an action digital train

2179
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,719
you're talking about

2180
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:06,000
a general management tool like AI or

2181
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,820
whatever is how you put these in in the

2182
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:10,980
general management flow here the

2183
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:13,440
question is precisely how we put

2184
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:17,520
Energy Information and how we prioritize

2185
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,159
energy data and energy related decisions

2186
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:22,620
with respect to the other goals the

2187
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:23,780
network

2188
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:26,400
basically what we are adding here is a

2189
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,840
new dimension

2190
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,820
in what we have to manage

2191
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,739
in the goals and essentially in the

2192
01:40:31,739 --> 01:40:32,600
goals

2193
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,880
objectives yes so that's uh I'm making

2194
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,820
emphasis on this on how these uh this

2195
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:40,800
would affect policies and how policies

2196
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,860
have to be expressed and and enforced I

2197
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:46,199
think that this is the main uh the main

2198
01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:48,540
question here because nobody is going to

2199
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:50,760
deny the importance of these or the

2200
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,280
relevance for the for the future of

2201
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,020
networking and even the future of

2202
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:59,159
humankind but the the point here of what

2203
01:40:59,159 --> 01:41:01,500
we should focus is precisely in this new

2204
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,020
dimension right so for those types of

2205
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:06,480
implications if you will on also

2206
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,820
existing existing lessons this has been

2207
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,199
part of the challenges and opportunities

2208
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:11,820
that we would want to precisely actually

2209
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,920
point out here and some of them may be

2210
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,480
straightforward engineering type of

2211
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,520
things then basically okay then we don't

2212
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,320
need to talk about much from a research

2213
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,760
perspective but some other things will

2214
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:23,460
be more closer to research

2215
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:25,739
yeah no it's exactly I'm precisely

2216
01:41:25,739 --> 01:41:28,260
analyzing how these fine-grained policy

2217
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:31,139
how we can assign the priorities what is

2218
01:41:31,139 --> 01:41:34,440
more desirable optimizing bandwidth or

2219
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:36,900
or optimizing immediate consumption

2220
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,940
because at the end everything has an

2221
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:41,540
energy costs

2222
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:45,000
it's an interesting matter and I think

2223
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,040
that it will be as I said the focus of

2224
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:50,060
this thanks

2225
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:53,900
about

2226
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:57,780
uh Jody from Qualcomm so yeah uh for I

2227
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:00,360
guess forever we've been sort of under

2228
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:02,639
the Inspire my Paradigm of um over

2229
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,020
provisioning the networks you know

2230
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:05,219
science right that's sort of been the

2231
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:08,219
philosophy like and we as Engineers have

2232
01:42:08,219 --> 01:42:10,260
often or many times or a hard time being

2233
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:12,300
told don't worry about optimizing it's

2234
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:14,460
over provision so you have you know

2235
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,619
bandwidth and so on

2236
01:42:16,619 --> 01:42:18,119
um so maybe there's an element about

2237
01:42:18,119 --> 01:42:20,280
changing the mindset and saying it

2238
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,619
really uh it's really important to

2239
01:42:22,619 --> 01:42:25,320
design elements that are optimized and

2240
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:27,060
that actually try to to do better than

2241
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:29,820
what we do you know designing to some

2242
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:31,080
extent you know the internet is designed

2243
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:34,860
to you know run 30 utilization so is

2244
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,900
that really the the when we talk about

2245
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,699
carbon footprint is that really a

2246
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:41,100
physical to start front

2247
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:42,780
um and should we sort of also talk about

2248
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:44,760
the mindset of philosophy of how we

2249
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,139
design networks should we try to do

2250
01:42:46,139 --> 01:42:49,580
better than just any foreign

2251
01:42:54,199 --> 01:42:56,219
sustainability also because then okay

2252
01:42:56,219 --> 01:42:58,500
the optimization is just don't do

2253
01:42:58,500 --> 01:42:59,900
networking right just turn the

2254
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:02,340
especially whole thing I've called

2255
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:04,199
bother with it clearly so clearly this

2256
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:05,699
is not the solution either so clearly

2257
01:43:05,699 --> 01:43:07,639
you basically need to mitigate and

2258
01:43:07,639 --> 01:43:11,100
moderate between different goals which

2259
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:12,719
are conflict so basically it's it is

2260
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:13,980
kind of like a constraint based problem

2261
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,540
because the constraint is still that you

2262
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:19,020
need to as far as resilience your cause

2263
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:20,760
and service level requirements as far as

2264
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,080
all of those things are concerned of

2265
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,360
course you need to retain those but

2266
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:27,420
while also making sure that you do what

2267
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:29,940
you can there and the opposite how well

2268
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:32,460
as always between mitigating goals and

2269
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,800
you have also the challenge of of

2270
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,619
policies for instance how uh where are

2271
01:43:37,619 --> 01:43:39,540
you willing to make trade-offs how do

2272
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:40,920
you mitigate between the trade-offs how

2273
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:43,619
do you manage them and so forth so yeah

2274
01:43:43,619 --> 01:43:46,020
this is about part of the challenges

2275
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:48,440
exactly

2276
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,840
a David Summers Harris with Rockton I

2277
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,100
was wondering if it'd be useful to

2278
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,780
clarify the scope of the research

2279
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:57,199
whether this is for a single operator

2280
01:43:57,199 --> 01:44:00,420
providing them with ways to optimize the

2281
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:02,100
energy consumption or sustainability of

2282
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:03,960
their own network or if it's also

2283
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:06,619
including like interoperability between

2284
01:44:06,619 --> 01:44:09,780
so one operator tests I have great

2285
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:12,540
sustainability in my network so if you

2286
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:15,239
route through me then you'll be green

2287
01:44:15,239 --> 01:44:19,380
then how do you prove that and it

2288
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:22,020
reminds me of you know carbon credits

2289
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:23,699
and governments and companies have

2290
01:44:23,699 --> 01:44:25,679
bought them it turns out that didn't

2291
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:27,900
really help the planet at all and they

2292
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:29,340
they're now spending those credits on

2293
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,619
you know right making it kind of dirty

2294
01:44:31,619 --> 01:44:33,300
so how do we do we have to address that

2295
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:36,000
as well is that in scope or we just like

2296
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,719
so that's a great comment actually so

2297
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:42,239
clearly well in in this draft we are not

2298
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:43,980
restricted to one provider but actually

2299
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:46,080
some of the challenges are related to

2300
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,659
specific providers some are related to

2301
01:44:48,659 --> 01:44:50,179
vendor somehow operating for the

2302
01:44:50,179 --> 01:44:52,320
holistic picture which takes all of them

2303
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,300
into account and obviously some of the

2304
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:55,800
things that actually the draft also

2305
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,900
makes mention of that you could say well

2306
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:00,840
as a network provider I optimize just by

2307
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,699
the way I do it in my network and it

2308
01:45:02,699 --> 01:45:04,260
doesn't matter what happens in the data

2309
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:06,420
center for instance you could do that

2310
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:09,119
but of course that well then you shift

2311
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:11,760
perhaps the the Virgin burden somewhere

2312
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,580
else which helps you which helps your

2313
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:16,500
energy cost us but which does not help

2314
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,600
the holistic picture it's appear and

2315
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:20,219
clearly there are both of these because

2316
01:45:20,219 --> 01:45:23,040
that's another of course of the

2317
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,360
challenge is how do we moderate between

2318
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,820
that and yeah of course it's also the

2319
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,619
aspects here how would you assess this

2320
01:45:28,619 --> 01:45:30,659
how do you check for comprises about

2321
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:33,420
that is these are all all of the things

2322
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:37,080
that that will need to be addressed

2323
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:40,760
okay last question

2324
01:45:41,719 --> 01:45:46,080
on mobile here the disease so far if you

2325
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,659
look at the green topic

2326
01:45:48,659 --> 01:45:51,600
a lot of providers is not just facility

2327
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,520
provider there are some like otd

2328
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:54,420
companies

2329
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:58,080
talking about the to recycle the waste

2330
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,560
the heat the heat waste and like by

2331
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,080
using like a liquid cooling and then

2332
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,659
from the hardware it's going to heat up

2333
01:46:06,659 --> 01:46:08,760
the water that's going to be recycled

2334
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,500
used in the community

2335
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,440
so that means if you look at your topic

2336
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,840
so I I agree this is very interesting

2337
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,820
topic and then

2338
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:21,300
um I I support it the thing is here if

2339
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:23,040
you consider those type of scenario

2340
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,500
since you know this one is not a

2341
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,420
standard alone not just like right now

2342
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:29,580
working part it's going to be impacted

2343
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:33,360
either a one minute or the other so I

2344
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,679
don't know whether you have already

2345
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:37,500
considered suppose you can feel

2346
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,719
something if not green since it consumes

2347
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:43,080
a lot of energy however there is another

2348
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,540
scenario in place that's going to

2349
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:49,199
recycle those waste yeah yeah so so this

2350
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:51,119
is one of the charges is actually is one

2351
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:53,100
of the things which is in this newer

2352
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:55,440
draft actually a little bit expanded on

2353
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,860
foreign

2354
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:04,320
recycling the whole manufacturing life

2355
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,679
cycle uh is it so from that perspective

2356
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:09,179
it's certainly good if you can extend

2357
01:47:09,179 --> 01:47:12,719
the life time for for instance of your

2358
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:14,880
Hardware by perhaps making more software

2359
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,860
base if the addressing tool software

2360
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:18,540
upgrades versus relying on Hardware

2361
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:20,760
upgrades and all the basically how to

2362
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,540
how to again manage it all that maybe

2363
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:25,739
when it comes to the metrics that you're

2364
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:27,119
trying to optimize well you could have

2365
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:31,320
for instance sustainability metrics uh

2366
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,020
um how you verify how you assess how you

2367
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:36,239
make sure that they comply one of those

2368
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:38,340
problems there but you could include

2369
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:40,500
that and making them a good part of your

2370
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:43,619
optimization equation

2371
01:47:43,619 --> 01:47:45,960
so going back to networking I think

2372
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,880
we're working in metric normalization

2373
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,780
really

2374
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:52,139
if you're um IPOs Network today

2375
01:47:52,139 --> 01:47:54,960
the number of components that will fit

2376
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,060
into PC computation and provide you

2377
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:57,900
either

2378
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:00,719
short or slow slat and see our login

2379
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:03,480
with maximum protection path right we

2380
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:05,340
don't include

2381
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:07,679
power consumptions computation parameter

2382
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:09,420
or constraint

2383
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:11,699
job by having normalized metrics that

2384
01:48:11,699 --> 01:48:13,800
could potentially come out of this work

2385
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:17,340
towards ATF we could use it in

2386
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:19,860
normalized PC computation to compute the

2387
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,540
plants that made some power constraints

2388
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:23,880
that would be very engineering focused

2389
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:26,639
work and we've been doing the same here

2390
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:28,440
for many years at GP installation with

2391
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:30,900
GPS extensions how this work is being

2392
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:33,500
done for a long time

2393
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:36,840
thank you thanks we have to stop here

2394
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,760
for this just just uh share with your

2395
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:40,139
comments from Lauren that it's important

2396
01:48:40,139 --> 01:48:42,300
to frame the point in space and what an

2397
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:44,580
energy can raise degree address

2398
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:47,159
so let's move on to last presentation by

2399
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:49,940
Nature

2400
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:55,380
I was in danger time wise there when

2401
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:56,580
that's such an important presentation

2402
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:57,960
was only for me so I need to be what's

2403
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,820
the question so I'm looking at this

2404
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:02,219
presentations on um modeling boundaries

2405
01:49:02,219 --> 01:49:04,699
and its boundaries in modeling languages

2406
01:49:04,699 --> 01:49:08,100
it's actually a draft into netmod but

2407
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:09,540
time one is Brandon here because I think

2408
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:11,219
there's some forward-looking stuff you

2409
01:49:11,219 --> 01:49:13,080
can do the next slides

2410
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,820
so uh how long got this video review

2411
01:49:14,820 --> 01:49:16,199
just keep a couple of few points at the

2412
01:49:16,199 --> 01:49:17,219
bottom there

2413
01:49:17,219 --> 01:49:20,460
um I've been grappling with this for um

2414
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:22,860
a long time and it's been it's clear

2415
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:24,300
there's a there are issues in the

2416
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:25,440
modeling languages that make it

2417
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,639
difficult to deal with so I'll explain

2418
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:30,600
the details next slide please

2419
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:33,300
so um the draft actually has a number of

2420
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:36,300
observations of challenges in modeling

2421
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:38,460
and it focuses a lot on

2422
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:41,340
um modeling of um representations that

2423
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:42,420
involve

2424
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:45,300
um dealing with constraints and

2425
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:46,739
um I've picked out a number of things

2426
01:49:46,739 --> 01:49:47,940
here all of which you've got very

2427
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:50,460
similar requirements in 10 modeling and

2428
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:52,920
intent of capability expressing

2429
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,380
restrictions I picked out one their

2430
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:56,639
partial visibility which is one that

2431
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:59,040
doesn't get much uh attention but this

2432
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,320
is where I can't I can't fully see the

2433
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:05,280
the um the monitoring or the detectives

2434
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,260
in the network and out and partial view

2435
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:08,639
of that which looks somewhat like

2436
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:10,980
constraints the process in negotiation

2437
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:13,560
where I move through from a fairly

2438
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:16,020
abstract and nebulous view of what I

2439
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:17,639
want through to a much more specific

2440
01:50:17,639 --> 01:50:19,199
thing that again a set of constraints

2441
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,360
these two in technicals

2442
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,040
and all of these

2443
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:26,280
um require some view of uncertainty some

2444
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,840
of your vagueness

2445
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,060
um in interrelated

2446
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:32,040
um attributes and properties and so on

2447
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:34,199
which have got have got constraints and

2448
01:50:34,199 --> 01:50:36,119
it's really constraints

2449
01:50:36,119 --> 01:50:38,480
the um

2450
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:41,219
representation of these things

2451
01:50:41,219 --> 01:50:43,800
progresses through a set of

2452
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:46,619
um gradual narrowing so especially in

2453
01:50:46,619 --> 01:50:48,060
negotiation I started with something

2454
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:49,920
fairly fabulous and I gradually narrow

2455
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:53,040
down to a precise level if I look at

2456
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,719
um intent

2457
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:57,000
um I I may have an intent that starts

2458
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,520
off as relatively vague and then becomes

2459
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:02,000
more refined as the as the

2460
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,619
implementation takes place

2461
01:51:04,619 --> 01:51:06,719
and there's a number of levels through

2462
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:08,520
this it also applies as I look at

2463
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,560
especially as I look at um specification

2464
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,179
I've got an example the later of

2465
01:51:12,179 --> 01:51:14,820
capability where I move from

2466
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:16,739
um a standard specification through a

2467
01:51:16,739 --> 01:51:19,080
number of vendor restrictions and so on

2468
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:20,159
I'll go through

2469
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:23,360
um a um an example of that

2470
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:26,219
these narrowings relating what we've had

2471
01:51:26,219 --> 01:51:27,840
to classify with a new term there's a

2472
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,520
big terminology problem this is proved

2473
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,960
to be difficult to actually discuss this

2474
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,000
space because of lacking terms we have

2475
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,699
classes instances and then we run out so

2476
01:51:35,699 --> 01:51:37,980
we um coined this term in in the onf

2477
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:40,500
work of occurrence which is a thing

2478
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,719
that's some way through the progression

2479
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:45,840
of um narrowings of definition

2480
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:49,980
and um through this work and certainly

2481
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:52,199
in the draft we've looked at the uh

2482
01:51:52,199 --> 01:51:55,679
opportunity to to generalize classes and

2483
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:58,260
um and instances to form this Inc

2484
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:59,940
occurrence thing so I wanted to really

2485
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:02,159
get some feeling from the group as to

2486
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:03,179
whether this was interesting whether

2487
01:52:03,179 --> 01:52:05,159
other people were in counseling similar

2488
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:06,239
things

2489
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,940
and uh when the other thing is when I

2490
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:10,679
started building up a system a picture

2491
01:52:10,679 --> 01:52:13,920
of a system uh definition uh we see the

2492
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:17,280
same thing Assemblies of of occurrences

2493
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:19,260
um rather than instances and rather than

2494
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:21,480
classes so I'll try and Show an example

2495
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:22,740
of that

2496
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:23,100
[Music]

2497
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:24,199
um

2498
01:52:24,199 --> 01:52:27,540
the um the Assembly of a system you get

2499
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:29,639
many similar but not identical

2500
01:52:29,639 --> 01:52:31,679
occurrences where you're placing

2501
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:33,179
constraints on the behavior of a

2502
01:52:33,179 --> 01:52:35,520
particular thing that narrows it from

2503
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,080
the class but doesn't make it into an

2504
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:38,880
instance and this was the the general

2505
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:41,580
problem so the draft goes through these

2506
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:43,739
um these these General sort of

2507
01:52:43,739 --> 01:52:45,840
principles and so on and it makes a

2508
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,159
number of observations in those areas

2509
01:52:47,159 --> 01:52:50,280
against the next slide please thanks

2510
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:55,440
so um the solution we need a a modeling

2511
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:58,800
approach that allows us to better Define

2512
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,659
these intermediate stages of this

2513
01:53:00,659 --> 01:53:02,639
recursive narrowing so we move from a

2514
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:05,280
maybe a class through to some

2515
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,080
um a number of different alternative

2516
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,880
views of that class that are narrowed

2517
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,199
slightly

2518
01:53:10,199 --> 01:53:13,260
um that have restricted opportunities

2519
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,900
for attribute values and so on but there

2520
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:18,179
may be several different restrictions in

2521
01:53:18,179 --> 01:53:21,659
a particular problem situation

2522
01:53:21,659 --> 01:53:23,940
um and then as we looked at this we felt

2523
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:25,980
that any level this model would end up

2524
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:28,260
with something that has

2525
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:32,280
um definition of of what looked like

2526
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:34,880
um types but they're narrowed and also

2527
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,260
definition of what looked like instance

2528
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:38,699
values because there's a single fixed

2529
01:53:38,699 --> 01:53:40,320
value and what that essentially ends up

2530
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:44,040
with is any particular definition is a

2531
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,260
definition of a narrowed constraint even

2532
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:48,300
if it's a single value that's still a

2533
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:49,800
narrow constraint so even a single even

2534
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:52,320
even an expression of a an instance

2535
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:54,600
value is a constraint

2536
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,400
so the um

2537
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:59,219
and that leads us to potentially a

2538
01:53:59,219 --> 01:54:01,440
single way of expressing everything from

2539
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:05,100
classes all the way through to uh to um

2540
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:07,380
instances

2541
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:09,000
the conventional modeling techniques we

2542
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,500
use tend to break it into those two

2543
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:12,000
things a class or an instance we have

2544
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,980
those two sort of levels we don't I mean

2545
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:16,080
all meta classes but we don't have this

2546
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:19,020
this gradual slide and

2547
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,760
um the the property types you have like

2548
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,040
integer tend to emphasize that it's got

2549
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,980
a single value whereas if I'm monitoring

2550
01:54:25,980 --> 01:54:28,320
something I may find that sometimes I've

2551
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,420
I've got uncertainty in the measurements

2552
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:32,580
and I'm not sure whether it's five six

2553
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:34,619
or seven but other times I'm I've got a

2554
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:36,659
precise value sometimes I can't see it

2555
01:54:36,659 --> 01:54:37,679
at all

2556
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,500
so these sorts of things tend to

2557
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:43,020
um push us towards a distinct way of

2558
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:45,360
representing compared to what we would

2559
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:47,760
traditionally do and we found as I've

2560
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,380
been through as I mentioned a long time

2561
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:51,300
challenging with this as we go through

2562
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:53,100
the challenge we've uh through the

2563
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:54,420
challenge of modeling particular

2564
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:56,100
problems we found we had to put special

2565
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:58,080
attributes in to deal with these funny

2566
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:01,560
cases and so on you keep finding them so

2567
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,300
um I put this into net mod because I

2568
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,340
felt that or we felt that

2569
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:07,139
um there was an opportunity in Yang

2570
01:55:07,139 --> 01:55:08,760
itself to

2571
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:11,639
um to extend the language to deal with

2572
01:55:11,639 --> 01:55:13,260
these challenges and we've got a

2573
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:15,360
proposal in the back of the uh or a

2574
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,460
sketch of a proposal in the back of the

2575
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:19,440
draft that shows some of the things you

2576
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:22,020
could do potentially with Yan and it

2577
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:24,179
would seem to be possible to extend it

2578
01:55:24,179 --> 01:55:26,280
within its current definition so it's

2579
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:28,139
compatible with existing things which I

2580
01:55:28,139 --> 01:55:29,460
think is critical

2581
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:32,460
thanks

2582
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:35,400
so just to get some the things here just

2583
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,440
to emphasize so so intent in the in the

2584
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,960
draft uh I use expectation and tension

2585
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,300
rather than um intent really because

2586
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:43,800
there's two sides of that there's the

2587
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,420
client side expect stuff and the

2588
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,760
provider size and tends to deal with the

2589
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,380
thing but that's desired outcome in

2590
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:50,820
terms of constraints are to emphasize

2591
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:53,699
that capability is about opportunity for

2592
01:55:53,699 --> 01:55:56,100
Behavior to be exhibited and that of

2593
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:57,840
course is again a range of possible

2594
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,699
restrictions and constraints and the

2595
01:55:59,699 --> 01:56:01,920
partial visibility as I said is is

2596
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,580
um imprecise measurements in a lossy or

2597
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:08,460
um uh environment where I've got a um a

2598
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:09,659
challenge with noise or something of

2599
01:56:09,659 --> 01:56:10,920
this sort where I can't actually see it

2600
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:12,960
fully what's going on she goes to the

2601
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:14,580
next slide please

2602
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:17,219
thanks so this is just to emphasize this

2603
01:56:17,219 --> 01:56:19,500
gradual progression on narrowing it's a

2604
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,600
it's obviously in our arbitrary rough

2605
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:24,540
example but I may start with a um a

2606
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:25,800
standard definition of something where

2607
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:28,679
I've got a an integer it's um boundless

2608
01:56:28,679 --> 01:56:30,060
essentially it's full range of the

2609
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:31,679
institutes specified inherits no

2610
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:33,900
constraints whatsoever I find I have a

2611
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:35,760
two particular

2612
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,100
um implementations that a vendor has

2613
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:40,560
um where and why it's got arbitrarily

2614
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,360
chosen here of course 10 gigs to 100

2615
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:44,639
gigs or something another one's got five

2616
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:46,920
to fifty where there's some constraints

2617
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,600
in the particular technology so I've got

2618
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,760
two different realizations in my

2619
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,860
particular solution here I want to be

2620
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:54,739
able to express those two different uh

2621
01:56:54,739 --> 01:56:57,480
capabilities then in an application I

2622
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,280
only need 10 to 50 gigs I want to

2623
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:02,880
express that constraint I have a further

2624
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:05,219
point maybe in the application where

2625
01:57:05,219 --> 01:57:07,260
it's um at a particular point in the

2626
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:09,719
solution there's a a specific uh

2627
01:57:09,719 --> 01:57:11,699
restriction on the Range so it's only 30

2628
01:57:11,699 --> 01:57:13,679
to 50 gigs a particular place same

2629
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:15,480
implementation Hardware we're in some of

2630
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,760
the particular place and in a proof of

2631
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,099
concept sorry if I've got some busy hour

2632
01:57:20,099 --> 01:57:21,900
thing I'll say it's always 50 gigs so

2633
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:23,460
I've got these different levels of

2634
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:24,960
setting for this property and I'm going

2635
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,300
to set ranges and single values in the

2636
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:29,639
property and again other examples proof

2637
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:31,260
of concept different narrowing maybe

2638
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:32,940
it's turned into an enumeration because

2639
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:34,860
I've only got three improved points I'm

2640
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:37,619
going for and um when I look at the

2641
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:40,199
instance at the bottom there I've got an

2642
01:57:40,199 --> 01:57:43,020
intent instance one the intent is set to

2643
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:45,659
30 or 40 another one that's particularly

2644
01:57:45,659 --> 01:57:47,639
40. so I've got different ways of of

2645
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:49,619
constraining this very simple property

2646
01:57:49,619 --> 01:57:50,699
and I've got various different

2647
01:57:50,699 --> 01:57:53,099
occurrences of these constraints in the

2648
01:57:53,099 --> 01:57:55,199
uh in the solution spaces you just try

2649
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:57,300
to illustrate the the sort of range of

2650
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:59,820
narrowing from a standard through a

2651
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:01,320
number of different cases whether each

2652
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:02,699
expressions are the same property

2653
01:58:02,699 --> 01:58:04,980
they're each expressions of the integer

2654
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:06,840
but their expression to the integer in

2655
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:09,060
in terms of different nouns if you go to

2656
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:11,340
the next slide this

2657
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:13,860
so um nothing goes through this in

2658
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:16,860
detail but the um this this the draft

2659
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:19,260
does but the the key thing here is I've

2660
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:21,900
assembled the system out of

2661
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:24,540
the same pieces the brown pieces here

2662
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,040
with the same letters all the same

2663
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,719
pieces but each has been used in a

2664
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:30,179
certainly different role and each is

2665
01:58:30,179 --> 01:58:32,280
being used in a a way where it's

2666
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:34,020
constrained to perform a different

2667
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:35,940
function it's the same underlying thing

2668
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:38,099
but the specification for it is

2669
01:58:38,099 --> 01:58:39,540
constrained and each of those things in

2670
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:42,659
that figure are essentially occurrences

2671
01:58:42,659 --> 01:58:44,400
because they're not instances critical

2672
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,900
happening instantiated when they're just

2673
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:48,119
in the pan so the occurrence here is a

2674
01:58:48,119 --> 01:58:50,040
is a pattern tool as well here essential

2675
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,260
that lets me lay out different

2676
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:54,960
um cases of use of a particular single

2677
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,580
thing in a system design

2678
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:59,639
and the this this actually is is a a

2679
01:58:59,639 --> 01:59:01,380
sketch of a management hierarchy

2680
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:03,179
abstracting

2681
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:04,860
um uh signals from the rnf work

2682
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:07,560
abstracting from a network View to a a

2683
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:10,260
sorry a noble virtual Network you do the

2684
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:11,520
next slide please I think I'm going to

2685
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,020
skip the next one yeah I'll skip this

2686
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:14,820
one actually because it's a detail on

2687
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:17,099
the slide and the the key thing here for

2688
01:59:17,099 --> 01:59:20,460
the um the first thing is we've had

2689
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:22,560
terminology problems trying to try to

2690
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:24,119
discuss this and so on so getting a

2691
01:59:24,119 --> 01:59:26,159
better view of the terminology the

2692
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,900
labels we use and the problem in the

2693
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:29,760
problem spaces we chose the term

2694
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:31,320
occurrence because it appeared to be

2695
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:32,699
something that wasn't being used and it

2696
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:35,060
did appear to sort of emphasize the

2697
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:37,260
instance-like nature of this thing but

2698
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:39,659
not an instance

2699
01:59:39,659 --> 01:59:40,280
um

2700
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:43,020
there's not a good language for this

2701
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:44,580
again so

2702
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:46,560
um representing or there doesn't appear

2703
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:48,719
to be um we we can't find a language

2704
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:51,360
that seems so uml has classes and

2705
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:54,659
instances Yang has the same sort of two

2706
01:59:54,659 --> 01:59:56,580
positions and so on there don't seem to

2707
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:58,260
be any languages that give us this

2708
01:59:58,260 --> 02:00:01,440
gradual slide from a vague notion

2709
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:04,340
through to a a very specific definition

2710
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:07,139
so we're looking continuing to explore

2711
02:00:07,139 --> 02:00:08,639
we haven't found anything looking again

2712
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:10,199
into the group to see if anybody's aware

2713
02:00:10,199 --> 02:00:12,139
of anything that does this sort of

2714
02:00:12,139 --> 02:00:14,340
represents this sort of thing well and

2715
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:16,800
as I said in the internet mod because we

2716
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,780
feel that Yang could be extended in this

2717
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:20,040
way then

2718
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,080
um into this direction and we felt that

2719
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:24,119
this was a good influence in that mod

2720
02:00:24,119 --> 02:00:26,340
so that's all I have I've got some

2721
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:29,040
backup slices with some stuff in the in

2722
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:30,780
the draft which hopefully you could read

2723
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:34,679
and um maybe give some feedback on

2724
02:00:34,679 --> 02:00:37,199
thank you thank you Nigel unfortunately

2725
02:00:37,199 --> 02:00:38,340
we are

2726
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:40,760
um the end of the time of the meeting

2727
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:43,440
I'm sorry for that so maybe this was the

2728
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,960
best would be that people can uh can

2729
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:48,119
send comments or questions offline yeah

2730
02:00:48,119 --> 02:00:51,420
and of course so also follow your work

2731
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:53,960
in that mode

2732
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,219
yeah sure

2733
02:01:02,219 --> 02:01:05,340
so thank you again Nigel thank you and

2734

02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:10,320
having joined this meeting and so we'll

2736
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:13,500
