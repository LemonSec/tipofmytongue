not that we really need it but for the

5
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,940
extremes the remote stream we do

6
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,800
and this one's working well this one's

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,640

oh yeah

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,100

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,539
mm-hmm

11
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,220

the other thing while we're getting

19
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,019
started um is there anybody ordinarily

20
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,239
ditch or helps take notes but Dieter is

21
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,680
not well today so I was wondering if

22
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,879
anybody else would be willing to help

23
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,560
take notes

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,220
anyone

25
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,280
excuse me

26
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,780

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,759
processes that govern the the way the

46

ITF operates so please make sure you are

47

um this

57
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,699
uh

58

is this is the agenda for today it's up

59
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
on the notes pad

60
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
um if somebody

61
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,520
a little bit faster on the link wants to

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
stick the link into the you should be

63
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,240
able to find it from the agenda page on

64
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,860
the ietf you'll see which one is the

65
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,840
notepad or somebody could stick it into

66
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,639
chat for folks that are unfamiliar with

67
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,280
that particular thing feel free to add

68
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
to the notes as we go

69
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,300
that will be turned into the minutes at

70
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,280
the end so

71
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,139
uh with that

72
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,940
are there any is there any agenda

73
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,940
bashing any comments or questions

74
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,139
nope

75
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,819
okay

76
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,699
so the first thing is uh we have our

77
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,100
document status review update page

78
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,900
reminding us of the things that we are

79
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,400
working on

80
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,479
um

81
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,680
the uh first thing is we do

82
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,160
a second thing I did forget uh I'm sure

83
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,500
by Friday everybody knows this please be

84
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,780
sure to scan the QR code that's what

85
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,340
we'll use to manage the queue and it

86
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,199
also does the attendance or the virtual

87
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,960
blue sheets so don't forget to do that

88
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,660
um we do have a new RFC

89
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,240
RFC 9327 which is the control messages

90
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,840
protocol for the use with ntp V4 this uh

91
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,199
has been published as a historic RFC in

92
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,819
the category historic as opposed to

93
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,940
experimental informational or any of

94
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,520
those things so um

95
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,000
a special thank you to Brian Haberman

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,580
um and to Eric for a great deal of

97
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,160
patience uh in getting this through the

98
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,500
process we have three more documents

99
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,759
that have sort of passed the working

100
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,139
group

101
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,479
um and into

102
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,440
um at fdiesg in various stages uh the

103
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,680
first one is the interleave modes

104
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,479
which we

105
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,819
believe we're basically going to defer

106
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,460
to V5 but we wanted to discuss did you

107
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,039
want to talk about that

108
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,479
works

109
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,460
words words are always good

110
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,340
uh yes so Eric client the um interleave

111
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,460
modes we brought it to the telechat it

112
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,319
got uh um

113
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,500
One Security ad abstained uh and some

114
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,879
other people were very operational

115
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,080
people were very concerned about the

116
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,280
safety

117
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,800
uh my proposal was that if we wanted to

118
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,620
continue with the document we should

119
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,080
I think the why this is safe stuff is is

120
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,820
spread out through each different

121
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,458
possible mode description and it might

122
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,500
be worth reiterating all of that in a

123
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,300
one common section before that that says

124
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,800
look this is really not scary and not

125
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,940
only is it not scary it's actually

126
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,380
running now and

127
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,300
and things haven't blown up

128
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,240
uh but uh if we you know we could do

129
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,320
that and then I can bring it back to

130
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,540
telechat if we want or we could not

131
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,700
pursue interleaved modes for V4 anymore

132
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,100
and just leave that as a feature to be

133
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,200
baked in from the beginning for V5

134
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,899
that's whatever the the authors and the

135
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,899
working group wants to do I don't know

136
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,580
so but uh Lars is pinging me saying hey

137
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,779
why what are you going to do with this

138
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,019
so uh it's currently in some limbo State

139
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,540
basically between maybe we'll do

140
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,560
something with it and maybe we'll

141
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,779
abandon it but if we get to know what

142
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,279
the working group wants to do one way or

143
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,899
the other

144
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,420
right so I think we we

145
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,560
um

146
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,080
we basically have have two options one

147
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,580
would be to send it back to the working

148
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,980
group and then to update it

149
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,899
um with the additional safety

150
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,000
information in a more concise manner

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,519
like you're talking about or we declared

152
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,019
a dead document and then just plan to

153
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,300
work on it as far as

154
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,459
data tracker statuses go those are our

155
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,740
two options right uh well for the first

156
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,120
one bringing you back to the working

157
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,160
group is an option uh it could also just

158
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,200
be handled by

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,740
the author uh you know I mean it depends

160
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,779
on on how significant we think it is if

161
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,640
it's a restating of text that already

162
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,360
exists and has consensus then uh we're

163
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,620
just like copying that and putting it

164
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,120
out into one place for clarity I don't

165
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,140
think that has to come back to the

166
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,459
working group because we haven't changed

167
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,920
anything okay uh if we do decide to

168
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,240
dramatically alter something the meaning

169
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,800
of something or whatever then yeah we

170
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,880
would probably read back to the working

171
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,700
group but I think it can be treated as

172
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,399
editorial oh okay uh and it could just

173
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,680
be handled by the author and just reply

174
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,420
to the people who have the feedback at

175
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,279
this point the document has changed

176
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,860
telechat has changed iesgs

177
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,740
uh so the objections were from some

178
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,120
previous members who are no longer on

179
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,459
the ESG so I would have to bring it back

180
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,940
to telechat but Miroslav could just take

181
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,200
some edits and

182
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,959
we could bring it back okay I'll try

183
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,160
again

184
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,320
and and marisolv has conveniently

185
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,459
already joined the queue go ahead

186
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,800
marisloff

187
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,040
oh hi uh yeah

188
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,140
I think

189
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,959
at that time this was discussed last

190
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,880
time I think there was a suggestion to

191
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,899
try to change it to an informational

192
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,320
document and that would be more likely

193
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,160
to

194
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,010
be accepted by isg

195
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,720
[Music]

196
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,079
is this still an option or

197
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,660
would it be would it make it more likely

198
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,740
to work

199
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,079
um I I think some I mean possibly I

200
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,579
don't know what would change the minds

201
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,740
of of everybody who still holds uh

202
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,060
concerns

203
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,480
I think the main concern from the Ops

204
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,680
ads

205
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,899
was that they they did not believe it

206
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,760
was safe to do they were not convinced

207
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,899
that it was that that widespread

208
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,560
um problems would would not happen uh so

209
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,420
I think they just needed some my

210
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,339
impression or my recollection is that

211
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,140
they just needed some convincing they

212
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,540
needed some reassurance

213
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,820
so uh I don't know that changing the

214
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,300
informational is required

215
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,220
so I think it was more about wait wait

216
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,380
wait wait wait why is this safe how is

217
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,300
this not going to break everything it

218
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,500
didn't really

219
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,420
they weren't able to glean that easily

220
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,920
from the document and if we made it easy

221
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,220
for them to see that it was in fact safe

222
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,079
that was that was

223
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,360
that's my current understanding yeah I

224
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,980
don't think the status of the document

225
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,680
necessarily would change that

226
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,420
information

227
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,680
sorry it's still they might still be

228
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,640
concerned about safety

229
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,140
how do you write do you like this

230
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,779
version of the draft that has a new

231
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,959
section on the safety of the protocol I

232
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,680
think this was published after the last

233
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,779
round of discussion so I'm not sure if

234
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:49,740
they

235
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,540
cylinder

236
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,700
I'm not actually sure if I if I know

237
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,740
that you had uploaded a new version if

238
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,600
you have then I can go chase down people

239
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,579
to to re-review it

240
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,519
well it's a few years ago so I'm not

241
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,660
sure

242
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,199
I

243
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,279
okay that's on me then I will take I

244
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,779
will take the action item to go review

245
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:10,860
the diff

246
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,260
and uh and then chase down people's

247
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,139
additional uh re-reviews

248
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,820
okay thanks

249
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,399
so so marislav

250
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,380
did I understand you correctly you

251
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,480
uploaded a draft that addressed that or

252
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,579
did you send an email with a suggestion

253
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,279
I think I

254
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,899
I told long ago that I'm not sure

255
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,959
anymore but this was after the

256
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,899
the email discussion we'd have we had

257
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,480
with isg

258
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,480
and I I haven't seen any anyone

259
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,880
responding to that so I'm not sure if

260
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,200
anyone actually read it

261
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,880
um

262
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,459
I can I can take the action item too

263
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:57,839
catch up on all the threads and make

264
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,060
sure that everybody has uh seen all the

265
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,339
new proposed texts whether it's in email

266
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,300
or in document form I'll do that okay

267
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,620
all right thank you marislav

268
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,800
so I think the

269
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,420
so you're going to check on the status

270
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,519
but the plan is to still continue to try

271
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,040
and publish and not to defer

272
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,579
hmm

273
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,260
yeah that's what that's what I heard

274
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,420
okay okay we might as well uh take

275
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,639
another run at it and and see what

276
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,959
happens

277
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,240
if everyone if if everyone's hair is

278
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
still on fire then we'll we can

279
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,540
reevaluate after the after the second

280
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,560
attempt

281
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,040
okay

282
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,839
um

283
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,339
so that's where we are with interleave

284
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,339
modes uh updating the ntp Registries uh

285
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:51,420
has been

286
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,079
uh submitted and uh

287
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,339
is in the process of being reviewed and

288
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,079
the Enterprise profile has been

289
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,639
submitted but it's still lacking a

290
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,779
Shepherd right up so

291
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,800
oh you did an ad eval and it has a

292
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,940
revised

293
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,800
um

294
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,680
yeah I think the tick tock uh doc I I

295
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,360
reviewed and I gave some comments and

296
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm waiting for a new version to be

297
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,740
uploaded which possibly I missed in my

298
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,500
inbox but uh yeah yeah I know I don't

299
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,620
there has not been an an updated draft

300
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,880
okay

301
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,240
so I missed that you did a Navy eval so

302
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,680
I thought I sent some comments I'll

303
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,540
double check that too I'm sure you did

304
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,220
and I missed it

305
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,500
and that can go to ietf last call as

306
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,000
soon as there's a new version as soon as

307
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,060
we get a new version on it okay great

308
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,319
uh so this one

309
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,139
so updating ntp Registries is waiting on

310
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,180
Eric to double check and Enterprise

311
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,779
profile is uh waiting on the authors to

312
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,600
submit an updated draft

313
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,440
um

314
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,740
so that's where we are with all of those

315
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,040
the next

316
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,079
uh

317
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,940
set of topics these are all things that

318
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,639
we've had some at least a little bit of

319
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,399
discussion on since the last meeting uh

320
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,519
for Kronos uh

321
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,000
uh Netta is on the call this has

322
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,360
a past working group last call and all

323
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,339
of the comments have been addressed and

324
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,880
the latest draft address is the last of

325
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
the typos that were found is that that's

326
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,880
correct right Neda

327
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,939
so I think it's it is random right now

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,160
I hate to do this to you could you say

329
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,779
that one more time please

330
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,040
uh sorry

331
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,139
um yeah I I fixed the type of that

332
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,079
Denmark was found and I also went over

333
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,420
the draft once again top down to see

334
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,480
that to make sure that everything was

335
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,500
clear

336
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,459
so I think

337
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,480
um and and looking at the slides here I

338
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,640
realized that I forgot to change the C

339
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,240
to a k so for those who who are who are

340
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,119
following this work at a distance uh the

341
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,220
name got changed from Kronos with a c to

342
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,640
Kronos with a K uh because of some uh

343
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,980
conflict issues uh we're not going to

344
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,280
change the file name uh itself but it

345
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,760
will be changed in the documents and in

346
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,620
the title

347
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,260
with that uh Dieter and I talked earlier

348
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,179
this week and

349
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,059
this is ready to go to the isg and he is

350
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,520
going to manage the shepherd right up

351
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,740
for that

352
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,179
how much

353
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,679
did you have you had nothing did you

354
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:53,700
have anything else you wanted to say on

355
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,679
the Kronos

356
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,580
nope

357
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,340
okay

358
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,400
um

359
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
so the next thing we're going to talk

360
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,740
about is ntpv5 on a number of topics uh

361
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,320
the

362
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,880
first thing we're going to talk about is

363
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,780
our we did have a small

364
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,120
hackathon team here on the weekend and

365
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,620
David's going to talk about what they

366
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,799
did

367
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,360
okay hello I'm David

368
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,820
um uh during the hackathon we spend a

369
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,360
bunch of time on entity particularly uh

370
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,880
next slide please focusing around

371
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,000
the the main problem questions of

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,840
can we build uh

373
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,760
experimental interoperable

374
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,679
implementations for this and are there

375
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,280
any major technical gaps uh in the draft

376
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,160
as it currently stands

377
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
um the results we have next slide please

378
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,980
uh for that are there is now two

379
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,080
experimental implementations one of

380
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,520
these existed already before the weekend

381
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,640
continuous labs and the other one came

382
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,700
about mostly this weekend

383
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,860
um we verified that they are indeed

384
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,840
talking happily to each other they seem

385
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,740
to be synchronizing all the loop

386
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,440
um detection algorithms which is the

387
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,539
main part of what we're now focusing on

388
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,539
where what the current draft mostly

389
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:34,140
focused on uh initially seems to be

390
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,299
functioning correctly seems to be

391
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,039
reasonably easy to implement across

392
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,440
implementations

393
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,520
um

394
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,919
so we've identified a few minor issues

395
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,580
in the ntpdrs implementation uh these

396
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,620
have since been fixed and a few more

397
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,960
have been found since the hackathon and

398
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,520
have also been fixed so if you were

399
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,340
using it for whatever reason uh there

400
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,000
are updates available now again

401
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,580
um and we've also had uh We've

402
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,700
identified a few minor

403
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,320
things as well with the draft but we'll

404
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,419
get to that in a minute and we've had a

405
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,740
lot of discussions on time skills and

406
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,080
leap seconds because those are fairly

407
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,380
hard and I will get to those

408
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,740
at least to some extent later as well

409
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,240
um next slide please

410
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,299
so the main takeaways we've had is that

411
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,780
time scale offsets especially for ut1

412
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,520
with uh as they currently stand in the

413
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
draft won't fully work

414
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,380
particularly should in the future it

415
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,419
ever get decided that UTC moves away

416
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,940
from having leap seconds as at that

417
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,340
point the ut1 offset would be larger

418
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,660
than one second in the current draft

419
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,660
just assumes it's below a second

420
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,820
and we've identified that there is a

421
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,220
need still for a case of that type

422
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,039
mechanism that was an ntp before it also

423
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,740
have like an 1955 and that we need to

424
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,559
start adding that to the current draft

425
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,900
um

426
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,520
these were the main takeaways next slide

427
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,440
please so these were the people who were

428
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,720
involved in the hackathon and a short

429
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
list of links for all of the main things

430
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,700
that were touched during the hackathon

431
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,620
for those interested are there any

432
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,679
questions about anything I've said so

433
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,860
far

434
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,760
no questions

435
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,559
uh thank you all very much

436
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,240
it was very productive

437
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,399
um

438
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,720
okay

439
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,559
um

440
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,120
I don't

441
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,580
I don't see James in the meeting there

442
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,480
has not been an update to the use cases

443
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,580
and requirements document there has been

444
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,820
some discussion about uh needing some

445
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,280
more detail and and the feeling that

446
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,200
we're not quite hitting the hard issues

447
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,520
yet

448
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,140
um

449
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,980
and

450
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,640
we would like to wrap this up I was

451
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,440
sort of hoping to wrap it up by the end

452
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,179
of the year I think we probably ought to

453
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,000
Target the um

454
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,880
next meeting that the next uh physical

455
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,820
meeting so maybe the Yokohama ietf if we

456
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,260
could Target having that at least sent

457
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,120
to the iesg that would be really helpful

458
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,340
does anybody have any comments on the

459
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,740
use cases and requirements has anybody

460
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,820
reviewed it recently

461
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,340
oh wait

462
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,600
you can walk that way

463
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,500
uh hi David again

464
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,659
um there there's one thing

465
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,000
um I think we should still work on

466
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,200
getting a little bit tighter

467
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,780
on what our priorities are going to be

468
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,120
around synchronization performance

469
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,780
versus security uh in the in the

470
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,380
protocol in the requirements document

471
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,559
uh because I think we're going to at

472
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,480
some point have to make trade-offs in in

473
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,340
that and it would

474
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,880
I think we need to think about those

475
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,559
beforehand uh before we start getting

476
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,799
down into the weeds but

477
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,780
um are there any thoughts on that from

478
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,639
commercial in particular

479
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:43,400
foreign

480
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,080
do you have any comments on the oh he's

481
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,780
joining excellent

482
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,340
[Music]

483
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,280
I think you are referring to the

484
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,880
correction field which wouldn't be

485
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,679
authenticated maybe this is the

486
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,360
discussion we had I think on the

487
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,120
hackathon

488
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,820
if we need to

489
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,380
authenticate everything or if it's

490
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,080
acceptable for the correction field

491
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,940
because that would be difficult for

492
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,159
Implant to implement in the networking

493
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,820
devices too

494
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,740
re-authenticate

495
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,960
10 DB message if it was modified so

496
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,000
there is a question if

497
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,919
if it's acceptable to make some fields

498
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,419
um

499
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,520
outside of the

500
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,139
authenticated payload

501
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,179
um in my opinion

502
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,440
I think that's okay because

503
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,900
the impact that

504
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,659
an attacker a man in the middle attacker

505
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,280
could have

506
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,220
by modifying the data in the

507
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,200
unauthenticated

508
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,960
part of the message is still smaller

509
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,280
than

510
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,200
the impact

511
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,400
that for example the delay attack has

512
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,780
basically

513
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,960
delaying the message as a bigger impact

514
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,280
on the

515
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,159
measurement of the client then

516
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,600
uh

517
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,799
would have the

518
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,080
the modification in the unauthenticated

519
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,900
part in the correction field

520
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,059
as long as the client

521
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,700
verifies that the correction is not

522
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,820
larger than the measured delay

523
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,820
so yeah my opinion is that

524
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,360
this is okay but maybe others don't

525
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,199
share this with you

526
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,779
um yeah to respond to that that is one

527
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,520
aspect I think we should consider but

528
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,020
also in general when we start

529
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,539
introducing

530
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:05,039
mandatory signing which is one of the

531
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,679
things the the requirements now

532
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,980
pretty much hints I thought we should do

533
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,100
um you're going going to add crypto

534
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,279
crypto to the uh response

535
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,520
uh the request response path at the

536
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,039
server which is gonna inevitably add

537
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,340
additional resonance time on the server

538
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,240
side

539
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,340
which

540
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,400
will impact some of the uncertainty in

541
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,779
these algorithms

542
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,720
for synchronizing everything and I think

543
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,700
we should we should we should be

544
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,799
thinking about what what Traders are we

545
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,480
willing to make there

546
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,380
um

547
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,900
they're there as well as in

548
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,120
do do we find that an acceptable

549
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,120
trade-off uh

550
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,059
and and how how are we going to be

551
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,440
looking at that moving forward

552
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,580
go ahead mayor sloth

553
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,500
there is with the internet there should

554
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,200
be no impact on

555
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,779
on accuracy or stability of the

556
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,820
synchronization

557
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,000
with respect to the great operations

558
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,840
that may take longer so I don't see

559
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,459
these are as a concern

560
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,679
okay Rick

561
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,740
foreign open Fortress

562
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,320
um I'm very happy that as if if the

563
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,600
cryptos actually made very strong

564
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,200
and because many cryptographic

565
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,419
algorithms base uh they really heavily

566
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,400
on time and this has been very very long

567
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,860
been a problem that we looked away from

568
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,600
it because that was nothing that really

569
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,200
allowed us to synchronize with

570
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,520
cryptographical strength it's an

571
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,500
important thing to have proper timing

572
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,299
and to be sure about it

573
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,000
so please don't make any trade-offs in

574
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,620
that respect and especially if you can

575
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,260
just measure the signing time and take

576
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,120
that make the part of your calculation

577
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:28,080
any anything else on this topic

578
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,220
um

579
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,580
I think given the uh

580
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,779
I think what we're going to need to do

581
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,240
that this document is fairly solid I'll

582
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,100
check with James and see

583
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,960
we might need to do a working group last

584
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,480
call to see if we can get people to

585
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,240
review it for the last time

586
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,220
in the meantime feel free please to

587
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,659
review it on the mailing list that would

588
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,460
be great

589
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,340
all right the next topic is the ntp V5

590
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,220
specification this has been stable for

591
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,779
quite a while

592
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:58,440
um

593
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,419
and we now have two interoperable

594
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,240
implementations it's been out for

595
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,880
a call for adoption

596
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,980
I've heard no opposition to the fact

597
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,520
that we plan to adopt this document so

598
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,559
with that we will be

599
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,059
adopting it as a working group document

600
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,059
is there any comments or questions on

601
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,240
that

602
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,200
okay I'll do the data tracker magic

603
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,120
later today and marislav if when you get

604
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,740
a chance if you want to

605
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,620
submit an updated draft with the working

606
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,120
group name on it that would be great

607
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,580
okay

608
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,880
um the next item was a discussion of

609
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,799
time scales

610
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,500
um as as David hinted there was some

611
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,020
discussion of this at the hackathon so I

612
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,779
think it's top of mind

613
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:00,679
go ahead

614
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,080
ali

615
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,799
um

616
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,380
yeah so after having a couple of

617
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,360
discussions with a number of people I

618
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,640
started to realize that the requirements

619
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,720
document is not as clear

620
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,539
as the opinion some individuals might

621
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,700
have as to which approach we're going to

622
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,659
take

623
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:25,740
for uh time skills essentially there's

624
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,840
from from what I've been able to tell

625
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,340
and please correct me if I'm wrong on

626
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,320
this uh mayor swath there's there's

627
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,880
roughly two approaches we can take here

628
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,860
we can

629
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,380
um say that all-time stamps included in

630
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,140
in ntp exchanges

631
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,840
are always time stamped according to

632
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,120
whatever best approximation a server has

633
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,899
of one specific time skill for example

634
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,440
Thai or for example UTC

635
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,820
and then we provide sufficient

636
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,260
information

637
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,140
in addition to those timestamps to be

638
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,240
able to get to whatever time scale an

639
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,360
end user might want to use

640
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,159
depending on what asks for or there's

641
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,539
the approach and this is the approach

642
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,279
that's as I understand it is currently

643
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:11,220
in the draft is we leave these

644
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,679
timestamps essentially

645
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,559
leave it open which time scale that is

646
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,179
on the protocol packet of course

647
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,940
specifies this but there's not all ntp5

648
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,820
package used this time scale for their

649
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,740
um for the timestamps and then

650
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,460
optionally on top of that provide the

651
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,220
mechanism for exchange of information on

652
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,659
how to translate between these different

653
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,880
time skills

654
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
um

655
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,320
I I think we should have the discussion

656
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,059
which of these we prefer

657
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,500
um perhaps that is a discussion for the

658
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,520
mailing list

659
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,659
um I'm

660
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:48,720
but I I think we need to explore what

661
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,520
the advantages and disadvantages of each

662
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,500
of these approaches are because

663
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,620
um

664
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,779
I don't have a full feeling for which

665
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,159
option we should choose at this point

666
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,700
go ahead Miroslav

667
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,820
oh yeah I would like to add that my

668
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,179
focus was on to allowing the server

669
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:19,080
to have a preferred time scale because

670
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,020
you know in the basic mode the time

671
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,120
critical

672
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,480
part is between uh capturing the

673
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,700
timestamp

674
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,740
from the clock that the server is using

675
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,760
and

676
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,080
putting that in to the message so

677
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,000
the idea was that

678
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,700
the server could have a preferred time

679
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,799
scale which could use for the transmit

680
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,260
timestamp and for the other timestamps

681
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,500
because it's simpler

682
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,940
to

683
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,120
specify it and implement it and if the

684
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,260
client

685
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,100
needs a different time scale than yeah

686
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,899
it should be able to get the missing

687
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:04,140
information to convert the plans

688
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,500
into its own preferred time scale

689
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,940
so

690
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,120
you know the focus was on the server

691
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,199
side to make it

692
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,820
easier to implement

693
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,879
the protocol by allowing the server to

694
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,500
to use for example for instance Hardware

695
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,080
timestamping where

696
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,480
it might not be possible to implement

697
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,440
UTC

698
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,860
only without leap seconds so

699
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,140
the client would need to be able to

700
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,340
convert it

701
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,360
to UTC if the server is providing

702
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,600
timestamps in time

703
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,279
any thoughts on this topic from anybody

704
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,779
else

705
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,559
anybody else online

706
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,360
I know 1588 has done a fair amount of

707
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,039
work looking at Alternatives time time

708
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,440
scales as well so we should probably

709
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,879
make it take a look at what they're

710
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,099
doing to make sure that anything we do

711
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,899
would at least be aligned somewhat with

712
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,879
what they're doing

713
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,219
um because a lot of ntp and PTP systems

714
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:20,060
need to coexist

715
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,520
um

716
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,960
okay

717
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,940
um so that brings us to the end of our

718
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,879
ntpv5 list of topics the next agenda

719
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,580
item is rough time the last

720
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,179
um

721
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:40,020
update of the

722
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,020
I just lost my data try others the last

723
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,540
update of the rough time document was at

724
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,639
the end of September

725
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,020
um

726
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,980
I know Marcus had planned to have a

727
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,780
during the hackathon he had planned to

728
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,119
have a virtual hackathon effort there

729
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,500
were a number of parties that had

730
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,140
indicated interest

731
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,640
but they were all going to be remote

732
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,180
participants and at the end of it we

733
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,320
actually ended up with none of them

734
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,380
except for Marcus coming Christopher

735
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,880
from net node was here and was working

736
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,460
on it a little bit as well but um he

737
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,940
ended up focusing primarily on ntpb5

738
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,900
um

739
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,320
so we didn't have much activity during

740
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,800
the hackathon on rough time

741
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,520
um

742
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,280
and the authors of the document are not

743
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,240
here

744
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,920
so I think about the only thing that we

745
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,640
can do is ask for um

746
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,380
some additional comments and review on

747
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,820
the list I don't think there's been any

748
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,680
comments on the list of this document

749
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,079
since it was last published

750
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,940
um

751
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,700
is there anything

752
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,740
the other thing was is that the uh just

753
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,440
as a comment the rough time

754
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,280
ecosystem document has expired

755
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,859
so is there anybody here who wishes to

756
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,578
speak to rough time

757
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,700
oh hi Ben go ahead

758
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,260
hi there

759
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,480
um yeah we're quite interested in rough

760
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,520
time at Google and actually we've we've

761
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,960
just been going over the draft there's a

762
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,339
there's a group of us who are planning

763
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,560
to do some work on it uh we've gone over

764
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,420
the draft we got pilot comments which we

765
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,599
will a small pile of comments which

766
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,460
we'll post to the mailing list

767
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,640
um uh next week sometime uh and we are

768
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,280
planning to do an implementation

769
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,599
um of

770
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,180
some future ID when it's in the shape

771
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,619
we're happy with

772
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,780
uh we're planning to use it as part of

773
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,060
our work on supply chain security stuff

774
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,599
in general

775
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,820
oh thank you

776
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,540
good to know

777
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,900
um

778
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,060
so with that uh we'll look forward to

779
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,500
the Google comments coming on the

780
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,940
mailing list and if anybody else could

781
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,800
please review the document and put some

782
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,300
comments on the mailing list that would

783
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,460
be very helpful

784
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,839
anything else on rough time

785
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,680
okay

786
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,200
we have two pieces of work that we have

787
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,960
not had recent updates on the ntp over

788
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,359
PTP it has been out for a call for

789
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,760
adoption I've seen no opposition to

790
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,420
doing that and so at this stage we will

791
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,700
be adopting that document

792
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,160
um I'm assuming mayor slav you don't

793
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,420
have any comments you're just waiting

794
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,680
for us to adopt it correct

795
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,320
okay

796
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:35,160
um and the um

797
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,920
oh that's funny there's an edit a a copy

798
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,599
and paste error on my slide so ignore

799
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,300
everything after NTS over PTP

800
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,640
they might look suspiciously familiar as

801
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,980
the items that were under the document

802
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,980
update slide three slides ago

803
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,000
um

804
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,440
so the NTS over PTP effort there is

805
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,900
still interest in doing it the primary

806
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,160
author

807
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,359
um

808
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,700
was doing some collaboration with an

809
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,280
industry partner and they have not

810
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,079
gotten that update done yet

811
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,560
so there is no update to report

812
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,300
last I heard they were hoping to get

813
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,400
something out

814
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,000
in the November time frame so hopefully

815
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,500
we'll see something coming out of that

816
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,700
pretty soon

817
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,799
anything else on NTS over PTP

818
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,579
okay

819
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,579
um

820
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,859
so we have

821
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,020
any other business and Way Forward at

822
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,339
this stage

823
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:38,640
the any other business does anybody have

824
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,140
any other business that they'd like to

825
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,319
bring

826
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,660
oh

827
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,359
yeah sorry if this is like an aob moment

828
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,579
I just wanted to say two thank yous uh

829
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:58,320
one thank you to everybody who helped me

830
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,119
close out all of the

831
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,880
open erata that was super helpful and

832
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,640
very much appreciated uh and to uh thank

833
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,880
you to everyone who uh did some uh very

834
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,339
nice hackathon work that will be good to

835
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:12,839
show in the shepherd write-up that there

836
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,420
are interoperable implementations

837
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,220
so

838
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,079
thank you all

839
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,220
yes thank you

840
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,720
um

841
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,399
any other any other businesses

842
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,060
okay

843
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,720
um

844
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,940
as I mentioned earlier the attorney I

845
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,560
met earlier this week and and we're

846
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,599
discussing ways to keep us moving

847
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,420
forward on a more steady Pace

848
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:39,960
um

849
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,780
I think for the ntp working group in

850
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,980
particular sometimes the virtual

851
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,480
interims are a little bit more effective

852
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,820
just because

853
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,619
of the

854
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,680
the

855
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,520
they're more effective in keeping us

856
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,040
moving so we do plan to have uh some

857
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,780
virtual interims we're currently

858
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,480
planning three between now and the next

859
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,800
ietf those are our tentative dates

860
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,460
um

861
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,200
this will be in the minutes if anybody

862
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,339
has any

863
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,560
uh

864
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,420
strong objections to any of these dates

865
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,820
so please feel free to speak up it's

866
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,859
it's roughly a month or every month or

867
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:19,140
five weeks between now and the March

868
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,640
ietf meeting

869
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,720
the March ietf meeting is in Yokohama

870
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,420
we will be thinking about uh what we can

871
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,359
do in the context of a hackathon I think

872
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,180
the lesson we learned with NTS and that

873
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,359
we are relearning with ntpv5 is it

874
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,880
really helps to focus the work and move

875
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,380
it forward if we can have a little bit

876
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,339
of hackathon activity on the pro

877
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:47,900
protocol as we're moving forward

878
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,359
um so we'll be needing to figure out who

879
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,220
from the ntp community might actually be

880
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,260
able to participate in Yokohama or be

881
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,599
willing to participate remotely

882
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,660
on hackathon activity during Yokohama

883
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,760
working hours

884
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,420
so keep an eye out for that

885
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,520
the other thing that we have talked

886
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,400
about doing is I think we have

887
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,300
um

888
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,940
you know we're a little bit you know a

889
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,040
couple years into the deployment of NTS

890
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,119
and we're beginning to see some

891
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,800
deployment reports and experimental

892
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,300
results that we would like to talk about

893
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,700
and see how that's going and what

894
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,140
lessons it might teach us going forward

895
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,300
and so we are planning

896
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,260
um

897
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,540
to have

898
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,119
a discussion specifically focused on the

899
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,040
deployment status of NTS to see if we

900
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,380
can get some idea of who who's using it

901
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,760
and how they're using it what kinds of

902
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,440
results they're looking at

903
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,180
um

904
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,540
and so I I think since this is such a

905
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,560
new

906
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,359
protocol it would be really helpful to

907
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,780
get some perspectives on that

908
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,740
um

909
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,220
and with that is there any other

910
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,240
um

911
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,420
anything else people want to uh

912
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,440
bring to the floor

913
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,020
next time I'm going to bring popcorn or

914
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,359
something maybe maybe sugar snacks

915
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:15,300
that's what you need is sugar snacks

916
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,940
so with that uh I'm going to close the

917
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,400
ntp working group meeting for ietf 115.

918
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,400
everybody have a safe trip home and uh

919
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,500
hopefully we will see you virtually and

920
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,700
in person in the future

921
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,640
foreign

922
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,079
because

923
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,859
the important part

924
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,359
on Monday

925
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,319
oh that probably will

926
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,720
I am intending to be

927
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,339
I am intending to be

928
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,160
happy

929
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,420
it's the first one that's reasonable

930
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,800
post for me

931
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,839
uh so that one's definitely doable

932
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,119
it would be really nice if I could swing

933
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,740
it but

934
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,220
MLS Joshua yeah

935
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,060
find out
