25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,100
today and the art area meeting just

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,780

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,700
meeting of the week we like to go over

28

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,140
navigate a successful ITF in terms of

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,080
logistics and meeting interaction

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,079
so if we go through the slides

32
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,840
to start with please note the note well

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,820
you will have agreed to this when you

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,500
registered for this meeting but it's

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,360
just a reminder to you that all of these

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,360
various policies are in force this

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,340
includes working group processes things

38
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,380
on anti-harassment Code of Conduct

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,200
copyright by participating which is

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,899
speaking sending emails like joining in

41
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,460
meetings you agree to follow these

42
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,799
processes and any such contribution is

43
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,560
covered by these processes so it's

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,420
really important that you note the note

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,399
well that's why it's called note well

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,760
and if we skip ahead

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,299
foreign

48
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,300
there's always going to be teething

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,580
problems in the first week here so

50
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,980
in the first session

51
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,980
if you're able to skip the slide on

52
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,060
thank you

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,220
so this session is being recorded you

54
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,900
can find it on YouTube afterwards if you

55
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,060
want to watch yourself back

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,520
um for those in the room you must sign

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,980
in to the session using the meat Echo

58
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,140
lights client which you can find on the

59
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,480
data tracker agenda here this is true

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,239
for every session and it helps us manage

61
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,099
the micro queue so that whether you're

62
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,280
virtual or you're in person we see you

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,780
in the order you joined the queue okay

64
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,459
so it's really important we don't favor

65
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,500
impersonal virtual participation when it

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,239
comes to the micron

67
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,360
if you are not using the on-site version

68
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,800
we ask that you keep your audio and

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,739
video off to help us go through as

70
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,379
smoothly as possible and importantly for

71
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,180
those of us in person in the room you'll

72
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,220
see we're all wearing masks that's not

73
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,720
because it's a fashion statement it's

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,239
our mask policy so please wear your

75
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,340
masks unless you are actively speaking

76
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,800
at the microphone there you have the

77
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,840
option to remove your mask but as I am

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,760
clearly demonstrating the mask does not

79
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,400
inhibit the audio in any way so it

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,260
really is your choice

81
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,540
for remote participants we strongly

82
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,420
encourage you use a headset if at all

83
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,640
possible

84
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,819

standard for

147
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,340
for carrying conversations and why

148
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,199
that's really important for us to

149
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,139
put some energy into that so next slide

150
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,320
please

151
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,979
um so in in my particular field of

152
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,500
communications which is real time

153
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,460
business stuff uh the rage for the last

154
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,479
five or ten years has been

155
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,880
conversational Commerce conversational

156
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,900
work

157
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,979
machine learning Etc and so the unit of

158
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,380
exchange as a conversation has become a

159
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,460
a real Focus for for us

160
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,280
and um

161
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,280
when I took my new job just about a year

162
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,120
ago

163
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,400
I realized that in my particular company

164
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,620
which is not unusual

165
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,720
we have about a million conversations a

166
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,360
month a year with customers and we

167
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,580
record them like most agent which most

168
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,259
companies do

169
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,880
um and we have them over five different

170
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,699
Services a web chat a dialer an inbound

171
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,520
queue a phone system

172
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,319
um and what's happened is all this data

173
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,639
that we've been collecting about our

174
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,220
customers is siled and it's splattered

175
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,440
all around my company

176
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,819
um and so because uh we don't have a a

177
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,160
general definition of how to capture a

178
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
container a capture a conversation

179
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,620
um I don't actually have any standard

180
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,479
tools by which I could measure what's

181
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,699
inside of a conversation

182
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,160
and that ends up being really um

183
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,919
important uh not only spiritually but

184
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,979
legally uh many places as you understand

185
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,919
have uh right to be forgotten laws where

186
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,199
customers can say I like you I like my

187
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,780
data back and what you have of mine

188
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,000
um I can't answer that definitively for

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
all the most important data which I've

190
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,479
captured about my customers

191
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,360
their voices their wants their faces and

192
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,539
it's everywhere I liken it to uh the

193
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,340
days before the relational database and

194
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,780
we had all that data on all of our

195
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,060
workstations all around the network

196
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,759
it was ungoverned it was unusable it was

197
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,060
unshareable it was a mess

198
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,319
um and so

199
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,539
um and then finally I want to I want to

200
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,099
point out that

201
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,560
uh the conversations that we use today

202
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,539
are an active

203
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,020
uh place for automations for insight for

204
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,259
sentiment for for generating models for

205
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,900
providing

206
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,080
uh uh the fuel the food for artificial

207
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,140
intelligence and machine learning and we

208
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,240
have a an oncoming I think maybe

209
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,940
economic disaster which is when a

210
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,559
customer asks you

211
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,679
to remove their data

212
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,899
um you also have to rerun the models

213
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,320
that were used with that data and the

214
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,480
large models today on average cost

215
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,060
around fifty thousand dollars to rerun

216
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,640
which is approximately the amount of

217
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,399
energy contained in a boxcar full of

218
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,380
coal

219
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,060
and if we have to be doing this every

220
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,760
time a customer says forget my data we

221
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,100
better be really careful about what data

222
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,140
is used to train the models next

223
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,080
slide please yep thank you so where what

224
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,120
we're suggesting here and we've we've

225
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,500
implemented this

226
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,779
um after the last slide you'll see the

227
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,700
writing code that we have that we're

228
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,080
running it now

229
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,700
we believe a conversation actually has

230
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,200
four parts and if you think about it

231
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,040
very

232
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,600
briefly you might think a conversation

233
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,000
might be an MP3 file or a transcript but

234
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,920
it's really not sufficient

235
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,700
um

236
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,519
but it but it's necessary obviously and

237
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,839
we're talking about every part of a

238
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,080
conversation the video the audio the

239
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,360
transcripts whatever Mark Zuckerberg has

240
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,800
next

241
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,420
all of these things all these things

242
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,800
which you can capture the personal

243
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,839
details of you are important to manage

244
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,820
but but something else which is also

245
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,839
important to manage is of course

246
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,000
identity and we've done a lot of work in

247
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,160
stir shaking trying to fix the identity

248
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,560
problem we believe that the identity of

249
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,000
a conversation can be just as important

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,920
as a conversation itself

251
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,320
um and so we believe it's time for a

252
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,660
real upgrade in the way in which we

253
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,279
relate

254
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,800
um identity two conversations uh the old

255
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,740
world of called detail records is is the

256
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,060
Old World

257
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,339
um the last two parts I think are really

258
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,740
the juice of the the matter it's easy to

259
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,899
think of this as being somewhat

260
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,480
you know innocuous because what what is

261
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,820
a conversation and an identity but the

262
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,459
last two are simply what are the the

263
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,519
analysis of this conversation that goes

264
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,779
along with the conversation is the

265
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,000
customer angry is are they are they

266
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,459
lying to you what's the authenticity of

267
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,720
what they're saying are there

268
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,240
translations are there transcripts that

269
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,000
analysis should be paired with not only

270
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,160
the conversation but the context of the

271
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,720
conversation for my company we're a

272
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,360
sales company we have leads the leads

273
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,440
would be something that would be

274
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,480
appropriate to capture with the

275
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,279
conversation for the context of it but

276
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,779
it might be the PowerPoint that you had

277
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,899
on a zoom meeting it might be

278
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,839
um uh you know the the V cards or the

279
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,459
participants it might be the vcon that

280
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,440
you use to make this thing and there's

281
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,360
the new v-con all kinds of things used

282
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,980
for attachments next please

283
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,820
so the Becon standard approaches all of

284
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,839
these

285
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,779
um these points we've put the draft in

286
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,600
um and what we're what what we're asking

287
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,180
here is for your involvement and for

288
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,459
work group to come and help us really

289
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,140
solve this problem while it's still

290
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,579
solvable

291
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,140
this is not something that the vendors

292
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,399
are likely to do because it's a cross

293
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,720
vendor problem

294
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,240
even those vendors who say we can do

295
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,339
everything don't do everything and even

296
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,620
if I'm not picking on them but even if

297
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,500
Genesis said we can provide all of your

298
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,779
communication stuff you may be one

299
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,640
company that only has Genesis there

300
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,500
isn't one because Genesis doesn't do web

301
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,000
chat and every company does have web

302
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,899
chat

303
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,839
so there's a there's a lot of stuff here

304
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,640
um and I guess the last point I want to

305
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,260
put into Beacon standard is it's really

306
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,880
important that this is a definition it

307
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,920
allows us to define something strongly

308
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,019
to set a fact

309
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,000
and for us to be able to set a fact and

310
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,160
reproduce the fact really change to the

311
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
game for interoperability for safety for

312
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,180
security for the security of your

313
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,920
information and for the performance of

314
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,839
our networks so this definition is

315
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,940
really foundational and critical to the

316
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,040
next generation of conversations next

317
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,040
so what are the practical problems we're

318
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,779
solving so General conversation

319
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,360
management like signing and verification

320
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,440
encryption is this a real conversation

321
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,079
has it changed it since uh content

322
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,640
reaction

323
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,700
um uh one of the very interesting things

324
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,500
is the data packing and unpacking you

325
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,700
know you have a conversation it can be

326
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,820
very large and so that conversation can

327
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,680
be carried in one big package where it

328
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,420
can be referenced externally depending

329
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,860
upon your scenario and the way you

330
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,660
convert between the two it should be it

331
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,240
should be a defined thing

332
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,880
um from my own you know uh my

333
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,579
professional purposes as a as a guy

334
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,320
who's running this department

335
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,899
um you know I have a responsibility to

336
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,060
my customers to protect their data I

337
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,680
have responsibility to my shareholders

338
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,480
to give them the Insight that they that

339
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,300
they need the vcon allows me to manage

340
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,480
both sides of my responsibilities uh and

341
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,740
um in in and that can't be more um you

342
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,779
know emphasized here that this is really

343
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,220
where we sit in the world that really

344
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,139
that real tension between the

345
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,279
intelligence of what we're trying to do

346
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,019
and the privacy of what we need to

347
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:34,860
maintain

348
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,760
so next

349
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,420
so here's the status

350
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,040
um so the vcom python library is now

351
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,180
available

352
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,639
um it does life cycle support

353
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,200
um uh this is the way I have to do next

354
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,100
we have to work on the life cycle

355
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,300
support

356
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,920
um redaction amendments but otherwise

357
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,620
it's a fully functioning uh Library uh

358
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,779
we have a vcom server we call it the con

359
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,639
server because it's funny

360
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,899
um it's basically a database for

361
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,459
conversations you can put a conversation

362
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,440
there and get it back later you know you

363
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
can get it back for dacted it puts it

364
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,500
all in one place we've already

365
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,240
integrated to six different kinds of

366
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,760
communication services to prove out that

367
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,399
the modes work between the two places

368
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,000
um from from cusing to chatting to um to

369
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
uh email

370
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,899
um and we've also integrated with three

371
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,880
different analysis engines

372
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,120
um open AIS whisper a commercial offer

373
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,040
by Deep Graham and citigroup's data

374
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,800
profiler we did that in the the um uh

375
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,180
the hackathon so we're looking for

376
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,800
comments and suggestions

377
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,620
um we need a volunteer to uh chair the

378
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,839
bar buff you don't have to it says it's

379
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,519
a Thursday night I'm sure you've heard

380
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,920
my call for for drinking well if you are

381
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,360
if you're the volunteer at a chair you

382
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,980
don't have to pay so don't don't don't

383
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,480
worry about that

384
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,320
um

385
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,240
um and so uh we do have some current

386
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,980
discussions going on around is Json the

387
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,779
right type I think actually at Json is

388
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,339
absolutely the right type um for

389
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,959
interchange for the application layer

390
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,459
it's really the big thing if you're

391
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,920
trying to draw a line between the bottom

392
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,019
and the top Json is the thing which

393
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,980
allows us to draw that line uh binary

394
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,260
um formats aren't appropriate for

395
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,680
application web app guys so

396
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,420
that's what I got

397
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,519
thank you thanks so much for presenting

398
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,380
Thomas and sharing your work with us

399
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,540
here we've put um this slide with just

400
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,920
more information there's a mailing list

401
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,680
but I'd invite the room or um virtual

402
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,540
participants as well to join the queue

403
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,240
and we're looking here for a dispatch

404
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,579
outcome so if you think that there is

405
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:30,959
interest if you would be interested in

406
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,000
working on this problem if you've read

407
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,620
the drafts you have any questions or

408
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,060
thoughts about where it should go yeah

409
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,560
and well I'm sorry one that's

410
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,480
interesting the white paper that we have

411
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,880
a reference to here was the result of

412
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,560
half a dozen of us

413
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,899
um putting some work together trying to

414
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,480
illuminate the the opportunities in

415
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,699
terms of privacy and AI in the market

416
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,800
it's a 25-page white paper

417
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,660
um and it's it's really deep if you'd

418
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,339
like to really understand what we're

419
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:57,540
looking at for problems it's a good

420
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,620
place to start

421
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,660
great thank you so much so in the

422
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,180
virtual queue we have Ted Hardy

423
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,540
um who's also in person as well hi Ted

424
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,839
uh hello uh 1030 Cisco um thanks for the

425
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,660
presentation uh you're welcome

426
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,160
I think from a dispatch point of view

427
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,600
that this would have to go to above it's

428
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,240
a chewy large scale piece of work

429
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,459
um and I think at that buff we would

430
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,260
probably want to tackle a very

431
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,600
fundamental question well before do we

432
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,760
do Json with this in and that is is this

433
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,440
the right Lego piece

434
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,600
typically in the ietf we build building

435
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,000
blocks and I think what you're actually

436
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,540
looking at is something that's partially

437
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,480
built from other building blocks so if

438
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,399
you were going to model this with like a

439
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,959
full ontology you would say this is

440
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,720
actually an utterance and this utterance

441
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,940
has those identity properties and other

442
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,040
properties that you were describing and

443
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,139
the linkage of different utterances into

444
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,300
either a Time sequence or to a set of

445
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,240
exchanges is what you're calling a

446
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,459
conversation but you can easily imagine

447
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,920
this set of utterances being used in a

448
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,779
different kind of Corpus right so if you

449
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,059
created this and said actually what I

450
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,679
want to do with this is to see all of

451
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,439
the utterances by this particular

452
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,119
identity across

453
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,760
a series of conversations because maybe

454
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,640
what I'm looking for is an analytical

455
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,919
pattern of uh harassment or something

456
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,359
like that

457
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,819
um your focus on the conversation is I

458
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,079
think

459
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,119
um useful for the business case you you

460
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,319
put forward and I certainly understand

461
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,179
why you did it that way but I think if

462
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,260
we're going to build building blocks

463
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,880
here we we might actually have to go

464
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,220
back a step and say what are the

465
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,900
building blocks that actually go into

466
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,660
this so that you have these set of

467
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,700
utterances that can be either exchanges

468
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,740
or other kinds of corpuses

469
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,440
and go from there and so I really

470
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,000
encourage you as you're as you're

471
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,700
looking at this to kind of back up a

472
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,039
step and say if we're going to run a

473
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,840
buff what is it we're actually asking

474
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,820
people to build and how many pieces are

475
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,740
there because I think some of what

476
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,120
you're describing

477
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,860
if you take it from that perspective

478
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,080
some of the privacy considerations that

479
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,320
you have will expand a good bit

480
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,299
um and some of that question you have

481
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,059
about whether or not the identity

482
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,120
framework is suitable if you're looking

483
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,179
at it from a single interchange where

484
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,059
you're one party may be quite different

485
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,860
if you're looking at it from a a

486
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,600
different perspective so thank you very

487
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,900
much I appreciate that and I and um you

488
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,240
know I I I I thought the same thing too

489
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,799
I was I was in the same place there and

490
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,179
I think we can do more work with that

491
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,400
and I I understand that but what I found

492
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,620
was that when you took The Primitives

493
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,600
that we already have the the stuff we've

494
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,460
already done in art

495
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,940
um they roughly represent the um the

496
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,620
elements that are the composite that

497
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,940
we're putting together

498
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,380
but from the

499
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,240
but from the other side if you think

500
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,340
about it from a system diagram that

501
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,720
actual component that we're thinking

502
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,880
about is externally referenced not from

503
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,960
the application layer but from

504
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,299
regulations from the vendor side from

505
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,820
the bottom to the top it does transform

506
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,140
ourselves right into the entire

507
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,140
ecosystem and so because I think it's we

508
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,820
do have a lot of um

509
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,740
uh requirements on that one particular

510
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,960
component that's what brought me to

511
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,020
there but I think I I agree with you I I

512
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,580
thought that through okay thank you very

513
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,320
much just a reminder people in the room

514
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,760
if you're going to join the queue please

515
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,580
join on the meets Echo Lite client and

516
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,200
then get up to the mic so I'm calling

517
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,880
from the virtual queue so we're all in

518
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,220
order so um you can immediately see

519
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,840
people add themselves thank you so

520
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,220
Jonathan Rosenberg you're up next

521
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,080
that's me I you probably need to put

522
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,340
yourself in the virtual queue if you

523
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,740
want to speak uh all right I'm happy or

524
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,260
you can go all right Jonathan Rosenberg

525
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,880
um I'm from five nine actually we're a

526
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,100
cloud contact center provider so this is

527
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,440
pretty relevant to my day job

528
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,440
um I have two comments for you one is uh

529
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,299
one is should go to a buff I think

530
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,580
there's there's a lot here

531
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,799
um the second thing I would say is one

532
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,660
of the things I find is unclear and

533
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,720
would be valuable from the buff is who

534
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,400
is this meant to be exchanged between

535
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,380
like what's missing is the system

536
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,419
diagram of like oh industry problem

537
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,480
today is vendor a makes product a and

538
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,000
vendor B makes product B and today

539
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,679
there's no standard and that helps

540
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,620
qualify the requirements I look at this

541
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,539
for example and I I thought it was maybe

542
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,820
trying to solve a different problem uh

543
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,799
in my business which is we have two

544
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,840
vendors today that the contact center

545
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,880
provider that has the calls and the

546
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,720
chats

547
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,580
and the quality management people who

548
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,020
like get access to that for like people

549
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,000
listen to the recordings and stuff and

550
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,919
this format is insufficient as defined

551
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,720
today for that exchange so maybe that's

552
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,580
not the problem you're solving yeah I

553
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,780
don't know what the problem is so

554
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,000
clarifying the scope of what's the

555
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,160
participants that you want to change

556
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,020
this between so we can scope out the

557
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,580
what should be in this thing and not

558
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,620
that would be my suggestion thank you JD

559
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,500
I appreciate that and and um and there's

560
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
the white paper the 25 page dense white

561
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,700
paper is a compendium of 15 use cases

562
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,380
um and I think the challenge is exactly

563
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,480
that how do we how do we boil it down to

564
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,700
the use case that we can hang our Bob

565
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,740
hats on write a draft with the use cases

566
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,860
yeah great thank you good advice thank

567
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,720
you very much okay up next in the queue

568
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,360
we have Robert steppenak hello Robert

569
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,640
stepanek FastMail so at the risk of bike

570
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,440
shedding I just wanted to say that I

571
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,660
found the name vikon quite confusing

572
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,299
especially since you're in the

573
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,820
introduction referring to vCard

574
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,000
um I'm working a lot with these formats

575
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,220
and they they have nothing to do with

576
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,360
Json right so um I found it very I had

577
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,760
this this mental gap between sure thing

578
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,580
called V something and then coming in a

579
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,140
very different format than data mode

580
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,020
yeah that's a good comment and and um it

581
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,480
by the way it started as a joke

582
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,159
um we were designing

583
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,020
um and we realized we had this

584
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,659
conversation object and my co-designer

585
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,400
said too bad we don't have V cards for

586
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,640
conversations we should call it a b con

587
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,900
and that's that's where it came from the

588
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,640
lot from The Logical level it's like a v

589
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,200
card but it's for Commerce PDF for

590
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,240
conversations that was the idea but you

591
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,520
I think I'll take that comment as well

592
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,500
if you have a better name I'm all ears

593
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,080
thank you I mean you can take a g on in

594
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,520
front of it but it's yeah that's right

595
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,520
very original that's disgusting okay up

596
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,320
in the queue next it's Eric Chris Corner

597
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,299
uh yeah hi

598
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,400
um I have no opinion the name

599
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,940
um uh on the process um as people said

600
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,460
this needs to go to above clearly um um

601
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,260
I think from my perspective the

602
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,700
requisite for a buff would be a pretty

603
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,559
clear problem statement document and use

604
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,419
cases document not a requirements

605
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,620
document but simply talking about laid

606
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,640
out this problem space so people

607
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,260
understand what we're trying to solve

608
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,299
um protocol is fine um as an input to

609
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,559
that but like it's very harder version

610
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,640
engineer where the problem statement is

611
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,140
out of the protocol so I think the Play

612
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,520
Store would be that

613
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,179
um

614
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,340
um and I think you know um just just to

615
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,840
just to preview this the standard for

616
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,400
working group will be like why levels of

617
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,679
interest in terms of doing this so um I

618
00:22:58,679 --> 00:22:59,760
would incur I would strongly encourage

619
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,900
you on once you have that problem

620
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,340
statement to shop it around to people

621
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,320
who um other vendors like maybe Jonathan

622
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,400
or other people like him who might be

623
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,659
interested in implementing and see if

624
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,220
they are so that you have

625
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,480
um some evidence that that will be the

626
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,059
case okay thanks anchor appreciate that

627
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,400
thank you for the input okay next in the

628
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,260
kids Martin Thompson yeah Martin

629
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,740
Thompson uh when when Ted got up and

630
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,600
started talking about ontologies and

631
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,220
utterances

632
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,780
um uh I'm I'm gonna say that um that

633
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,299
made me think that maybe a boss

634
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,760
is not exactly the right place to do

635
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,260
this sort of thing

636
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,220
um

637
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,659
and I largely agree with the things that

638
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,580
other people have said about forming

639
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,140
this the sort of constituency around

640
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,900
this and working on making sure that the

641
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,120
requirements and use cases are very very

642
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,980
clearly articulated but I'm going to

643
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,320
suggest that maybe the w3c might be

644
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,600
interested in this work they have

645
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,400
reached out actually they have reached

646
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,159
out and just just to say how we got here

647
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,200
versus the w3c

648
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,700
um we believe that there were enough

649
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,740
privacy and security requirements and

650
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,120
this was coming up from the bottom of

651
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,820
the stack enough that it was probably

652
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,200
more appropriate to have it as part of

653
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
the plumbing than the than the toilet

654
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,980
joke

655
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,320
um but you know what I mean I think I

656
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,580
think it's more than the basement than

657
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,640
the Attic So yeah so this this may be

658
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,820
one of those cases where a joint uh that

659
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,200
might be enterprised is what you're

660
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,580
looking for sure

661
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,320
um I don't know enough about the details

662
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,179
to to really be able to say that but it

663
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,580
seems like there's a lot of work that

664
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,380
that is very much at a higher layer

665
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,580
tying all of these sorts of things

666
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,919
together and and describing things like

667
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,760
uh data models and and those sorts of

668
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,980
other things on top of it whereas yes it

669
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,140
does have a lot of things again it is

670
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,940
clear in the again the 25 page white

671
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,220
paper just how applicable it is to so

672
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,659
many different places so that's very

673
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,360
very true okay man thank you thank you

674
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,860
very much what a memorable phrase just

675
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,659
kick the week off

676
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,580
um so we have next in the queue Helen

677
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,659
Jennings

678
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,539
uh Colin Jennings

679
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:04,260
um oh so dispatch of course I've been on

680
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,940
dispatch topic obviously both but what I

681
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,559
want to say is this above this would be

682
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,179
very interesting to us particularly in

683
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:10,919
the use case so Colin James with Cisco

684
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,260
and you're very interested in the use

685
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,840
cases that help us manage uh machine

686
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,039
learning data that we're using for

687
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,700
training and stuff uh I also also I'm uh

688
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,640
Cisco's AC rep for w3c so fairly

689
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,140
familiar stuff with what's going on

690
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,120
there with semantic web if this is going

691
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,520
to be done on top of somatic web I I'm

692
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,380
pretty much 100 sure we will totally

693
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,679
ignore it and have nothing to do with it

694
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,880
and he's gone okay thank you

695
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,799
um so just noting time I'd encourage

696
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,360
anyone to join the queue if you think a

697
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,100
buff is not the way forward after some

698
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,020
clarification and problem statements and

699
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,760
use case drafts put together possibly

700
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,220
with the liaison on w3c so if you

701
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,840
strongly disagree with that looks like

702
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,520
where the dispatch is going so please

703
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,620
join the queue if you disagree

704
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,000
um Jonathan Rosenberg you're up next

705
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,980
yeah Jonathan Rosenberg five nine again

706
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,740
uh I I wouldn't I don't think that w3c

707
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,779
thing makes sense just in terms of venue

708
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,059
um largely because uh this is like

709
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,919
telephony stuff a lot of the folks who

710
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,539
are here are familiar with the type of

711
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,580
problems uh there's been a lot of

712
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,980
historic work at five nine on like call

713
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,960
detail records and stuff of which this

714
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,419
is a successor in many ways so I think

715
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:20,940
ITF is fine and it should be a buff so

716
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,220
thank you thank you thank you very much

717
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,860
okay with no one else in the queue all

718
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,059
we have to do is say thank you very much

719
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,940
Thomas thank you for your time thank you

720
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,500
thank you

721
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,860
Stella start to your first ITF as well

722
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,679
okay so next on the agenda we have Rick

723
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,419
van rein who's presenting on Sasol

724
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,500
authentication for sip

725
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,720
yeah hello

726
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,760
um this is something I ran into recently

727
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,220
on a crossroad of two sorts of work I

728
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,159
was doing and I'm closer to the bank

729
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,740
um um this is something I ran into on a

730
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,299
crossroad of two lines of work I was

731
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,860
working on

732
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,779
um and it looks like it's very general

733
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,880
and might in general be useful for other

734
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,740
purpose as well so I'm here basically to

735
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,659
bounce off the question is this valuable

736
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,580
enough to put into a specification into

737
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,900
formalize

738
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,659
so if I could have the first line

739
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,100
so normally

740
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,919
um what I'm doing is trying to get

741
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:18,659
mechanism for realm crossover meaning

742
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:22,200
some domain owner States user identity

743
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,760
under under this domain and other

744
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,640
domains anywhere in the world can find a

745
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,100
trust relationship based on the DNS

746
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,260
again that sort of thing to get to the

747
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,299
identity provider get the user out and

748
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:34,919
use it in their own protocol as an

749
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,260
authenticated identity so that's what I

750
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,539
call realm crossover

751
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,700
um and it just ends up being a user

752
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,640
domain name sort of identity so it's all

753
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,740
pretty much in line with ITF standards

754
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,600
and I always try to adhere to those as

755
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,159
much as possible we hardly have to make

756
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,080
changes next slide please

757
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:57,960
and the sense of the the integration of

758
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,820
Realm Grove with Cecil is actually the

759
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,279
most uh most likely to be used just

760
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,799
anywhere because it's assassins isn't

761
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,380
part of so many protocols there are a

762
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,059
few where it's a bit painful that it

763
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,039
doesn't have such so one of them is HTTP

764
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,380
for which I will be proposing a social

765
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,400
embedding next Friday in hpbs group but

766
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,020
for sip which inherits most

767
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,720
authentication mechanisms from HTTP it

768
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,400
may also make a lot of sense so this was

769
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,039
a general idea that I had and it might

770
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,419
actually help a lot because the

771
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:28,799
authentication mechanisms can be

772
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,900
flexibly selected so they're not as

773
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,740
rigid as as digest alone for example in

774
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,799
sip and it can do things like Channel

775
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,919
binding that's a bit special is it but

776
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,620
um this can be very useful I can do

777
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,120
things like Mutual authentication which

778
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,799
might be very useful in telephony

779
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,299
because you want to know the caller and

780
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:49,799
the colleague they both need to be

781
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,200
authenticated and there are mechanisms

782
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,240
in Sasol that do that like Kerberos and

783
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,000
recently opaque was defined or it's

784
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,400
being defined at this moment

785
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,100
um and you might have something

786
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,779
um you have shared credentials for

787
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,700
authentication many of the mechanisms

788
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,980
and they allow you to derive symmetrices

789
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,260
that might be integrated with DV

790
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,940
homework key exchange so you have a post

791
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,919
Quantum mechanism of sharing a key

792
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,960
between the endpoints and I think that's

793
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,179
very valuable next slide please

794
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,039
so

795
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,260
um this isn't the first approach to

796
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,779
authentication or security intercepts so

797
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,720
I need to look at the context digest is

798
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,200
the the standard mechanism means sip

799
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,880
um it's pretty much

800
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,880
um a minimum solution but you always

801
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,679
need to have a password in two places so

802
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,059
it's not going to work if you're going

803
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,100
to call someone in another domain like a

804
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,620
user at a domain name somewhere else and

805
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,140
you haven't talked to them before TLS is

806
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,120
an often seen suggestion

807
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,880
um DLS however IN Zip is only half

808
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,059
functional because it's only sip is

809
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:00,419
passed route from from proxy to proxy

810
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,120
and only the the step The Hop between

811
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,820
two proxies is being protected by TLS so

812
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,980
it can't do end-to-end cryptography and

813
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,539
especially they'll derived end-to-end

814
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:13,080
keys with the best privacy possible

815
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,840
um stir might be an opportunity but stir

816
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,539
uh limits itself to phone numbers

817
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,820
so the passport sister or certificates

818
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,580
that only uh Register phone numbers

819
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,679
and certificates in general tend to be

820
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,140
very flexible in terms of data but they

821
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,419
are very static in terms of protocols so

822
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,880
you can't have new flexible Innovations

823
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,179
in cryptography like using oblique prf

824
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,279
for example you can't have that when you

825
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,779
use certificates and they tend to be

826
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,720
public key based so they're also

827
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,080
slightly um dangerous when it comes to

828
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,580
Quantum crypto

829
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,220
uh Quantum computing

830
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,559
um also many of these Solutions are

831
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,720
specific for ship then and it means you

832
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,820
can't have one credential that can be

833
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,740
used over many protocols which is one of

834
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,059
the things we are trying to do as well

835
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,980
and if you have Sasol you can use the

836
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,600
many protocols and you can use the same

837
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,000
identity provided for the same user and

838
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,080
domain name

839
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,158
our next slide please

840
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,399
so the other I said this was work on a

841
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,080
crossroad I'm working on something else

842
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,440
that brings us up actively suddenly as

843
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,240
I'm trying to use sip which is for

844
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,159
session initiation it's normally used

845
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,740
for media sessions but I'm using this

846
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,779
for why I got because why God sends

847
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:31,020
encrypted packets of UDP and perfectly

848
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,779
suitable to set up UDP internals as

849
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:36,840
standards for that and basically what

850
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,740
you do is you set up a UDP or UDP word

851
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,260
instead of

852
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,600
RTP saavp for example you give a port

853
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,880
number and then you give a man type that

854
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,059
could in this case be application

855
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,380
vnd.wireguard you can give parameters

856
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,200
which might involve a public key of a

857
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,240
party you're talking to and it might

858
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,340
include something that refers to public

859
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,940
uh appreciate key derivation method and

860
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,320
that's particularly interesting because

861
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,480
why a guard is very good with

862
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,159
diffie-hellman stuff that's where the

863
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,440
public key is there but it can also mix

864
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,620
in appreciate key to thwart quantum

865
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,840
computers and to be a to be Quantum

866
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,520
proof

867
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,200
um so that's a very desirable method but

868
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,460
of course you don't want to quote the

869
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,620
key there you want to State a method and

870
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,240
what I'm interested in is putting

871
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,399
something there that says derivative key

872
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,440
from assessable authentication using

873
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,120
whatever credentials were used in there

874
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,279
so that both ends know nobody in between

875
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:34,740
knows it so this is where the crossroads

876
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,380
Junction is could have the next slide

877
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,559
please

878
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,500
so this is what HTTP sensor looks like

879
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,179
that's what I will be presenting next

880
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,679
Friday

881
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:47,279
um

882
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,559
basically you get a 401 or a four or

883
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,960
four or seven error it has a WWE

884
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,500
authenticate uh uh a header and it

885
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,179
mentions that realm of which log and

886
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:58,860
that's just like with that GS2 basic

887
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,260
authentication and it lists a number of

888
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,240
magnets for Samsung and it might include

889
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,240
a token that allows state to be passed

890
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,940
back and forth with protection of course

891
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,039
and then when the client answers it will

892
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,140
send author authorization with a

893
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,120
mechanism Choice

894
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,519
um serve to server token and if it

895
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,320
already has a trying to surface token it

896
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,140
will add a c2s feel as well and they can

897
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,640
can go back and forth through a few

898
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,919
bounces and that's how you can embed

899
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,380
Sasol in HTTP

900
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,419
um and the sips hustle is just a

901
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:31,860
derivative from that because sip

902
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,899
inheritance authentication from HTTP

903
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:37,140
next slide please

904
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,899
so there are a few things that differ

905
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:43,320
um with HTTP Central and zip cycle and

906
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,059
one of them is that both the from and

907
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,340
the two identity will have to be

908
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,399
validated at least the address

909
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,779
um so you want to have mutual

910
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,760
authentication mechanisms well Satchel

911
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,100
offers several of those

912
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,720
um if possible you want to derive

913
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,460
end-to-end Keys that's not something

914
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,100
currently done is as early in Social

915
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,140
stencil security layer and in general

916
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,059
there can be all sorts of things so this

917
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,520
can be defined encryption is the common

918
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,918
option that sort of deprecated nowadays

919
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,440
but key derivation in general I think

920
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,899
has a great a great future ahead of it

921
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,020
is in light of quantum computers coming

922
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,000
up

923
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,739
um you we want all the entropy we can

924
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,940
have right and especially when it's

925
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,520
end-to-end entropy

926
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,800
um Channel binding is a nice nice

927
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,780
feature here and you would use that to

928
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,060
bind in the sdp contents that contain

929
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,639
the public key as well as the preset key

930
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,560
and then automatic automatically you

931
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,540
know that you're trusting the right

932
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,460
public key so it's like an instant

933
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,379
certificate

934
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:46,500
um and well not all Sasso mechanisms are

935
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,679
suitable because TLS protects one Trend

936
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,500
one hop it gets decrypted and passed on

937
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,480
in encrypted format so the intermediate

938
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,099
value should be safe for anyone who's

939
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:57,599
sitting there in the middle so you can't

940
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,940
use Cecil mechanisms that are not safe

941
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,339
to pass over plain text plain text login

942
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,380
for example with a plain password

943
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,380
but again Sasso offers choices there no

944
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,220
problem

945
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,680
so um is that an excellent I'm not sure

946
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,720
anymore no I don't think so so there's

947
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,900
the idea um that I came across um from a

948
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,940
background of Realm crossover running

949
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,760
into the idea of using ship for work why

950
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,000
it got set up and I realized hey Sasso

951
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,339
for ship might be a very good idea I'd

952
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,200
like to hear opinions about that

953
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,700
great thank you very much Rick for

954
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,839
presenting I should have said this is

955
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,060
your first ITF as well so great to have

956
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,339
you here and speaking to us so first in

957
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:36,839
the queue

958
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:39,000
um was John sorry I took myself out of

959
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,740
the queue as I stood up using should I

960
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,200
wait until you you call me no go for it

961
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,119
first of all welcome thanks for

962
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,320
presenting this

963
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,920
um

964
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,720
I think it was probably about 10 years

965
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,119
ago I think somebody did Pitch this I'm

966
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,599
pretty sure for sip then and I mean you

967
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,040
know for better for worse we've kind of

968
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,940
come up with a set of security

969
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,460
Primitives we think work for sip at this

970
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,260
point except like because of the

971
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,300
commercial imperatives of the people

972
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,760
that are doing you know HTTP and TLS

973
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,740
primarily as the security things we can

974
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,740
get operators to do we've kind of had to

975
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,359
like you know cook with the ingredients

976
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,820
we have and stir is a great example of

977
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,380
how we kind of cook with the ingredients

978
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,180
we have and of the things that you've

979
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,220
identified here is kind of the gaps in

980
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,859
sip security that Sasol might Rectify I

981
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:23,940
think we've actually managed a couple

982
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,099
most of those together with stir at this

983
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:29,640
point so it's kind of a tough sell I

984
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,020
think at this point to like look at

985
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,720
something like this

986
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,400
sorry so what was the dispatch

987
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,000
recommendation uh to dispatch it in the

988
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,119
dispatch sets no action okay not to stay

989
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,400
the way forward thank you Rick do you

990
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,660
want to respond

991
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,880
um yeah if there is documentation Awards

992
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,800
was discussed 10 years ago without me

993
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,359
knowing then I would very much like to

994
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,980
see that uh if you could send me an

995
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,359
email or something it would be greatly

996
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:55,980
appreciated

997
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,020
uh error prescola

998
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,760
um I I make several points but I'll open

999
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,000
with the dispatch which is uh no action

1000
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,339
um I do not think this is going to go

1001
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,200
um but um now I'll make some actual

1002
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,760
substantive points

1003
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,380
um so first as I mentioned in my email

1004
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,180
to you um the place I would start with

1005
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,220
does anyone want to do this

1006
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,540
um not do you want to do it but is

1007
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,680
anyone who actually operates a real

1008
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,660
system want to do this and if the answer

1009
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,220
is no then it doesn't matter technology

1010
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,780
is simply irrelevant to this question I

1011
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,880
wouldn't mind working on this no um I'm

1012
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,099
already doing for HTTP and I think it's

1013
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,960
fair I don't mean I don't mean what I'm

1014
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,700
saying is has anyone has a deployed Zip

1015
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,419
system want this

1016
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,740
um yeah yeah for the one for the Weigel

1017
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,020
stuff I think it's got a pretty good use

1018
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,859
case

1019
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,619
no you're making a case out of here what

1020
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:41,940
what I'm saying is anybody have a

1021
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,859
deployed system want to do it a person

1022
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,119
who actually operates a big system

1023
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,440
um okay when you when you're when you

1024
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,000
have a protocol yeah and you're

1025
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,400
producing a protocol that is fits into a

1026
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,619
deployed infrastructure the question is

1027
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,119
do people actually have that deployed

1028
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,099
infrastructure want it and if they don't

1029
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,180
it doesn't matter how good the protocol

1030
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,400
is and so my question is does anybody

1031
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,680
who operates a does anybody operates a

1032
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,660
big wire guard system is any anybody who

1033
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,760
operates want to use sip does anybody

1034
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,380
operates a big sip to left any system

1035
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,940
want to use Cecile if the answer this

1036
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,920
question is no then the technical

1037
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,140
mirrors do not matter so does anybody

1038
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,640
who operates one of these systems want

1039
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,879
this

1040
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,020
thank you

1041
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,880
for Wireshark there are currently no

1042
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,160
mechanisms for setting it up

1043
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,760
okay so this adds a new venue I think

1044
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,339
yeah but you're I'll try one more time

1045
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,560
you're making a merits case but I'm

1046
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,760
saying something different let's say I'm

1047
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,619
asking a market question

1048
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,540
okay you're making a case that this is

1049
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,760
good which is fine but my question is

1050
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,560
anybody want it because we don't

1051
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,579
standardize things that people don't

1052
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:45,480
want

1053
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,520
and so my question is does anybody who

1054
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,220
operates wire guard or a basic system

1055
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,140
want this

1056
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,119
okay I'll I will take that question and

1057
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,040
look around if people are interested I

1058
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,060
think that's what you're saying right

1059
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,980
yeah for me now but take this question

1060
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,599
with you that is a preparatory question

1061
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,700
to doing any work here on the technical

1062
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,599
side

1063
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,040
um I think this actually misunderstands

1064
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,240
the security situation around sip

1065
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,680
someone

1066
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,260
um the um as John says we have cobbled

1067
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,640
together a set of mechanisms which work

1068
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,400
and largely rely on Hapa hyper

1069
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,040
encryption followed by end to end

1070
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,920
um message Integrity via signatures um

1071
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,079
which was star is obviously

1072
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,839
um and um so um to the center which one

1073
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,460
is to satisfied with the types of

1074
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,619
identities which stir provides I.E phone

1075
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,420
numbers the right way to do this is to

1076
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,400
extend those identity sets by providing

1077
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,839
credentials that mapping into the

1078
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,400
signature system

1079
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,320
um that would go along with stir not by

1080
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,760
not by replacing with entirely new set

1081
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,359
of mechanisms

1082
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:45,060
um you've mentioned on the the main list

1083
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,980
it would be very nice to store were

1084
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,640
extended to domain uh uh uses and I

1085
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,200
think that would be another venue that

1086
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,180
might be very interesting

1087
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,440
right I think that would be I think I

1088
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,579
think if they said to which you're

1089
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,500
dissatisfied with phone number type

1090
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,060
identification for sip that would be the

1091
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,859
way to fix the problem yeah I would not

1092
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,660
be satisfied with that I won't use the

1093
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,820
said domain names sure um and then once

1094
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,380
again I'll simply say does anybody who

1095
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,119
operates a sip system want you to have

1096
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,859
domain names

1097
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,839
okay well thank you part of presenting

1098
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,460
it dispatch is to find people who do

1099
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,140
want the work as well so if you are

1100
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,400
interested in this book please come up

1101
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,960
to the mic and voice your opinion there

1102
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,040
as well

1103
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,540
um Cullen Jennings you're next in the

1104
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,779
queue

1105
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,420
okay Colin Jay's good

1106
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,079
um

1107
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,660
I I one of the things that this is a

1108
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,540
technical comment about it uh

1109
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,000
one of the levels when you're talking

1110
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,339
about end-to-end security with SIP is

1111
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:40,260
inherently a hot by hot protocol that's

1112
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,540
used to set up an inbuyan thing and your

1113
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,579
VPN in this case is the End by end in

1114
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:47,280
thing you may actually want to do the

1115
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,020
level of authentication you're trying to

1116
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,540
achieve in the security you want on top

1117
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,359
of the the VPN layer instead of on top

1118
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,820
of the Hop inherently hot by hop um

1119
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,380
thing so that would just be one

1120
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,300
recommendation I would have to to think

1121
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,060
a little bit about

1122
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,280
um you know how you're how you're

1123
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,660
skinning this cat and whether you're

1124
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,400
using a potato peeler or if there's a

1125
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,460
different place you can skin it thanks

1126
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,040
okay thank you um I was starting from

1127
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,660
wireguard and trying to make the best

1128
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,920
out of that and what you're saying is

1129
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,380
maybe why God needs some work then

1130
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,440
I I I I I don't have a strong opinion of

1131
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,820
which way it would be yes but I think it

1132
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,320
would be really worth considering both

1133
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,300
those architectural ways of doing it

1134
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,680
thank you clear

1135
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,140
thank you Anthony somersets hi Anthony

1136
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,740
Somerset liquid um we operate a

1137
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,180
large-scale voice Network

1138
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,820
um I'm a little bit confused about what

1139
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,440
we're trying to solve we're trying to

1140
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,920
fix authenticating caller ID versus the

1141
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,880
from and the two or the actual caller is

1142
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,060
you know this is a person on this

1143
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,300
endpoint and they've been authenticated

1144
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,920
um because they're two they're two

1145
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,740
different things with two different

1146
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,780
mechanisms to manage and as the as

1147
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,820
Cullen was saying it's hot by hop on sip

1148
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,740
because you have to make routing

1149
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,700
decisions

1150
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,579
which means you have to know that data

1151
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,579
so it can kind of the Privacy gets a bit

1152
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,440
murky

1153
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,640
um so I'm just struggling to understand

1154
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,859
what are we trying to solve here and I

1155
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,260
do want to Echo you know authenticate

1156
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,940
the network layer as much as you can

1157
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,980
first before we have to deal with

1158
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,500
getting into it that being said I'd be

1159
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,060
very interested in seeing an alternative

1160
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,700
to digest because it is more secure in

1161
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,520
terms of authenticating an endpoint

1162
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,560
um might be difficult from a network to

1163
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,200
network interrupt perspective though

1164
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,520
yeah

1165
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,160
um what I'm what I'm into here is uh

1166
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,680
making cross domain calls possible with

1167
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,359
authentication end-to-end so the from

1168
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,040
and the two identities are the things

1169
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,079
I'm concerned about but what you are

1170
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,520
saying is instead of digest you might

1171
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,380
register for example settle and that's

1172
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,720
the second idea I have had that might be

1173
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,720
a general use case so thank you for

1174
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,280
stating that you would like to see a

1175
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,980
replacement for Digest

1176
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,560
thank you John Peterson John again just

1177
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,240
uh I wasn't really going to go into the

1178
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,700
technical details but I will just a

1179
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,380
little bit just so I think we're clear

1180
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,940
about what the Baseline is of sips

1181
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,579
existing security features so stir is by

1182
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:15,839
no means limited telephone numbers

1183
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,119
actually it solves for user at domain

1184
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,859
just as well that was true of its

1185
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:22,800
predecessor spec RFC 4474 as well stir

1186
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,319
negotiates Keys end to end it has an m

1187
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:26,940
key parameter and passport that lets you

1188
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,740
sign the media keys to present in sdp

1189
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,680
and you know if you're concerned about

1190
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,440
securing the to and from it's basically

1191
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,819
like the best practice right because

1192
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:37,800
usually those are not domains controlled

1193
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,500
by the end users right and like having

1194
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,500
King material down in the user agents is

1195
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,140
not actually typically useful at all for

1196
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,599
being able to figure out like who should

1197
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:51,960
attest to the you know the validity of

1198
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,400
the two in the parameter fields in set

1199
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,040
and so I mean I I think it's that the

1200
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,720
you know it's more fundamental it's the

1201
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,339
the sizzle security model is is

1202
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,619
fundamentally misaligned with the things

1203
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:04,140
sip security actually needs if you want

1204
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,520
to be able to authenticate things like

1205
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,680
the from and two and yes there is even a

1206
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,119
mutual authentication feature there

1207
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,579
first for store now as well so I mean uh

1208
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,380
it's unclear to me what features this

1209
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,020
would offer us beyond that this realm

1210
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,640
crossover obviously the ability to do

1211
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,020
this working with other things but

1212
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,060
people have looked at like oauth for

1213
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,460
that as well so and digest is not the

1214
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,560
only thing that people use by any means

1215
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,060
to figure out how to authenticate

1216
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,740
yourself to your local domain but when

1217
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,480
it's that question of how you figure out

1218
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,240
who the to and from are like having

1219
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,400
interoperable layer for that that's

1220
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,800
going to be cross domain

1221
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,200
um I I think we got that I think we

1222
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,300
probably got that as fixed as it can be

1223
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,520
first up now

1224
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,640
thank you I looked into stir a bit so

1225
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,680
only one RFC might have been that that

1226
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,540
was an early RFC that only mentioned

1227
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,579
there's like 10 maybe 12 at this point

1228
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:55,859
yeah okay I will I will look into that

1229
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,540
thank you thank you for the feedback

1230
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,859
just in the interest of time I'm going

1231
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:00,599
to cut the cue shortly and just to relay

1232
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,180
a comment from Jabba from dkg why God

1233
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,440
deliberately avoids any fancy

1234
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,060
authentication mechanisms for the sake

1235
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,160
of Simplicity and points are identified

1236
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,200
by raw public keys I suspect why our

1237
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,180
guard itself will never adopt fancier

1238
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,920
Earth schemes

1239
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,680
and sorry I didn't I didn't catch it can

1240
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,900
you please repeat uh yeah wire guard

1241
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,940
deliberately avoids any fancy

1242
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,740
authentication mechanisms for the sake

1243
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,380
of Simplicity endpoints are identified

1244
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,140
by raw public keys I suspect that

1245
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,359
wireguard itself will never adopt

1246
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:32,700
fancier authentication schemes just

1247
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,380
relaying a comment from

1248
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,000
I mean you don't have to respond to it

1249
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,980
it's just yeah extra comment I think

1250
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,420
okay

1251
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,460
um Eric bruscola you're next in the line

1252
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,380
yeah so I think it's probably important

1253
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,780
to distinguish between two different

1254
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,880
settings here one setting is

1255
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,980
authenticating the client to the SIP

1256
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,119
server

1257
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,160
um which um which is I think like the

1258
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,720
situation which sassoles canonically

1259
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,220
been used for authenticating you know

1260
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,500
you know I'm not clients to iMac servers

1261
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,000
and that kind of thing on the other is

1262
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,460
end end for the reasons like John laid

1263
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,119
out

1264
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,500
um I think Sasol is like entirely

1265
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,819
inappropriate for the end end question

1266
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:06,839
right

1267
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,339
um it is potentially one might imagine

1268
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:09,660
appropriate for the client silver

1269
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,819
question but my peers who work on this

1270
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,020
tell me that problem has been solved

1271
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,420
without satisfaction so um I think to

1272
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,400
this end to which um you know just just

1273
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,920
from um from noting that you're also

1274
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,020
presenting about Sasol HTTP I sense is

1275
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,640
that you like Cecil um if you're

1276
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,440
interested in having Sasol and sip I

1277
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,540
would focus on the question of how to

1278
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,740
think the simpler question of how do

1279
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,420
they get a client a server if there are

1280
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,640
any gaps in such an area

1281
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,920
yeah okay well there's a very big line

1282
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,119
here of

1283
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:38,819
um looking into the other ways of of

1284
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:42,480
doing things I need to organize

1285
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,000
what is actually needed and if this is

1286
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,859
the solution for that that's very clear

1287
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:49,020
feedback thank you okay thank you that's

1288
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,700
the end of the queue so thanks Rick for

1289
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,160
your time and sharing your work with us

1290
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,020
um the outcome from dispatch is the work

1291
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,640
should not go forward and as current

1292
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,640
form so we're looking down next to the

1293
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,160
agenda enough after heroic Sprint from

1294
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,960
the airport and we've actually got

1295
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,180
Deacon replay back in its original slot

1296
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,640
so it's over to way to present virtually

1297
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,440
and Bron who's with us in the room to

1298
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,079
field any questions you may have so over

1299
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,560
to you

1300
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:21,980
six

1301
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,079
all right can you see me and hear me we

1302
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,060
can see and hear you Highway

1303
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,380
hi

1304
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:32,960
um let's see if I can control the slides

1305
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,760
and actually should I see some sort of

1306
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,619
control

1307
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:39,780
so you should see the slides shipping is

1308
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,480
driving the slides can take no credit

1309
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,640
all right all right

1310
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,680
um good morning everyone my name is Roy

1311
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,980
Trang I'm from Google I'm presenting

1312
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,440
dcom replay problems and possible

1313
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,020
solutions with Brian gondwana from

1314
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,280
FastMail

1315
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,060
next slide

1316
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:03,260
so email authentication uh is defined by

1317
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,619
two standards from the ITF RFC 6376

1318
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:10,980
which is a mechanism to sign and

1319
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,680
authenticate emails another important

1320
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,880
standard for this is our SPF which is

1321
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,839
RFC 7208 which is a mechanism to

1322
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,460
authenticate the uh sending mail server

1323
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,960
replay was described in the dkem RFC in

1324
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,560
section 8.6 as a

1325
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,480
message that can spam message that can

1326
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,700
be sent through a decom signer that

1327
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,859
leverages the reputation of that signer

1328
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:44,880
and then that message can then be resent

1329
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,700
to many victim recipients

1330
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,720
next slide please

1331
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,839
so to describe the mail flow problem

1332
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:58,500
it's important to uh

1333
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,619
characterize it in terms of uh some of

1334
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,780
the flows that we would see so here in

1335
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,700
this uh diagram

1336
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,760
we have a sender that is sending a

1337
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,160
message through a decom signer the top

1338
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,500
line is going to be a message that's

1339
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,260
directly sent to some recipient in that

1340
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,380
case we would expect to see uh

1341
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,800
potentially a deacon pass and an SPF

1342
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,800
pass and they can be aligned the

1343
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,500
receiver would see that as and can

1344
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,480
characterize as a message that's been

1345
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,220
directly sent to it

1346
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,880
now there can be also an indirect flow

1347
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,480
on the bottom where the message is being

1348
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,700
forwarded through potentially a mailing

1349
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,180
list uh a bulk sender and those are

1350
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,640
benign cases or it could also be an

1351
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,260
instance of Decon replay which is

1352
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,680
malicious and here the receiver would

1353
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,900
see a message that would be potentially

1354
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,480
a deacon pass

1355
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,180
potentially also a decim uh sorry SPF

1356
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,760
passed but not aligned or an FP of fail

1357
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,859
and the problem from the receiver's

1358
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:06,599
point of view is very hard for it to

1359
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,599
tell the benign cases from the Deacon

1360
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,339
replay case next slide

1361
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:14,599
um

1362
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:19,500
so in the Deacon replay scenario

1363
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,579
um and well the decom uh what the the

1364
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,339
spam is going to do is uh find a message

1365
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:28,319
that they can send and sign through

1366
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,740
hybrid petitions uh signer and then have

1367
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,700
that uh captured by an account that the

1368
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,300
spammer has access to and then next

1369
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,660
slide

1370
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,780
and then they're going to uh then

1371
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,480
potentially take that message

1372
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,859
potentially modify the message within

1373
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:52,200
the balance of what geekim allows and

1374
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,020
then broadcast that out uh to many many

1375
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,460
recipients uh because they're leveraging

1376
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:02,339
the high reputation signer they can get

1377
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:04,260
their spam to get through the spam

1378
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,460
filters

1379
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,500
and this is a classification problem a

1380
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,119
kind of false negative

1381
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,900
next slide

1382
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:16,859
and the consequence of that is that

1383
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:19,680
these spam messages are going to be seen

1384
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,440
by the spam filter and then it's going

1385
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,020
to cause the reputation of that sign or

1386
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,420
to drop potentially causing a

1387
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,000
deliverability issue for good mail

1388
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,059
that's being sent by that signer and

1389
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:34,619
we're going to see a kind of false

1390
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:36,780
positive now

1391
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,480
what we've seen in Gmail is that while

1392
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,440
DCM replay isn't the highest Source or

1393
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,020
cost of spam that we're seeing it's the

1394
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,819
one that has the most consequences in

1395
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:50,640
terms of deliverability complaints and

1396
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,079
then that's causing a huge amount of

1397
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,839
problems for us and this is one of the

1398
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:56,700
reasons why we're very interested in

1399
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,339
trying to solve this problem

1400
00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:02,460
um we saw this a large increase of

1401
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,119
Deacon replay attacks late in 2021 and

1402
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,000
while it's trying to die down due to a

1403
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,680
number of mitigations folks are putting

1404
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,440
out there in the ecosystem we think that

1405
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,720
they're still a weakness in the

1406
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,280
standards that we would like to see

1407
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,200
fixed

1408
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:19,859
um

1409
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:21,839
the other thing just to reiterate again

1410
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,300
is that from a receiver's perspective

1411
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,099
being able to tell the difference

1412
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:28,440
between benign flows and malicious flow

1413
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,020
is very difficult from from a receiver's

1414
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,339
point of view next slide

1415
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,319
so uh we uh helped put together a deacon

1416
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,540
replay birds of a feather session at MOG

1417
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:46,559
56 in Brooklyn recently in October

1418
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,079
um there were four drafts uh discussed

1419
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:52,500
at that uh buff uh one by kutral one by

1420
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,859
Truong myself uh by Bradshaw and

1421
00:52:55,859 --> 00:52:58,579
gondwana

1422
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:02,339
the outcome of that buff was that we

1423
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:05,599
should try to characterize the problem

1424
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,119
in a draft and then we wrote up a

1425
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,880
problem statement draft that tried to

1426
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,160
characterize some of these uh complex

1427
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,619
voiding flows that characterize modern

1428
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:18,900
male and then the other thing that we

1429
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,220
did was we tried to put these drafts and

1430
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,680
potential other Solutions into a

1431
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,059
taxonomy

1432
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:30,720
and I'll present that next next slide

1433
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,359
so the first solution set of solutions

1434
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,059
is trying to put the envelope recipient

1435
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:39,599
into the signature and this was proposed

1436
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,319
in three of the drafts to try bratra and

1437
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:46,200
chuang uh and

1438
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,480
uh essentially the difference between

1439
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,059
these drafts are that they're going

1440
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:52,859
about uh

1441
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:55,200
putting that signature uh the the

1442
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,780
recipient the envelope recipient in the

1443
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,079
future in different ways so one would uh

1444
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:04,440
have it implicitly done uh is without

1445
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,800
having to change the message itself

1446
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:12,200
another bride trial would take that uh

1447
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,819
hash of the recipient and put that into

1448
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,800
a new header in the message

1449
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,520
and then the draft by Truong would uh

1450
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,020
instead have the uh recipient either

1451
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,140
explicitly disclosed uh with the payload

1452
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,020
headers like the qcc or in some new

1453
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,780
header that would uh

1454
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,079
then be hashed and then uh part of the

1455
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:38,819
signature

1456
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:43,380
um now these uh approaches uh do avoid

1457
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,420
the amplification problem that was

1458
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,240
described earlier in the example uh and

1459
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,859
solved the replay problem that way

1460
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:53,160
however they do run potentially into

1461
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,700
some problems where they may prevent uh

1462
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,140
indirect mail flows much like SPF or if

1463
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,660
they don't so the first you have that

1464
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,220
issue where I think they would be

1465
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,000
impacted by uh in direct flows the third

1466
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,940
draft the trunk draft would uh solve

1467
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,800
that but would do so at increased

1468
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,839
complexity and that will be described

1469
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,700
later next slide

1470
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,640
the second approach in this taxonomy is

1471
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,700
you could count the number of signatures

1472
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,559
and then filter above a certain

1473
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,500
threshold and this was mentioned uh by

1474
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,680
Yahoo and the birds of feather session

1475
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,839
uh as the technique they're using to

1476
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:39,839
great effect however uh

1477
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,000
this will run into issues with mailing

1478
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,700
lists you know

1479
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,920
Exploder aliases or even large number of

1480
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,920
bccs

1481
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,839
as a potential of essentially false

1482
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,300
positives that will get a cut if above

1483
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,099
that threshold

1484
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:59,000
next slide

1485
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:02,640
a third class of solutions could be to

1486
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,619
potentially strip off these detail

1487
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:06,599
signatures so essentially these decom

1488
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,200
signatures would be uh you know SMTP uh

1489
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,380
transactional only so basically signed

1490
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,319
an outbound and then stripped on inbound

1491
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:17,640
uh it's a straw man we don't know of

1492
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,260
anyone using it uh it does uh have the

1493
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,180
problem that is going to have SPF like

1494
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,420
Behavior again and uh you could have a

1495
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,880
malicious uh Mill Forward or that could

1496
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,680
get in the way too

1497
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,380
next slide

1498
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,920
the fourth solution potentially is to

1499
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,059
gather perhaps signatures and also uh

1500
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:45,900
specify the next hop destination domain

1501
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:51,359
uh thereby uh these uh flows are going

1502
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,720
to be much harder to replay because uh

1503
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,480
you know a replayer is going to have a

1504
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,619
hard time uh harder time uh

1505
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,839
taking a message and then re-injected

1506
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,940
back in either that or they basically

1507
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,119
identify themselves as part of the flow

1508
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,480
now uh this of course tolerates voiding

1509
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,819
but it does have additional signing

1510
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:17,400
overhead and two of the graphs uh

1511
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,319
discuss this particular technique the

1512
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:22,079
drawing draft and the gun water draft uh

1513
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,520
this requires that all messages of uh

1514
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,920
all hops I should say of a mess a

1515
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,200
message path is going to have to

1516
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,720
participate in this protocol

1517
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,380
um either that or the message may be

1518
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,280
identified is uh going outside of a path

1519
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,200
but messages going outside of the path

1520
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,300
it won't be possible to determine

1521
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,920
whether or not the message is being

1522
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:52,319
Deacon well being replayed or uh or some

1523
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,020
benign flow uh the other thing I should

1524
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,339
point out the difference between these

1525
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:59,520
two drafts is the trunk draft uh uses

1526
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,220
Arc as infrastructure the gondwano draft

1527
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,619
proposes using new headers that are

1528
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:06,839
going to be very arc-like

1529
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,619
next slide

1530
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,240
so what should we do well the proposal

1531
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,780
here is that this work should be spun up

1532
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,480
in a new ITF working group for email

1533
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,480
authentication the goals would be to of

1534
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,839
course authenticate email but also

1535
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,000
mitigate this replay

1536
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,140
uh we think that uh this uh you know

1537
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,119
these these authentication methods

1538
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,339
should be able to tolerate uh multi-hop

1539
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:37,079
forwarding because that's what modern

1540
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:40,619
male does these is uh it should also

1541
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:43,099
there should also be a potential

1542
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:45,780
discussion at least of some of the other

1543
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,240
problems that uh forwarding has such as

1544
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,000
mailing list body modifications uh in

1545
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,180
particular the um gondwana draft uh

1546
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,640
proposes some new ideas there and then

1547
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,760
in the appendix of this uh slide deck uh

1548
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,760
there's a number of uh draft Set uh in

1549
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,680
the that have also discussed how to

1550
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,440
solve those types of problems

1551
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,180
um thank you for your time and I look

1552
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,379
forward to your feedback

1553
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,780
and also bronze there on stage that and

1554
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,180
he can also help take some questions

1555
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,900
thank you

1556
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,420
great thank you so please join the queue

1557
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,859
with your comments and questions as a

1558
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,319
question from Murray in this sorry my

1559
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:27,299
client is not allowing me to get in the

1560
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:29,160
queue that's okay I'll I'll one time

1561
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,260
allow it

1562
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,420
yeah okay so um Murray asked the

1563
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,040
question is anyone using any of these

1564
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,900
yet I just the reason I said that is

1565
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,400
because we pointed out on one of the

1566
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,319
slides no one's actually using this yet

1567
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:41,640
and I'm wondering is that true for any

1568
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,480
of them

1569
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,339
uh has anybody tried any of this yet

1570
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:47,040
Yahoo are using their solution which is

1571
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,180
basically to count the number of

1572
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,280
messages that have identical headers

1573
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,740
identical dkim signatures and if they

1574
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,599
get hundreds of thousands of those then

1575
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:56,099
they know that the message is a replay

1576
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:58,619
uh the difficulty is that there is an

1577
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:00,780
edge case where a message has gone to a

1578
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,220
mailing list and has that same header

1579
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,099
going to thousands of users and so it

1580
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:07,319
becomes a heuristic guess it's not a

1581
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:10,079
perfect solution yeah the others not yet

1582
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,880
but there's lots of talk about it and

1583
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,559
the big mail providers are all

1584
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,960
interested in finding the right solution

1585
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,359
okay thank you just with the mic tool um

1586
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:20,099
malfunctioning Barry Leiber let me go

1587
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:20,880
next

1588
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,579
hi thanks Barry Lieber our former D Kim

1589
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:24,900
working group chair

1590
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,380
uh where we discussed this issue a lot

1591
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,559
in the original dkim design decided for

1592
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:34,079
various reasons that we couldn't

1593
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,240
resolve it we now have more information

1594
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,940
we have operational experience that's

1595
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,500
important in this we know what the

1596
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,599
priorities are and we have all the

1597
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:45,780
information to

1598
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:50,460
to debate the pros and cons of uh of

1599
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,260
these different proposals and perhaps

1600
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:53,880
others that come up so I think it's

1601
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,339
important to look at this and I think a

1602
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:58,200
new working group is absolutely the

1603
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,619
right venue to do it thanks Barry

1604
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:03,780
thank you Eric cruscola

1605
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:07,400
first let me say ugh

1606
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:09,780
like I'm just watching this and being

1607
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,400
like Oh god

1608
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,119
um

1609
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:16,559
uh clearly however um with that said uh

1610
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,119
um clearly the working group was the

1611
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:18,960
right place to do this and it sounds

1612
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,700
like there's enough energy and interest

1613
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,980
to do that so I don't think we need a

1614
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,059
Bob I think we could spin up a working

1615
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:26,220
group with a charter like approximated

1616
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,380
this stuff um you know uh pretty much

1617
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,420
now thanks

1618
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,339
okay thank you Jim Fenton

1619
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:37,140
hi Jim Fenton

1620
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:37,920
um

1621
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,700
this was as indicated by the uh by the

1622
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,099
RFC this is definitely something that

1623
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:46,740
was considered in the design of dcam

1624
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,720
um

1625
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,839
one of the uh one of the uh

1626
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:54,480
aspects of of email that I think wasn't

1627
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,160
mentioned in the slides at least it

1628
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,720
might be it might be in the other drafts

1629
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,420
is that the requirement for

1630
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,540
confidentiality of BCC recipients in the

1631
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,280
same domain

1632
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,240
um both

1633
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,660
um both as as bcc's and also on on a

1634
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,760
mailing list you don't uh you don't

1635
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,000
disclose who who all is uh you know when

1636
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,880
you get the recipient of a of a mailing

1637
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,900
list email does not have access to who

1638
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,180
uh else in their domain might have

1639
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,559
gotten that email

1640
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:29,099
so uh I think this is an interesting

1641
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:32,819
problem to solve I have severe questions

1642
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:35,359
about whether this is a solvable problem

1643
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,440
within all of the constraints without

1644
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,240
breaking something that specific

1645
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,920
question is answered in a couple of the

1646
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,559
drafts and the answer is that you split

1647
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,960
it so you send an individual message to

1648
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,940
each person so each basically say

1649
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,500
recipient can only see their own address

1650
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,799
not any other BCC recipient's address

1651
01:02:51,799 --> 01:02:54,780
and that solves it what it does do is it

1652
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,460
explodes the number of copies you need

1653
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:59,099
to send uh 20 years ago that might not

1654
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:01,559
have been as easy to do these days it's

1655
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:03,059
not that big a cost in the same way that

1656
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:06,780
https was originally too expensive to do

1657
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,579
for everything and now we just assume

1658
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:10,740
it's required because computers are now

1659
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:13,140
fast enough it's not a problem okay so

1660
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:16,500
so uh I'm sure Gmail has enough capacity

1661
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,079
to handle the additional incoming mail I

1662
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:21,660
mean this is also a burden on mailing

1663
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,579
lists that are not necessarily the big

1664
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:25,500
providers that need to now split out

1665
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,660
that meal and do a lot of individual

1666
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:28,920
transactions a lot of it's already

1667
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,400
happening

1668
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,079
hey thank you where's hardika next in

1669
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,380
the queue West herricker uscisa I'd like

1670
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,260
to Second ecker's Ugg you know is every

1671
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,700
time we try and bet all these problems

1672
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,880
things get worse and worse and

1673
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,200
um to me I think one of the things

1674
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,420
missing so for me dispatch wise this is

1675
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,220
you know fairly obvious it's a large

1676
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,540
enough problem that it needs a working

1677
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,460
group of its own because it'll consume

1678
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,200
an entire you know two-hour slot every

1679
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,119
meeting for a while

1680
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:58,859
um so that's a no doubt the thing that

1681
01:03:58,859 --> 01:04:01,440
I'm thinking of is more what does this

1682
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,240
look like long term in a lot of other

1683
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,339
places in the ITF we have Ops groups

1684
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:07,140
that last a long time because you need

1685
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,180
to measure and see how well these things

1686
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,760
are doing over time and I think given

1687
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,079
the fact that you know we're coming back

1688
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,359
in to DCM and SPF and stuff over and

1689
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,859
over and over

1690
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:18,540
um and some of these solutions that were

1691
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,980
proposed in particular like some of the

1692
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,480
Accounting Solutions with thresholds and

1693
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,920
stuff really requires continual

1694
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,960
discussion and you know is this working

1695
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,520
or do we need to shift to something new

1696
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,260
and that that seems to me like a longer

1697
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,700
term maintenance working group might be

1698
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,220
needed as well yeah I I agree that it's

1699
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,260
probably time in the next couple of

1700
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,579
years to talk to the area directors

1701
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:37,680
about consolidating the multiple email

1702
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,380
groups into a maintenance group and then

1703
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,000
specific groups that hand their work

1704
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,400
back to that maintenance group over time

1705
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,140
hello area directors do you want to pop

1706
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,280
up and

1707
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,119
comment on that

1708
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,900
yeah

1709
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,599
um we have talked about that uh a

1710
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,700
related concern is that there's a lot of

1711
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,020
these sorts of drafts that are heading

1712
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,520
for the ISE because there's not a

1713
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,559
maintenance working group and the isgu

1714
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:03,299
is a little bit reticent to create well

1715
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,400
we've got some feedback from from some

1716
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,200
very experienced email people that that

1717
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,119
may not be a good idea or it can turn

1718
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,680
into ocean boiling so we need to control

1719
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,599
it appropriately

1720
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:16,920
but the conversation is happening thanks

1721
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,900
okay there's no one else in the queue

1722
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,000
and Murray's had the last word but would

1723
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,339
you like a second last word um so

1724
01:05:23,339 --> 01:05:24,900
Christy you can correct me if I'm wrong

1725
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,579
but it sounds like people are okay with

1726
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:27,960
creating a working group no need for a

1727
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,819
bath okay so if anybody wants to share

1728
01:05:29,819 --> 01:05:31,260
it please let me know and we can start

1729
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,260
working on all that process okay just to

1730
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,940
yeah that is kind of where the dispatch

1731
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,859
outcome is looking like it's heading

1732
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:39,480
I'll just give Cullen enough time to

1733
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,980
join the queue

1734
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:45,059
um uh no I that wasn't actually what I I

1735
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:46,859
heard

1736
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:48,780
um I heard that there's a lot of people

1737
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,099
in the room who don't believe this

1738
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:52,319
problem solvable and that a boss would

1739
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,599
be a great place to see if people think

1740
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:56,760
that there is a workable Solution that's

1741
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,339
that's solvable right so I I'm not I'm

1742
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:00,900
not like saying one way or another but

1743
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,640
I'm saying it wasn't as obvious to me

1744
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,220
that a boss would have the purpose of

1745
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,200
trying to like we've tried to solve this

1746
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,880
problem many times before it's not a new

1747
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,900
problem

1748
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,480
and we failed and has something changed

1749
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,640
fundamentally that people believe that

1750
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,500
that solves it

1751
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,079
okay so I I don't know it's not obvious

1752
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:20,339
to me that we should just go form a

1753
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:21,720
working group without some discussion of

1754
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,920
what that would look like

1755
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,359
okay so

1756
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:25,740
um just before Barry joins I don't think

1757
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,599
anyone's mentioned a buff but that

1758
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:28,920
doesn't mean that that's not the

1759
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,960
sentiment of the room so just Barry over

1760
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,099
to you

1761
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:34,440
oh this is Barry Lebo the to just to

1762
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,900
answer Colin what what's changed is that

1763
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,319
we have more experience with using dkm

1764
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,900
and SPF and dmarc which wraps the two of

1765
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:46,319
them together and we know what use cases

1766
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,119
we have a better sense of what use cases

1767
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:50,180
are important and which ones we can

1768
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,140
compromise on

1769
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,480
so some of the reasons that we didn't

1770
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,160
want to do this kind of solution before

1771
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,440
we we can reevaluate them and decide

1772
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,720
whether it's okay now to say that use

1773
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,280
case is less important than we thought

1774
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,500
it was and that sort of thing right so

1775
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,059
that makes sense exactly what you said

1776
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:10,559
but I didn't hear a single discussion

1777
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,180
today of the use cases people are

1778
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,680
willing to compromise on that they

1779
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,119
weren't willing to compromise on before

1780
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,920
and that is going to be the messy part

1781
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,539
in this stuff right it will be and

1782
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:20,039
that's what the working group will have

1783
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:21,180
to decide

1784
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:24,299
so okay so apart from Colin I haven't

1785
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:26,280
heard anyone raise the need for a bath

1786
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,680
if you believe that a buff is needed

1787
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,960
please hurry yourself to the queue or

1788
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,819
else I'm going to say that the majority

1789
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:34,619
of us think just a working group on its

1790
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:36,780
own is is fine and that those problems

1791
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,160
will be sorted out in the working group

1792
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,599
itself

1793
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,760
so I'll do a slow countdown sort of like

1794
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,319
an auction going going gone

1795
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:48,660
okay then a dispatch outcome here is to

1796
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,700
form a new working group without a buff

1797
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,740
thanks go see okay thank you very much

1798
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,420
for presenting both of you

1799
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,480
and uh we like to welcome up our final

1800
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,359
dispatch draft for today

1801
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:03,539
um on web Sergio

1802
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:06,359
right take it away

1803
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:10,160
yep then this is ladies

1804
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,240
yes so if I presented we pay I said

1805
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,520
another couple of years ago so

1806
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,420
a web is really similar to whip but then

1807
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:24,179
take you into account the egress part so

1808
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:27,479
I review reviews some of the slides that

1809
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:30,779
I presented that I did when presented

1810
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:34,738
with to this part so a webrtc still the

1811
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:36,060
best media transform protocol for

1812
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:38,339
real-time streaming it is even if there

1813
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:41,179
are other protocols that are being

1814
01:08:41,179 --> 01:08:44,880
discussed right now for example but I

1815
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,859
mean whether this is irrelevant in this

1816
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:49,698
space however we don't have any

1817
01:08:49,698 --> 01:08:52,399
standard protocol that we can use

1818
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,339
alongside with it I mean see if an NPP

1819
01:08:56,339 --> 01:08:59,759
are mainly focused on conferencing and a

1820
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,698
rtsp is not very well suited for using

1821
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:04,799
with a webrtc

1822
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:08,399
so as a consequence all the webrtc

1823
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:11,219
streaming services are doing their own

1824
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:13,319
custom implementation of the signaling

1825
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:14,339
protocol

1826
01:09:14,339 --> 01:09:16,380
and as a consequence there is no

1827
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,219
interoperative between either the

1828
01:09:19,219 --> 01:09:23,100
service install fund players and even in

1829
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,020
between different services

1830
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:29,698
so why is web needed I mean it is a

1831
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:32,399
the the main driven for web probably is

1832
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,500
the interior interoperability between

1833
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:38,279
webrtc services and product and it's

1834
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:41,160
like and lately we have been seeing a

1835
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,640
trend about being able to have like a

1836
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,219
avoiding vendor lock-in but being able

1837
01:09:47,219 --> 01:09:50,819
to have like a backup solutions for

1838
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:54,480
webrtc streaming so you can uh you don't

1839
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,580
when you are building your services you

1840
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:59,400
are not looking to the the webrtc

1841
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,280
provider that you choose but you can

1842
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,020
decide to move all later on without

1843
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:07,140
there being lock into a specific a

1844
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,480
vendor or even if you for example there

1845
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,840
is a a notice in a service you can move

1846
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,400
to a different service provider without

1847
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,060
being impacted in in your in your

1848
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,300
customers or even you can have multiple

1849
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,040
webrtc providers to be able to load

1850
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,460
balance or decide because someone works

1851
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:29,400
better in a region than others so and

1852
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,140
this is becoming very important in

1853
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,219
webrtc

1854
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:35,940
also a probably in um a bit lower

1855
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,159
priority than that the first one is that

1856
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,920
we could start by using a player server

1857
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,860
that is can you can easily be integrated

1858
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:44,880
in

1859
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,620
in in your service I mean this is has

1860
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:53,060
not been a a real algorithm for webrtc

1861
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,380
services so far because you typically

1862
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,520
just Implement your

1863
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:04,260
ux based on with a HTML JavaScript so

1864
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,600
there is not much problem with just

1865
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,060
implemented your the custom just with to

1866
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,340
handle them the playback of the of the

1867
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:14,239
webrtc streams but

1868
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:17,880
this is something that it is a good

1869
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,580
health and that you know webrtc and some

1870
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,320
survey on some devices that don't

1871
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,360
support him the web artist is stuck in

1872
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,960
JavaScript for example division or iot

1873
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,840
when having a been able to just provide

1874
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:35,120
a simple interface for playing web

1875
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,800
stream is much easier that just provided

1876
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,400
the full JavaScript and customizable API

1877
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,780
and

1878
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:45,900
on them and the last scene is the

1879
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,239
integration that it would be we have

1880
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,880
been discussing with the impact does the

1881
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,900
passive group about integrating stdp

1882
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,320
does playback with with webrtc so you

1883
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,420
could have like a

1884
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,140
um an integrated player where you can be

1885
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,600
both having a live stream coming through

1886
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,340
webrtc but you could also be using a hdb

1887
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,460
dashboard going backward in times and

1888
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,380
start watching one even for example for

1889
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:20,060
for the beginning of the of the of of of

1890
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:23,340
the of the event instead of having just

1891
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,739
the the live feed

1892
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:28,860
so uh that's a lie thank you so as I

1893
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,900
said before we bang web are very similar

1894
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,880
in the scope and Technical solution

1895
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,640
but the egress part of the of the of the

1896
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:42,060
of this protocol is a explicitly out of

1897
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:45,000
a scoreboard with a working group

1898
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,840
but also a web at least the drops I have

1899
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,060
I have created reduce almost all the

1900
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,620
mechanics that I we have put in place

1901
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:54,600
for Whip and the draft is basically just

1902
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,300
a replacement of for whip to whip and

1903
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,840
Ingress for regress and so they are

1904
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,020
really really similar so

1905
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:07,980
and also a week and web both protocols

1906
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,440
can be used together to provide service

1907
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,540
center with their availability

1908
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:15,060
so I think that it should make sense to

1909
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,159
register the they will say working group

1910
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:20,820
to include also a great signal and not

1911
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,520
also and not only English

1912
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,380
so necess like this so just a very quick

1913
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:31,260
um look up of how the the web protocol

1914
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:35,280
works it is essentially the same as as

1915
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,860
what a whip does is just say the web

1916
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:42,060
player we will create a make an HTTP

1917
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,760
boss request with the sap offer there to

1918
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,860
the end to the weapon point then the the

1919
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:49,500
weapon will return an sdp answer in the

1920
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:53,159
in the response the I say nandi and dtls

1921
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:55,739
will be set up and then we will have an

1922
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:58,800
HTTP API to provide

1923
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,480
um other functionalities like for

1924
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,280
example the teardown of the session or

1925
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:05,580
the IC restart and and check the lights

1926
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:08,640
that it is also shared with sweep so

1927
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,980
necess slide

1928
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,140
so really quick this is just to show

1929
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:18,840
that uh we could just use a

1930
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,719
a weapon web to be able to interpret

1931
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:23,580
into to create interiority between

1932
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,159
different Services because as they just

1933
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:29,880
share the the an HTTP base with

1934
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,800
mechanism with sdp or financial exchange

1935
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,480
it will be really easy to just create

1936
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,000
gateways that could allow us to to

1937
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,540
interoperate different and whip

1938
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:43,080
endpoints and weak with clients with web

1939
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,100
employees and web clients

1940
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:49,380
so this is late yep

1941
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,960
so the what's missing in the in the

1942
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,320
draft well the whip is say already or is

1943
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,260
going to be in working group last call

1944
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:02,580
and during this week so the the protocol

1945
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:07,260
is quite mature and web has same reduce

1946
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,060
most of it so

1947
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,000
it should be quite close to to have

1948
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,760
something that it is doable but web has

1949
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,040
a bit more requestment that the in terms

1950
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,679
of functionality didn't whip for example

1951
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:22,100
we will have to work on on

1952
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,699
on on essential super multi-language or

1953
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:29,280
a more controls on the playback side for

1954
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,460
example pause or mute

1955
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,679
subtitles metadata or cleanser

1956
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:37,500
resolution when you are using a multi

1957
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,640
build rate

1958
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,620
adaptation so

1959
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,260
there is still some somewhere to do

1960
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:46,140
so message like this

1961
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:49,739
so the main question is say where are we

1962
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:51,659
going to first Define the protocol and

1963
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:55,020
extension if it is a just a matter of

1964
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,360
Richard in the with working group also

1965
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,580
we create a new working group for a

1966
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:03,920
handle and then the web specification

1967
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,440
okay thank you very much for presenting

1968
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,080
Sergio so open up the queue if there are

1969
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,420
questions comments or thoughts on where

1970
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:15,659
this should go if anywhere on this work

1971
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:17,940
then please add yourself to the queue

1972
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,960
get up in the room

1973
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:27,179
okay

1974
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:28,679
um someone said they can't work out

1975
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:30,120
Colin Jennings I can't think I had to

1976
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,560
get on the Queue anymore but plus one to

1977
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,020
reach out to the wish working group to

1978
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,880
do this

1979
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,659
um okay Murray you've joined the queue

1980
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:43,159
has this been discussed in wish at all

1981
01:16:43,159 --> 01:16:46,800
uh we are it is in the agenda for the

1982
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,520
for this uh for this Thursday I think we

1983
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,460
try to present it in a in the in the

1984
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:55,500
last meeting in the last ITF meeting but

1985
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,739
as it was in not in the scope of the of

1986
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,480
the working group we only have like five

1987
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,580
minutes and we couldn't present it very

1988
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:06,719
very very well so it is easier I mean

1989
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,640
discussing something that it is not in

1990
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,500
the in the scope of the chart itself is

1991
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,480
difficult to do it in the world in the

1992
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,920
working group but we are going to try to

1993
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,739
present it and hopefully we have a a

1994
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:19,199
resolution of if we are going to be able

1995
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,360
to reach out the the working group it

1996
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,060
will be easier to get it in the arena so

1997
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,860
for Christy I wonder if we should wait

1998
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:27,840
until for the outcome of that before we

1999
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,000
decide what we're going to do with it

2000
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,520
thank you yeah Sean Turner you're next

2001
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,000
yeah hi um Sean Turner um Sarah Whip or

2002
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,920
wish

2003
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,620
all confused um in any in any event um

2004
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,000
yeah so last time we had about five

2005
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,080
minutes to talk about it this time we're

2006
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,640
gonna have about 30. this is kind of

2007
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,500
just jumping the gun right so at the end

2008
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,900
of the day we know it's not in Charter

2009
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,219
so if we're going to do it we're either

2010
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:51,360
going to reach out or you're going to do

2011
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,219
working group there's no objection at

2012
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:55,739
this point to re-chartering so just kind

2013
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:58,080
of like basically priming the gun here

2014
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,340
so

2015
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,040
okay thank you both so it sounds like

2016
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,900
the result is what's already happening

2017
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,060
to have the session and wish about this

2018
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:09,420
and see if the retarding is in scope

2019
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:12,480
okay so that brings us to the end of the

2020
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,699
ditch Dispatch session

2021
01:18:14,699 --> 01:18:16,620
um part of this meeting so as you know

2022
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,360
we combine this meeting with the art

2023
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,659
area uh meeting as well so just to recap

2024
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:23,580
our dispatch outcomes before we move

2025
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:26,400
into the art portion of the meeting we

2026
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,640
heard um on the topic vcon so the

2027
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,380
dispatch result was to create a draft of

2028
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,000
the use case a problem statement to

2029
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,920
clarify the scope and take it to a buff

2030
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,620
I've been asked to mention that the

2031
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:40,020

with this work in its current form

2036
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:51,300
for dkim replay we are forming a new

2037
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,420
working group without a buff and for web

2038
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:56,520
um we are holding and letting the

2039
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,860
session in wish progress to see if a

2040
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,739
re-charter is appropriate

2041
01:19:01,739 --> 01:19:04,020
okay so over to the art section of the

2042
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:07,199
meeting Murray do you want to come up

2043
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:08,820

2044
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:12,380
claim your your spot

2045
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:16,879
foreign

2046
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:20,400
from this time from this microphone

2047
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,140
um one just one quick announcement

2048
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:23,820
Francesca you've probably seen

2049
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,940
announcement is returning to her duties

2050
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,560
um so she will be taking back over

2051
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,360
supervision of the working groups that

2052
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,400
she normally looks after this is our

2053
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,860
third area director by the way

2054
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:37,759
um if

2055
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,340
I think she can hear us all

2056
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:41,940
right

2057
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,980
um if I've been looking after stuff

2058
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,659
while she was on maternity leave if

2059
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:46,980
there's anything that's supposed to be

2060
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,420
in my queue that I haven't acknowledged

2061
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,880
please message me I'll still take care

2062
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,440
of things while she's coming ramping

2063
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,060
back up otherwise I'm things are going

2064
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:56,699
to be drifting back to her control I

2065
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:59,040
think my cue is empty except for one

2066
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,120
document from one of my own working

2067
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,380
groups but if I've missed something

2068
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,699
please let me know

2069
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:04,199
and I think that's all I wanted to say

2070
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,780
today unless there are

2071
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,400
I don't need to go through all that okay

2072
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,659
thank

2073
01:20:09,659 --> 01:20:12,980
you um so yeah we always put this up

2074
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,199
to highlight some Buffs and side

2075
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:18,540
meetings coming up and other interesting

2076
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,400
meetings the dispatch meetings as I'm

2077
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,780
sure you find are very interesting

2078
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,580
because you get the first look at a lot

2079
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,800
of work coming into the ietf so it's a

2080
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,739
good place to be the IAB open meetings

2081
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:31,260
always interesting and the RFC editor

2082
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,960
future development program always draws

2083
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,900
a crowd a couple of side meetings vcom

2084
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,460
we've mentioned an ebpf which we're

2085
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,380
going to hear about in a moment

2086
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,360
um and then the boss as listed at the

2087
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,460
top there as well

2088
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,620
okay but without further Ado let's get

2089
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:49,739
into the art portion of the agenda so up

2090
01:20:49,739 --> 01:20:52,260
first we have Stephen Farrell presenting

2091
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,340
on ngi funding

2092
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:05,580
hey good morning so I think that's why

2093
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,080
it kind of says it already

2094
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,580
um there's a it's a funding scheme for

2095
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,020
people who want to do open source work

2096
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:12,420
for you know in small chunks of money so

2097
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:15,080
next slide

2098
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:19,020
uh so if you're you know if this is

2099
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,820
turns out relevant you can talk to me

2100
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:22,980
you can talk to my colleague Kerry we're

2101
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,179
going to hang around in one of the side

2102
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:25,560
meeting rooms to say this evening in

2103
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,120
case people want to talk about it or

2104
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,679
there's links there for applying for the

2105
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:31,640
money next slide

2106
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:34,159
foreign

2107
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,159
things anyone can apply so you don't

2108
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,420
have to be a company

2109
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:41,520
an individual can do it or a group of

2110
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,840
people together or some open source

2111
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,940
projects can do this

2112
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,860
um you don't have to be academic you

2113
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,060
don't have to be based in the EU

2114
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,159
although there you do have to have a

2115
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:52,860
story about the EU somehow so I think

2116
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,120
typically what's happened that this has

2117
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,739
been running for a few years already

2118
01:21:55,739 --> 01:21:57,840
I think most non-eu people tend to try

2119
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,400
and partner up with somebody in the EU

2120
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,679
to apply for the funding and that seems

2121
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:05,060
to work so next slide

2122
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,260
um this is kind of a bunch of weird

2123
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,179
terminology here so ngi sounds like this

2124
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:11,219
kind of grand you know next Generation

2125
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:12,600
internet thing but actually it's it's a

2126
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,159
funding mechanism

2127
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:17,880
um and ngi zero is a subset of that and

2128
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,080
we're involved with kind of helping out

2129
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,060
that most of this the ngi zero Things

2130
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:21,840
Are

2131
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,199
driven by nlnet Foundation Michael

2132
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,239
leaner is there and they have about 9.6

2133
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:28,620
million to give out over the next few

2134
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:31,040
years in these kind of smallish chunks

2135
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,840
uh so we're helping with that we're not

2136
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,940
part of selecting who gets funded so we

2137
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,020
can kind of talk to people about

2138
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:39,780
whatever they want to talk about

2139
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:42,060
um and part of our you know part of what

2140
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,380
we're doing there is to try and help

2141
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:45,120
some of those projects want to bring

2142
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,520
things to the ITF and so we're there to

2143
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,780
try and help them do that or try and

2144
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:50,400
convince them not to try and not to even

2145
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,860
bother uh if that's the right answer

2146
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:54,179
and I think that might be the last slide

2147
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:56,280
it was the next one

2148
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,960
oh yeah so there's a there's there's

2149
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,820
basically current funding schemes

2150
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,140
there's a guide for applicants there for

2151
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,239
the main one and for those people who

2152
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:05,219
are funded there's a review thing which

2153
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:07,320
allows them to ask for support if they

2154
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:10,320
want to get like Security review or a

2155
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,300
review about how accessible their their

2156
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,520
technology is uh for people with

2157
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,760
disabilities or vision problems whatever

2158
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,620
um so it seems like a reasonable scheme

2159
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,239
and I think that is the last slide is it

2160
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:22,580
next one

2161
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,800
yeah so any questions this is basically

2162
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,420
just an announcement that I think what's

2163
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,679
different about this game is that

2164
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:31,380
typical EU funding it takes like a year

2165
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,360
to get the money and you have to get a

2166
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,280
whole Consortium together to get the

2167
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,580
money whereas this is yeah calls every

2168
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,340
two months for small amounts of money

2169
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,780
suitable for people working on open

2170
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:44,940
source projects

2171
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,980
um so yeah if you're interested you can

2172
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,900
come on there or if you've got a

2173
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,719
question at the mic now that's fine too

2174
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:53,520
great thank you if anyone has any

2175
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,620
questions about the topic please do join

2176
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,820
the queue

2177
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:59,640
but seeing no one so far just say thank

2178
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:02,280
you very much awareness

2179
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,980
okay we continue down our art area

2180
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:08,699
meeting agenda up next ebpf

2181
01:24:08,699 --> 01:24:11,040
Dave all right next slide meeting

2182
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,320
announcement uh so it was actually

2183
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,080
interesting at the uh hackathon ebpf

2184
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,400
showed up on a bunch of slides which

2185
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,960
kind of you know surprised me in a good

2186
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:19,860
way

2187
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:22,080
um so recently an ebtf Foundation was

2188
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,760
formed underneath the Linux Foundation

2189
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,179
as a sort as a home for open source and

2190
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:29,520
I'm in the leadership of both ebpf

2191
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,679
foundation and of course ietf and so I

2192
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,199
get to do the rage between the two So

2193
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:36,719
for anybody that doesn't know evvf and

2194
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:38,159
I'm giving the same presentation by the

2195
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,600
way an INT area which hopefully will

2196
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,800
cover most of the relevant people

2197
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,440
between the two areas

2198
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,659
um the best way to summarize ebpf in

2199
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:46,860
case you're new to it is it's a

2200
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,540
cross-platform technology it actually

2201
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,280
came from originally the Linux kernel

2202
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,980
and is was derived from BPF which came

2203
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,260
from the BSD kernel before that

2204
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,040
cross-platform technology the current

2205
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,380
sandbox programs to extend a privilege

2206
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,120
system component and if you ask what it

2207
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,560
stands for the answer is it no longer

2208
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,719
stands for anything

2209
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:05,400
next slide

2210
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,260
so rough analogy and I'm going to

2211
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,219
stretch things a little bit here

2212
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:10,560
JavaScript is to the browser what ebpf

2213
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,020
is to an OS kernel okay now of course

2214
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,520
the analogy is correct that JavaScript

2215
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,500
isn't just for browsers ebpf is not just

2216
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,659
for an OS kernel but what it did is it

2217
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:20,280
made JavaScript made a browser be

2218
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,320
programmable right so you're not limited

2219
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,460
to the functionality that ships in the

2220
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,860
browser similarly ebpf makes the OS

2221
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,239
kernel be programmable so you're not

2222
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:28,860
limited to what ships in the OS kernel

2223
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,179
and some people use it to extend say

2224
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:32,400
your TCP stack or some other privileged

2225
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,600
system component

2226
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,360
next slide

2227
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,400
this is an example of how it's organized

2228
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,960
in the Linux kernel which is the most

2229
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,860
dominant use of evpf other uses would be

2230
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:46,380
we're making it work on Windows uh

2231
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:48,480
there's various uh Nik Hardware cards

2232
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,620
that actually support it so you can

2233
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:51,120
offload stuff into your neck and so on

2234
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,040
this is the Linux kernel example so you

2235
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,900
have ebtf program that's written in some

2236
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,699
particular language of your choice C

2237
01:25:56,699 --> 01:26:00,780
rust go whatever it gets compiled into a

2238
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,820
particular byte code format

2239
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:05,400
and then an application can then load

2240
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,960
that into the kernel and so it's red

2241
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,520
there because it's considered untrusted

2242
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,320
until it hits the box that's labeled

2243
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,420
verifier that does a formal proof

2244
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:14,100
basically it's a static analysis

2245
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:16,320
verifier that if it can prove that it's

2246
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,840
safe in terms of executing within a

2247
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,480
conceptual sandbox then it can be jit

2248
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,820
compiled into native code and run and

2249
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,920
interact and extend in this example in

2250
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,659
OS kernel right and then it can

2251
01:26:27,659 --> 01:26:29,520
communicate back with user mode things

2252
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,139
through shared memory that's called Maps

2253
01:26:31,139 --> 01:26:32,580
okay just so you understand some

2254
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,500
terminology so this is what ebpf is

2255
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,480
using the Linux kernel example so

2256
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,920
there's a bunch of yeah next slide

2257
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,659
please there's a bunch of different

2258
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:42,540
categories of things that um people

2259
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,699
would like to see standardized in some

2260
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:47,639
place okay so there's a list of things

2261
01:26:47,639 --> 01:26:49,440
that are up there

2262
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,400
um you can see there's a bunch of

2263
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,139
different categories so next I'm not

2264
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:53,340
going to walk through those right you

2265
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:54,420
can see the list if you're familiar with

2266
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,880
BTS with uh BPF then

2267
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,199
um you'll recognize some of the terms

2268
01:26:58,199 --> 01:26:59,400
and stuff there but hopefully you can

2269
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,380
figure them out from the previous slide

2270
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:02,699
next slide

2271
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:04,500
so the purpose of the side meeting is to

2272
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:05,820
figure out whether it makes sense to

2273
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,679
actually have a buff is ietf actually

2274
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,900
the right place for it or not right okay

2275
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,179
because it can be argued both ways right

2276
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:14,580
my initial impression was no ietf is not

2277
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:15,960
the right place but there's enough using

2278
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,000
the ietf that maybe something might be

2279
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,139
and so that's why we're going to have a

2280
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:21,420
side meeting there's a bunch of ebfpf

2281
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:23,820
users that are here at ietf so let's get

2282
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:25,260
them in a side beating and decide where

2283
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:27,300
we want to take stuff and the evpf

2284
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,800
foundation here's the four possibilities

2285
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,300
that we've discussed the bottom one is

2286
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:32,820
the scope of the side meeting okay the

2287
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,620
evpf foundation could just say as an

2288
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:35,880
open source organization we're going to

2289
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,159
publish you know Standard specs even

2290
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,360
though we're an open source organization

2291
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,100
we could do that we could take that and

2292
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,420
then take it and get an ISO number

2293
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,460
afterwards like some other small seos do

2294
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:45,960
we could publish as an independent

2295
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,719
stream RFC or an IIT frfc okay so the

2296
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:49,800
purpose of side meeting is not the

2297
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,260
technical discussion it's the which SEO

2298
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,880
was the right place to to actually put

2299
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,080
the documents that's the purpose the

2300
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,460
side meeting if you have views on that

2301
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:58,560
come to the side meeting Thursday 6 p.m

2302
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,679
right after the last Thursday session

2303
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,659
um thanks thank you actually if you have

2304
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:05,940
views on it you we have time if you want

2305
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,280
to express that view now based on the

2306
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,659
presentation we've just seen But thank

2307
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,639
you Dave for sharing it with us I'll

2308
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:13,679
just pause in case anyone does want to

2309
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,040
join the queue I will mention that um

2310
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:20,100
evpf is often used to extend networking

2311
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,239
functionality but it's not just for

2312
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:22,620
networking people use it to extend

2313
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:26,340
security observability and so on the uh

2314
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:28,139
on the bottom bullets of the seven

2315
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:30,420
possible uh standard stuff some of those

2316
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:31,860
were networking specific when it says

2317
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:33,360
cross-platform program types and

2318
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,460
cross-platform map types that's really

2319
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:36,600
the only thing that you could say is

2320
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,400
specifically about networking is those

2321
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,080
bottom two bullets there's some subsets

2322
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,900
of that is okay I see comments yeah

2323
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,420
David can I see you first hi David

2324
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:49,260
skanazi Google I closer oh yes sorry

2325
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:52,139
I'll eat the mic with the mask

2326
01:28:52,139 --> 01:28:52,980
um

2327
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:55,620
I at first I I generally was of the

2328
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:58,440
opinion that like ITF shouldn't

2329
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,420
standardize apis

2330
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:02,699
but then we kind of gave up on

2331
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:06,540
standardizing apis and then apis haven't

2332
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:10,920
changed in decades and you know for a

2333
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,600
lot of things like look at sockets like

2334
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,280
hello does anyone have a pulse can we

2335
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,739
make this thing better uh anyway all

2336
01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:19,440
that to say I really think this is

2337
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,500
important this is useful having it

2338
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,659
standardized is really great if we you

2339
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,639
know if you manage to make your analogy

2340
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,260
with JavaScript work that would be

2341
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:31,620
amazing uh so I think the ITF would be a

2342
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:33,239
good place because

2343
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:35,159
um I know that we have a pulse and we'll

2344
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:36,719
get stuff done

2345
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:37,980
um I don't know the other organization

2346
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,480
they could be good too but I think this

2347
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,340
would be a good place so I'd I'd be very

2348
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:42,780
supportive of seeing this work here okay

2349
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:43,980
I'd encourage you to come to the side

2350
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,300
meeting

2351
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:48,000
um and uh between those seven bullets

2352
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,380
that were back there it's arguable

2353
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,780
whether any of them are actually apis uh

2354
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:53,159
the bottom two you could argue might be

2355
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:56,780
abstract apis in the same census like um

2356
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:59,520
uh some other working groups do abstract

2357
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,800
apis I guess you know maybe taps or

2358
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,739
before that the um the security one

2359
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:06,600
um the acronym escapes me right now I'm

2360
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,179
sure Echo remember all right next

2361
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:12,960
uh can you go back to actually more list

2362
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,120
oh sorry just yeah go back to which one

2363
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,620
is the seven bullet list the seven

2364
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,360
bullet list yeah

2365
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,500
so we're not allowed to say birthday

2366
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,320
packet filter anymore

2367
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,120
uh it no longer stands for that because

2368
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,219
it's not limited to networking and so

2369
01:30:26,219 --> 01:30:28,320
the P implies packet yeah of course and

2370
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,900
so uh the ebpf foundation even before

2371
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,460
that right it said no longer stands for

2372
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,719
things because they don't want people to

2373
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,340
limit their view to say this is just for

2374
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:36,600
networking it's not applicable to me

2375
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,659
right so it's like KFC

2376
01:30:39,659 --> 01:30:41,940
so

2377
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:43,080
um

2378
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,460
um yeah

2379
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:47,280
um yeah so um

2380
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,100
so I mean this is good stuff

2381
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:52,080
um I I think the analogy actually draws

2382
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,300
to wasm more than to JavaScript but um

2383
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,340
uh uh whatever

2384
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:57,000
um

2385
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,880
I I guess I am um I would like to see it

2386
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:00,900
on somewhere

2387
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,179
um uh I'm like less I think excited

2388
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:04,620
about having an ITF

2389
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:06,900
um merely for um for probably cultural

2390
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,820
and Technical reasons which is that

2391
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,139
designing

2392
01:31:10,139 --> 01:31:11,760
um the isas for this kind of thing

2393
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,020
especially

2394
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:14,219
um requires really understanding how

2395
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,600
jets work

2396
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,100
um it requires a feminine understanding

2397
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,840
about Dynamic languages and what only

2398
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,159
mechanical language fast don't make

2399
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:21,480
verification work none of which is

2400
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,219
expertise which is really found in this

2401
01:31:23,219 --> 01:31:25,380
Arena and so if you look at what wasm

2402
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:27,420
did they formed a Wes so JavaScript of

2403
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:31,560
course is done in tc39 and um uh um and

2404
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:35,460
uh um plasm is done um in the w3c uh

2405
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:37,139
wising community group followed by w3c

2406
01:31:37,139 --> 01:31:39,060
was a working group

2407
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,639
um now I will say that that at least in

2408
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:43,860
um in my senses in both those areas they

2409
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:45,420
just sucked in a bunch of compiler like

2410
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,800
people and like which people did that

2411
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:47,880
work

2412
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:48,960
um but

2413
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,120
um my sense is that that might not work

2414
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:51,840
here

2415
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,580
um and in particular the working mode

2416
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,679
that those screws tend to have is very

2417
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,780
intense and very like um and answer

2418
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:58,800
culturally very different from the

2419
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,659
working mode we have and so well I think

2420
01:32:00,659 --> 01:32:02,100
there's a I do want to emphasize I think

2421
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,239
this is exciting work and I'm glad it's

2422
01:32:03,239 --> 01:32:05,100
happening I'm less excited about having

2423
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:06,540
it here I think that people would find

2424
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:08,040
it frustrating to be here and work with

2425
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,040
us and have uh frankly um

2426
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,500
um um and in particular I think they

2427
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,360
would find you know

2428
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,980
um how should I phrase this to sort of

2429
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:19,380
drop in tourism that we often get

2430
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:21,060
um very very irritating

2431
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,040
um in in design of these I say very very

2432
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,659
technical features which as I say really

2433
01:32:24,659 --> 01:32:26,580
requires anyhow have just work and how

2434
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:27,900
processors work

2435
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:31,460
yep um by commenters that um this is

2436
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:34,260
widely deployed

2437
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:37,560
um and not standardized and so there's a

2438
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,760
bunch of people already out there in the

2439
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,780
community that do those things but

2440
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,280
they're not necessarily iatf people to

2441
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,440
ecker's point uh yeah a number of them

2442
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,120
will be on the side meeting because the

2443
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,800
side meeting is a hybrid meeting and the

2444
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,000
zoom meeting and a bunch of them will be

2445
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,580
remote and I would like to encourage

2446
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:51,780
more interaction between the two

2447
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:53,159
communities regardless of which one of

2448
01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:55,080
the which one of the standardization

2449
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,300
places it goes so I guess oh yes the

2450
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,040
other thing I would say is um the fact

2451
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,139
that it is so widely deployed I think

2452
01:33:01,139 --> 01:33:02,760
um requires a certain amount of care in

2453
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,860
terms of care and feeding and

2454
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:06,000
um you know having been through this

2455
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,580
process multiple times and um uh you

2456
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,360
know

2457
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,340
um the itf's um attitude about like well

2458
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:12,540
it's just like make everything a little

2459
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,860
Indian if it's a big Indian or vice

2460
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,900
versa um and all that and I wish like

2461
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,940
renumber all the instructions in the VM

2462
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:18,840
um just because we don't like the way

2463
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,580
the way they're spelled like that seems

2464
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:21,840
like kind of like disruption the idea

2465
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,159
often like brings the party that like

2466
01:33:23,159 --> 01:33:24,120
you would not want to bring to the party

2467
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:26,460
in this case yeah

2468
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:28,080
not only is it mature it is actually

2469
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,699
still evolving right and so there's

2470
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:31,380
obviously some concern about how fast

2471
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,480
can the ietf keep up with things and

2472
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,280
what's the right documentation process

2473
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,620
as you do extensions and so that's from

2474
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,600
the ebpf community that's classically

2475
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,100
not evpf that some of their questions

2476
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,719
and so getting everybody in the same

2477
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,340
room to be able to discuss those sorts

2478
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:45,900
of things to will actually help inform

2479
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:49,219
where's the best place to do it okay

2480
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:54,420
and listening to the presentation if I

2481
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:57,719
had substituted wasn't for epbf it would

2482
01:33:57,719 --> 01:33:59,460
have been almost identical

2483
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:02,699
have uh what's the what's your

2484
01:34:02,699 --> 01:34:05,940
perception of the relationship between

2485
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:11,820
uh this and wasn't and this developer

2486
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,320
community and there wasn't there there

2487
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,760
were Pokemon

2488
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,159
uh it's a good question I do not know

2489
01:34:17,159 --> 01:34:19,199
wasn't enough to give you a definitive

2490
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:21,540
answer myself uh so there's probably

2491
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:22,679
other people who might have to compare

2492
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:24,000
notes with to give you something I don't

2493
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,860
know if wasm is typically used in kernel

2494
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,020
space

2495
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:30,300
um whereas evpf is widely used in kernel

2496
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,480
space

2497
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:35,280
and so if so I've only heard of it being

2498
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,600
used in user space I don't know if

2499
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,679
there's kernel space you just have to

2500
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,239
ask somebody here so

2501
01:34:39,239 --> 01:34:41,699
my sense is that um you know both these

2502
01:34:41,699 --> 01:34:44,400
are um growing metastasizing whichever

2503
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,320
one you never would you want to choose

2504
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,699
um and that was in this is going

2505
01:34:47,699 --> 01:34:49,980
downwards and this is growing upwards um

2506
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:51,300
I'm surprising of course started in

2507
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:52,920
browsers and is now moving towards you

2508
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,020
know depending Cloud infrastructure

2509
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,100
um you know

2510
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,900
because I don't I mean I think at some

2511
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:58,980
level of course these are competitors

2512
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:00,480
analogies in the same way like the Java

2513
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,920
VM is a computer technology

2514
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,239
um but I think you know there's like

2515
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:05,400
room for more than one V one jitted VM

2516
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,239
thing

2517
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:07,739
um one thing I will say is that um

2518
01:35:07,739 --> 01:35:09,480
eliasm does not appear to have the proof

2519
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,699
stage that this has Verizon is um is

2520
01:35:11,699 --> 01:35:13,080
correct by construction rather than

2521
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,960
being um uh um you know rather than

2522
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,940
being proved the way this is I mean a

2523
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:19,020
particular

2524
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:21,719
um uh I don't know EPF well but the um

2525
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:23,940
uh I assume part of the proof is about

2526
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,199
verifying that you can't like reference

2527
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:26,219
outside your own outside of the map

2528
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:28,020
sandbox among other things the same way

2529
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:29,699
that knackle proof of termination within

2530
01:35:29,699 --> 01:35:31,199
a fixed number of instructions that have

2531
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:32,880
the same with a knackle for instance was

2532
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,360
yeah um and so like I say why ISM does

2533
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,400
this is um last name is like pure

2534
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,139
compute and then you have to provide

2535
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:41,520
affordances to do anything outside of

2536
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,060
wasm so I think like um you know I think

2537
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:46,739
it might I mean it might be worth trying

2538
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:47,699
to see if there's Quest pollination

2539
01:35:47,699 --> 01:35:48,719
between the community to see like

2540
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:50,460
they're cool things to be stolen

2541
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:51,600
um but

2542
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,199
um but my sense is that that the uh

2543
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,000
um the aspirations are different enough

2544
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,199
um you know Wiseman is really for like a

2545
01:35:58,199 --> 01:35:59,520
long running process like for very like

2546
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,600
a long running process very long

2547
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,920
execution processes because otherwise

2548
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,420
you just kind of run JavaScript

2549
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:05,699
um and um and high compute where it

2550
01:36:05,699 --> 01:36:06,719
sounds like it's low compute and

2551
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,060
lightweight so that's my sense yep thank

2552
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,639
you that uh that that all makes sense um

2553
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:13,860
I have a vague recollection that there

2554
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:15,540
was a presentation somewhere recently

2555
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:17,639
maybe at Linux plumbers or open source

2556
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:19,020
Summit that actually did have both of

2557
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,280
them the same presentation made that

2558
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,380
same analogy that wasm is kind of at the

2559
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:24,120
top working its way downwards and ebpf

2560
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,380
is the bottom working its way upwards

2561
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,580
and there's kind of this fuzzy area in

2562
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:28,380
between I thinking it was awesome that

2563
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:29,580
was about that I can look it up and if I

2564
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:31,260
can find it I'll post it to the to the

2565
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,760
list

2566
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,860
um so all right thank you very much Dave

2567
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:36,480
and thanks everyone for your input just

2568
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,980
a reminder that side meeting is on

2569
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:40,679
Thursday at 6 00 PM so further views

2570
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:43,260
please add them there okay it's our last

2571
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,120
um item on the agenda today this is in

2572
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,219
the art area part of the meeting still

2573
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:50,780
uh we're looking at a testable HTTP so

2574
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:53,040
over to

2575
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,239
um hey

2576
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:56,639
um yes

2577
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:58,260
hi can you hear me

2578
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:00,960
yeah we can hear you we can see you go

2579
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,100
for it

2580
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,739
yeah cool thank you yes hello this is

2581
01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:06,900
Heinz Bryant uh joining from Intel and

2582
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:08,340
I'll quickly talk about the future

2583
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:11,699
possibility to initiate building trust

2584
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:14,159
for the modern internet and please go to

2585
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:17,159
the slide one the next slide

2586
01:37:17,159 --> 01:37:19,380
all right cool so following end-to-end

2587
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:21,960
principle we're proposing an L7 protocol

2588
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:24,300
to help achieve trustworthy web services

2589
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:27,900
called the testable HTTP or attack or

2590
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:31,860
httpa each GPA is simply an HTTP

2591
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:35,100
extension for binding remote adaptation

2592
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,460
messages to http headers and it

2593
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:41,520
establishes trusted communication for

2594
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,100
web services running Insider trusted

2595
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:47,960
execution environment or tea or tea

2596
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:51,360
T is considered an emerging Computing

2597
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,360
resource for web services however httpa

2598
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,179
is not specific to T endpoint

2599
01:37:57,179 --> 01:38:00,900
by extending HTTP we're proposing a

2600
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:04,739
fundamental method called HTTP test

2601
01:38:04,739 --> 01:38:07,739
and that set of ADD test header line for

2602
01:38:07,739 --> 01:38:10,800
standardization this can not only be

2603
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,159
used for unilateral agpa but also Mutual

2604
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:19,500
to uh for um for Mutual agpa to build L7

2605
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:22,260
trusted end-to-end communication

2606
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:25,280
next slide please

2607
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:28,739
all right and here is some background

2608
01:38:28,739 --> 01:38:30,679
about the

2609
01:38:30,679 --> 01:38:33,659
agpa we have Market demands for

2610
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:35,940
trustworthy web services however and web

2611
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:38,880
services are mostly not tested also

2612
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,980
notice that we are sailing into the new

2613
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:44,159
era not just protecting data in transit

2614
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:46,739
or storage but also protecting data in

2615
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:49,800
use in addition a great example is T

2616
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,139
which is an emerging technology that

2617
01:38:52,139 --> 01:38:54,719
protects data in use and it is a

2618
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:56,940
reasonable endpoint for HTTP message

2619
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,440
exchanges

2620
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,900
t as an emerging resource for web

2621
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:03,659
application to leverage and there is a

2622
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:06,179
need for unifying remote annotation

2623
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:09,900
using te for Hep protocol and next slide

2624
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:12,019
please

2625
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,020
and here's a quick comparison between a

2626
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:18,960
GPS and a GPA although both of them

2627
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,719
provide end-to-end security they have

2628
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:23,520
different granularity levels for

2629
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,500
defining an endpoint

2630
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:29,280
https needs CA certificate authority to

2631
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:33,120
build trust with the website and also

2632
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,100
note that it is most likely the website

2633
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,560
Gateway not the web service itself

2634
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,400
and httpa works with trusted authority

2635
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,920
to build trust with the web service run

2636
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,159
inside the team directly users can

2637
01:39:47,159 --> 01:39:48,960
authenticate the identity of the web

2638
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,940
service to build trust by remote

2639
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:54,420
adaptation remote adaptation is the key

2640
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:57,000
method we propose to verify a sort of

2641
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,120
all sort of identity of software or

2642
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,460
hardware for finer granularity

2643
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:04,219
Authentication

2644
01:40:04,219 --> 01:40:07,020
httpa workflow includes four major

2645
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:08,940
transactions including PreFlight

2646
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:10,620
transaction a test hidden shape

2647
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,719
transaction a test secret provisioning

2648
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,100
transaction and the trustage

2649
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:17,940
communication transaction and httpa can

2650
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:20,400
stand alone to build its own secure

2651
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,800
communication we call this secure

2652
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,260
communication on the attested Node

2653
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:27,600
trusted communication

2654
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:31,380
for some strong T users can only trust

2655
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:33,540
the web service itself even without the

2656
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,880
need to trust the CSP to use the web

2657
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,940
service for their sensitive data even

2658
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:40,920
though the middle box at the middle

2659
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,199
point in between such as an application

2660
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:46,139
Gateway is compromised due to something

2661
01:40:46,139 --> 01:40:48,540
like TLS termination or maybe something

2662
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:51,000
else the information is still protected

2663
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,840
and because the protect information can

2664
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,360
only be decrypted inside the teeth if

2665
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,400
you want to encrypt every bit of the

2666
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:03,840
message you can also use hcbba over TOs

2667
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:06,659
however httpa doesn't rely until as to

2668
01:41:06,659 --> 01:41:08,340
build secure communication

2669
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:12,120
with httpa users can regain the right to

2670
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,699
verify security assurances inside the

2671
01:41:14,699 --> 01:41:17,280
hardware and software and the freedom to

2672
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,159
choose who or right to trust or and most

2673
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:22,320
importantly to regain the control on

2674
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,360
their own data

2675
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,659
okay

2676
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:28,920
yeah we just have a question in the

2677
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:33,780
queue hi Eric Escuela um so just to look

2678
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:34,679
at this diagram there's still a little

2679
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:36,360
puzzled by something how much of the web

2680
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:39,540
server is running in the T all of it

2681
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:41,820
oh that's a good question so in this use

2682
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:44,460
case we simply demonstrate one but uh I

2683
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:46,080
think you are asking the scalability

2684
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,600
that is another uh implementation

2685
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,300
details here but this in this case is

2686
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:52,380
one

2687
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:54,840
no sorry that's right um what I'm asking

2688
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,080
is is the web server is the entire web

2689
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,540
server running in the T or is only a

2690
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:01,860
tiny bit of the web server writing of

2691
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:03,719
the T

2692
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:07,800
oh so it could be either one depends on

2693
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:12,060
how you design the web service let's go

2694
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:14,659
okay

2695
01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:17,580
um we have someone else in the queue as

2696
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:19,619
a clarifying question

2697
01:42:19,619 --> 01:42:20,400
um

2698
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,840
sort of

2699
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,880
I would recommend if it's not a

2700
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:26,280
clarifying question we wait there it's a

2701
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:27,900
clarifying question in the form of I

2702
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:30,060
want to understand how this works

2703
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,199
okay

2704
01:42:31,199 --> 01:42:33,540
um so hi Alex surehowsky I mostly was

2705
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:35,060
curious

2706
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:37,560
what why we are doing this rather than

2707
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,360
doing a testable TLS so like my mental

2708
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,699
model for how normally you use these

2709
01:42:41,699 --> 01:42:42,900
things is that you perform a remote

2710
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,699
attestation using your credentials to

2711
01:42:44,699 --> 01:42:46,080
some sort of maybe centralized service

2712
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,300
in order to get an unlock key for a

2713
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:49,800
certificate and then you could use our

2714
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,840
certificate for mtls or maybe an oauth

2715
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:52,980
assertion or something else which would

2716
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:54,420
let you centralize the number of

2717
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:55,679
services would have to be worried about

2718
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:57,659
the attestation and then you could sort

2719
01:42:57,659 --> 01:42:59,159
of use more existing Primitives that we

2720
01:42:59,159 --> 01:43:01,139
have today in terms of the existing

2721
01:43:01,139 --> 01:43:03,060
authentication Frameworks in order to

2722
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:05,400
have you know presented a delegated

2723
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,600
Trust of you know something already

2724
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:07,920
verified this assertion that you're

2725
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,780
talking to something trusted and I'm

2726
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:12,239
sort of wondering what we get as a

2727
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:13,800
benefit by going and putting this at the

2728
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:15,540
HTTP layer because now it seems that

2729
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:16,860
every service needs to be aware of the

2730
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:20,040
attestation and I'm not sure I see the

2731
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,540
benefit or like how this would be used

2732
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:23,960
in the wild

2733
01:43:24,659 --> 01:43:27,239
yeah so so they so that so the key

2734
01:43:27,239 --> 01:43:30,480
motivation is to build the trust inside

2735
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,639
the T

2736
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:35,639
um so we don't want to trust any things

2737
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:38,040
outside of T so they'll hope that the

2738
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:40,199
group decryption all the process can

2739
01:43:40,199 --> 01:43:43,080
happen inside the T and the best way to

2740
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:44,880
do that is to

2741
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:48,119
um implement this at the high level like

2742
01:43:48,119 --> 01:43:50,400
L7 level

2743
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:53,580
um for the protocol rather than need to

2744
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:56,280
trust something else that where the

2745
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:00,060
decryption happens outside the T and I

2746
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:02,400
think basically that's the intuition

2747
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,860
no I don't think it does because you

2748
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:06,900
could simply implement the TLs Mutual

2749
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:10,020
authentication inside the T

2750
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:14,639
uh yes you could and however in that

2751
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,280
sense you have to

2752
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,860
um Implement all those tall things

2753
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:22,500
inside the uh probably the application

2754
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:25,920
Gateway however if you do that to your

2755
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,500
uh some application web services behind

2756
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,020
in the back end

2757
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,239
um and then that would be hard to

2758
01:44:33,239 --> 01:44:36,000
realize in the modern in Cloud

2759
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,219
infrastructure because it would be hard

2760
01:44:38,219 --> 01:44:42,020
to uh to have the application Tail as

2761
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:46,260
tunneling directly back into the into

2762
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:47,940
the web service

2763
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:49,739
sorry so to restate what I think you

2764
01:44:49,739 --> 01:44:52,739
said your goal is to be able to have an

2765
01:44:52,739 --> 01:44:55,440
untrusted Gateway which sees the

2766
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,179
requests

2767
01:44:57,179 --> 01:44:58,980
that passes them to a back end which

2768
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:01,440
could be a t which goes and does the

2769
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,300
verification

2770
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:04,980
yeah and you don't want to do something

2771
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:06,900
like you know sni-based routing or

2772
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,360
anything else

2773
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,719
those routing can happen that that's

2774
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:14,420
fine because

2775
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:18,300
we hdba does not prohibit that from

2776
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:20,639
happening that's true can happen

2777
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:23,219
but what we care about is the sensitive

2778
01:45:23,219 --> 01:45:25,500
information inside the HTTP message

2779
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,900
which don't want to protect it make sure

2780
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:30,239
the confidentiality or the Integrity of

2781
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:33,540
the message is protected

2782
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:36,060
okay so so the unchastic Gateway can

2783
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:39,920
still operate on the things thanks

2784
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:44,639
um Dave Taylor You've joined the queue

2785
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,560
okay we just have one more slide so if

2786
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,179
you want to go just to your last slide

2787
01:45:48,179 --> 01:45:50,280
hands and then we can start the queue

2788
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,480
properly

2789
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:53,580
yeah so here we're just thinking about

2790
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:56,219
uh where do we go for this work and I

2791
01:45:56,219 --> 01:45:59,580
hope that we have a protocol application

2792
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:02,639
Level protocol to allow people to use uh

2793
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:05,159
T resources in the future for their

2794
01:46:05,159 --> 01:46:08,059
application that's it

2795
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:12,119
okay thank you Dave uh Dave Taylor

2796
01:46:12,119 --> 01:46:14,580
um among other things chair of the teeth

2797
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:17,159
working group which is on the slide and

2798
01:46:17,159 --> 01:46:19,560
also currently the technical advisory

2799
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,420
Council chair in the confidential

2800
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:22,560
Computing instruction that deals with

2801
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,060
tees

2802
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:26,760
um I've seen at least five different

2803
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:31,020
proposals in uh CCC meetings around

2804
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:32,820
people doing a tested TLS so this is

2805
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:34,560
following up on Alex who said a bunch of

2806
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,119
what I was going to say

2807
01:46:36,119 --> 01:46:37,440
um at least five five different

2808
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,940
proposals for doing it I think all of

2809
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:40,500
them were doing HTTP over the top of it

2810
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:42,000
and so they were basically doing what

2811
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,100
Alex was saying five different ways and

2812
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,139
the feedback was get some unification

2813
01:46:46,139 --> 01:46:47,400
and then take the drafts and bring them

2814
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,080
to iitf and so I think some of those

2815
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,460
drafts will be mentioned in the rats

2816
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:52,500
working group uh Steve working groups

2817
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,060
here I would say I don't think tip is

2818
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,080
the right place because that's for

2819
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,000
provisioning as opposed to the actual

2820
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,739
communication here

2821
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:01,860
um uh attested fill in the blank rats is

2822
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:03,659
a good working group to review it rats

2823
01:47:03,659 --> 01:47:05,580
by itself does not do protocols under

2824
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:08,280
the current Charter what it does is it

2825
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,440
can just like you know the DHC working

2826
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,600
group does not do all possible DHCP

2827
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,580
options other groups can right so they

2828
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:15,719
would review stuff but it wouldn't

2829
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:17,820
necessarily be there that is the best

2830
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:19,500
home to take the discussion to right now

2831
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,900
so yes for for taking it there they

2832
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,699
might say do it in a different working

2833
01:47:23,699 --> 01:47:24,840
group

2834
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:27,840
um or maybe TLS or whatever but as far

2835
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,540
as putting stuff in the tee uh to what

2836
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:31,800
Alex is saying I've seen a bunch of

2837
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,179
people actually using stuff in

2838
01:47:33,179 --> 01:47:34,739
deployment right now the way that Alex

2839
01:47:34,739 --> 01:47:36,900
was saying with HTTP over the top of a

2840
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:40,280
tested TLS so thanks

2841
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:43,560
okay Martin Thompson

2842
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:46,199
uh this item is on the agenda for SEC

2843
01:47:46,199 --> 01:47:48,600
dispatch later this week it was on this

2844
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,920
agenda for five minutes we've already

2845
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,600
blown well past that one I suggest we

2846
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,280
take this discussion to that other

2847
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,619
meeting where we have a group that is

2848
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:56,880
much better suited to answer the

2849
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,940
questions

2850
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:01,440
okay we are running early on the agenda

2851
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:04,320
so I'm less concerned about the time but

2852
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,179
note your point that this is being

2853
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:07,739
presented later in the week which is the

2854
01:48:07,739 --> 01:48:08,880
point of having it here to make sure

2855
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,560
everyone's aware

2856
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:12,000
okay

2857
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,100
um sorry I don't yeah you're at the

2858
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:17,360
queue go for it

2859
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:20,699
so hi this is Hank

2860
01:48:20,699 --> 01:48:23,520
um despite what they've said

2861
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:26,639
the Reds working group may do protocols

2862
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:29,400
if it's not feasible to use existing

2863
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:31,199
protocols

2864
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,420
so then that's okay

2865
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:36,000
um which would for me initiatively say

2866
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,060
Go to http definitely first and if you

2867
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:40,500
have had a stable remote accession

2868
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:43,920
questions then real Reds in but but the

2869
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,920
HTTP part should be the first gateway

2870
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:50,520
function I guess yeah that's all

2871
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,860
okay thank you there's no one else in

2872
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:54,480
the queue so we'll just say thank you

2873
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,219
very much Hans for presenting this as we

2874
01:48:56,219 --> 01:48:58,380
said it is on the agenda for sex

2875
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:00,900
dispatch and https it was presented here

2876
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:02,820
just to share and make sure more people

2877
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:04,739
are aware of it so that is the end of

2878
01:49:04,739 --> 01:49:06,420
everything we've run through in dispatch

2879
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:08,880
before you run off and enjoy some coffee

2880
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,440
um just to say thank you to our

2881

2883
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,080
