1
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,219
oh

2
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,720
one give it a minute or two we have time

3
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,640
I I think we're gonna have to hold it

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,620
because this does not

5
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,459
Define

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,379
so while we are waiting another minute

7
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,239

8
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,219
big QR code thingy up there or your

9
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,960
laptop one of the two so we get accurate

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,940
counts of who's in the room it's

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,960
important to get a big room

12
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,560

um we are your chairs with and Joey

32
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,199

33
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,720
a reminder for the people the new

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,360
arrivals to scan the QR code to make

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,040
sure that you are signed in the blue

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,560
sheets next slide please

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,099
all right so let's begin by mentioning

38
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,540
the note wheel

39
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,860
um which I'm sure most of you are

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,260
already pretty familiar with either with

41
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,180
the at this ITF meeting or at the

42
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,099
previous ones

43
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,379
um this is to highlight

44
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,840
um for you guys to remember that

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,340
um there could be some legal

46
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,640
repercussions right or some legal

47
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,040
implications to some

48
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,980
um actions here right to keep it to keep

49
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,920
that in mind right Wes

50
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,360
next slide please

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
and then the second part of the note

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,599
will is to highlight some important BCPS

53
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,180
uh like BCP 54 that includes the code of

54
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,459
conduct which is uh mentioned in the

55
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,760
next slide

56
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,080
all right so the most important thing

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,480
here is to continue treating everybody

58
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,659
with respect this group has constantly

59
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,239
been quite respectful right so let's

60
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,040
keep that going

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,760
um let's try to speak slowly and clearly

62
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,080
remembering that not everybody is an

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,700
English native speaker

64
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,120
right uh so on that on that's on that

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,980
note and also

66
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,760
um

67
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,819
uh let's not be afraid to ask somebody

68
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,180
to repeat themselves or ask slower or

69
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,480
speak more clearly all right uh similar

70
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,519
reasoning for whenever we are discussing

71
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,500
stuff right and well a couple more notes

72
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,920
up there next slide please

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,579
yep

74
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,860
um so here we have some dance

75
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,840
information right pointing to the data

76
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
tracker the mailing list uh hopefully

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,580
you've all already survived I mean

78
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,540
subscribe to it

79
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,019
and also hopefully you will survive the

80
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,239
mailing list discussions

81
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,939
um and yeah hopefully you've also read

82
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,399
uh at least the abstracts of the of the

83
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,440
three drops that the working group is

84
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,759
currently dealing with next slide please

85
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,560
um so another reminder that this session

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,240
is being recorded and very very

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,280
important for everybody to remember to

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
wear your masks

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,780
um unless you're actively at the mic

90
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,960
right and then uh in that case it will

91
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,820
be optional

92
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,340
um so here this couple of notes for both

93
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,740
in person and remote participants

94
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,660
and I think we can proceed to the next

95
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,979
slide

96
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,280

109
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,680
um so we're going to start off with the

110
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,540
sort of the current document status and

111
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,340
then talk about working group activity

112
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,740
level discussions a little bit as we

113
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,660
always do and then the two presentations

114
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,160
we have today are sort of one is about

115
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,360
the architecture and the other is about

116
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,880
sort of some dance use cases

117
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,139
um we'll have an open mic for anybody

118
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,759

119
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,620
then if you guys don't use it all of the

120
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,520
time

121
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,380
the scary chairs are going to introduce

122
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,660
a topic because because you guys didn't

123
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,120
give us enough agenda material

124
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,340
so uh what's our current document status

125
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,340
we have three documents one is the ietf

126
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,199

127
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,020
other are the TLs Dane client ID and the

128

and you support them

146
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,960
uh we need active counts of who has read

147
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,360
it the mailing list activity is still

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,460
generally you know pretty slow there was

149
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,080
actually a fair amount in September but

150
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,620
only three in October and and they were

151
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,240
announcement related stuff not actually

152
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,639
active discussion and uh zero in August

153
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,080
but everybody takes vacation in August

154
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,460
so

155
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,220
um we still wonder you know uh maybe

156
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,720
there's just not that much to do but we

157
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,400
have so many interesting use cases we'd

158
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,940
love to see them discussed more

159
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,500

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,740
we can take the next slide we're going

172
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,139
through the documents

173
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,979
uh the way I see us sorting out the

174
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,479
documents because I have a big problem

175
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,120
with the current architecture document

176
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,120
is to have one

177
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,940
document that covers the general idea of

178
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,180
dancing right an architecture document

179
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,780
and then we have documents now about

180
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,919
secure dancing meaning the TLs changes

181
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,060
and I would like to see how to dance a

182
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,340
document that is if I have my own

183
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,000
protocol how would I implement this how

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,039
would I write a document what are the

185
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,520
requirements for applying dance to

186
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,580
all kinds of protocols

187
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,720
then we have dancing with Wes or Joey or

188
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,740
something else

189
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,560
that is protocol specific currently the

190
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
architecture document I'll have a little

191
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,580
bit of everything I think Ash has just

192
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,580
collected all kinds of information you

193
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,299
know

194
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,240
rather unstructured way and I would very

195
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,360
much like to organize up that

196
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,320
so this is how I see us sorting out at

197
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,540
least the horse addiction architecture

198
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,920
document that I'm struggling with next

199
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,100
so it's a mess as I make sure a lot of

200
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,899
things and

201
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,720
I can definitely go in and cut out a lot

202
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,820
of stuff but then I need some responses

203
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,700
I can do pull requests or something so I

204
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,480
need

205
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,399
someone to step forward say yeah let's

206
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,080
do that

207
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,580
uh

208
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,940
we have one pull request now that will

209
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,640
add a lot of information on lauravan I

210
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,140
would like that to be a separate

211
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,320
document on how to dance with lauravan

212
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,260
and maybe have just a small use case

213
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,519
mentioned

214
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,300
in the architecture document yeah we

215
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,279
have someone in the queue

216
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,180
Rick go ahead

217
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,540
hi my name is Rick Moran I'm a modern

218
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,940
dancer but also I was with this group

219
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,860
when it was founded lost track of it I'm

220
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,540
afraid

221
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,040
um what we discussed in the beginning is

222
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,260
will be really attractive to have users

223
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,300
just people behind browsers or behind a

224
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,640
milltool to also be able to use

225
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,620
something that t less and authenticate

226
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,680
towards towards an end point I didn't

227
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,360
find it back in the architecture would

228
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,640
search it such an extension be welcomed

229
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,959
is that the sort of thing you're asking

230
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,160
about

231
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,160
sorry I think once again

232
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,519
um the dance standards speak

233
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,660
predominantly about devices that

234
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,720
register as clients it doesn't speak of

235
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,540
end users people sitting behind desks

236
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,459
and that is the sort of thing we

237
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,760
discussed okay I have a slide coming up

238
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,560
on that okay

239
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,180
um so in this direction we've done a lot

240
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,160
of architecture work and we might be

241
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,700
able to help uh

242
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,880
dmess or upmiss the spec great

243
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,640
I mean that's basically how I entered

244
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,620
into this because I had been spending

245
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,440
too much many years in Sip and then see

246
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,779
if we have user related things and I

247
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,760
think this could be beneficial facility

248
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,800
but we need to have some concern there

249
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,940
as well

250
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,920
so that was my starting point in this

251
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,360
so yes okay we have our candidate to

252
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,860
help me next slide please

253
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,279
uh I've seen in the documents we have

254
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,920
that all of them refer to a very flat

255
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,140
namespace and I talked with some of the

256
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,620
DNS gurus that I regularly meet for

257
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,540
various reasons from fish and ships to

258
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,899
real DNS discussions

259
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:20,940
and they say that well you really want

260
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,680
to consider that if you're going to have

261
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,380
a lot of entries you may not need a flat

262
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,079
namespace you need a tree of some kind

263
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,560
like enamor ptrs for DNS to be able to

264
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,540
manage this properly

265
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,360
uh for me this is how to dance a

266
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,640
requirements document for setting up

267
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,540
various records types and so

268
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,000
next

269
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,480
and if we like Rick Mansion producers

270
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,459
into dancing

271
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,459
then we really need to consider how we

272
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,880
can protect the privacy of these uh

273
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,860
I've checked around and talked with

274
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,180
people and

275
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,300
there are a couple of documents

276
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,860
describing ways to handle this by

277
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,980
putting hashes into DNS instead of

278
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,620
saying oag at Edwina net or something

279
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,779
like that and this could also be

280
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,600
mentioned in the requirements document

281
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,480
on protocol implementation

282
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,740
next

283
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,899
Rick is the queue I don't know

284
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,779
if you want to oh yes absolutely sorry

285
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,180
I don't know if it's okay to interrupt

286
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,060
Rick from Ryan modern dancer

287
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,279
um one one other way typical of keyless

288
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,140
a records would be to have a root

289
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,339
certificate Authority that's

290
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,240
representing their plans yep

291
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,560
cool let's discuss that

292
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,519
Brendan

293
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,320
hello I just want to know if you have

294
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,279
seen RFC 6920 naming things with hashes

295
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,980
it's a surprise Uris containing hash

296
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,160
extensions great I think this is just

297
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,339
experimental or informational so okay

298
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,019
well it just seems relevant RFC 6920

299
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:06,240
1620. I'll get that from the notes thank

300
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,440
you

301
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,000
next

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,320
or

303
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,740
did we have go ahead Paul sorry I'm not

304
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,000
too customer

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,279
um just just a check on the previous

306
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,079
comment I'm actually the author of this

307
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,760
RFC

308
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,160
um there is some subtlety there because

309
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,680
with SMTP on the email level There's

310
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,260
issues where Paul with a capital P is a

311
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,579
different endpoint and Paul with a

312
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,260
lowercase p and in DNS you have no K

313
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,660
sensitivity so so there are some more

314
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,980
complications if you're doing anything

315
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,740
with users mapping to DNS

316
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,560
great we have a lot of input for writing

317
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,660
that properly thank you

318
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,519
so

319
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,160
now I'm stepping on shimon's toes a

320
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,779
little bit here but I prepared him for

321
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:56,279
that uh the the clients are document uh

322
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,040
we could take into a implementation

323
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,839
requirement document

324
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,860
but since we're entering uh last call we

325
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,980
may have to reconsider that it was just

326
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,360
an idea

327
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,360
uh we need to find candidates people

328
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,579
that can help us write protocol specific

329
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,579
documents so we at least get a few up on

330
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,079
the table early

331
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,480
so we can test our ideas

332
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,000
and focus on where we have energy in the

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,579
group not just all the ideas that was in

334
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,339
the original architecture document

335
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,500
we need at least one for the underscore

336
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,720
service and one for underscore device

337
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,180
one document each

338
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,959
one example if we still want them both

339
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,880
and maybe discuss if we want some other

340
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,320
tags

341
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,959
I'm kind of hesitant for underscore

342
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,279
service because it kind of

343
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,740
syntactically is very close to the tags

344
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,260
used for SRV records and it's only half

345
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,380
the tag for SRV we have service and

346
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,760
protocol

347
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,519
and right now the document refers to

348
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,860
that registry but only use half of it

349
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,300
and we need to figure out if there are

350
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,600
other patterns we can use not only email

351
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,660
addresses or device IDs or so

352
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,660
uh how to code an identity into a DNS

353
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,579
name

354
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,420
but uh as well said we need energy so we

355
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,699
maybe we should try to get more

356
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,160
practical closer to the real application

357
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,639
problem we do need a TLS extension so

358
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,880
Sherman a big thank you for promoting

359
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,920
that and moving that forward but

360
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,540
uh now we need to start looking to rest

361
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,000
next

362
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,279
I know that there was some code

363
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
somewhere at some point

364
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,480
I lost track of it

365
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,500
but do we need to prepare some cool

366
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,680
stuff happening maybe a hackathon next

367
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,120
to ATF

368
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,839
and look into some libraries like I mean

369
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,199
this won't get anywhere unless open SSL

370
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,279
and the libraries people use have it

371
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,420
so curl open SSL some server some co-op

372
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,980
libraries

373
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,839
something

374
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,480
need to figure out how this works and

375
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,360
how big changes we need to do to the

376
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,740
existing platforms

377
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,440
okay yeah see what that was

378
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,199
any questions that is the last slide any

379
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,779
discussion on the architecture document

380
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,360
um originally in the charter during the

381
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,120
buff we agreed that the uh the

382
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,620
architecture document would be part of

383
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,180
the deliverables but we knew that the

384
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,680
other ones were sort of you know much

385
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,259
more done but this really describes the

386
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,959
use cases that most people had a hard

387
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,339
time wrapping their head around by just

388
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,839
reading the protocol documents so hence

389
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,639
this is an important one Jim

390
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,880
hi Jim Fenton um as I was reading

391
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,320
through the architecture document I got

392
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,759
to this section on use cases and I

393
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,720
thought oh great this is going to

394
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,220
describe the problem that we're solving

395
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,099
and it seems to just dump jump right

396
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,780
into details without describing the

397
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,020
problem so I'd like to suggest that some

398
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,959
use case information you know you know

399
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,299
probably the problem statement therapy

400
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,839
be included somewhere yep I mean those

401
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,000
details is the stuff I want to move to

402
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,099
the other documents I'm proposing

403
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,140
to make the architecture more an

404
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,080
architecture overview

405
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,620
foreign

406
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,660
so I think I'm going next so I have a

407
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,160
bunch of comments on your slides so

408
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,840
should I do it up up front because I'd

409
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,539
like to watch I use lights later

410
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,660
that might be easier okay you're cool

411
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,020
okay

412
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,640
Michael Richardson so

413
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,320
um one of the things I quickly noticed

414
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,820
today

415
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,500
was that there are other documents don't

416
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,000
actually reference the architecture

417
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,419
document

418
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,380
um that might be intentional so that

419
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,000
they don't get caught

420
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,620
in that

421
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,840
um but I suspect it should be a

422
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
normative reference

423
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,539
um but that's a decision to make about

424
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,799
what we're doing

425
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,960
so so let me ask a follow-up question to

426
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,100
that

427
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,840
um I don't remember the intended status

428
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,640
of the architecture document but there's

429
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,140
a good question whether it be proposed

430
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,299
or informational

431
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,280
and I think I could make arguments

432
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,539
either way so I will let the working

433
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,940
group decide what to do but

434
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,799
is there something in the architecture

435
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,600
document that should be normatively

436
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,820
referenced like you cannot and you

437
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,140
cannot do or implement the other

438
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,900
protocol pieces without it without

439
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,120
having read it that it's the having read

440
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,220
it that's the point it's you know so we

441
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,500
may not have protocol content uh but

442
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,240
generally they're informative not not

443
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,020
pro not proposed and so referencing them

444
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,520
non-normatively is okay

445
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,200
um so just something we should think

446
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,020
about before we get too far

447
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,480
um for the simple reason that if we

448
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,100
suddenly change things then we're going

449
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,100
to change our our timing uh and our

450
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,380
process for these documents so I think

451
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,820
that's an important part so that's a

452
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,220
good point so can I ask you a favor and

453
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,940
on the mailing list respond I'm with the

454
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,220
last call comments about okay I'm going

455
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,020
to say exactly that yeah so but I

456
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,760
thought it should be useful to do that

457
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,320
as well

458
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,440
um the the other thing that that I I

459
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,720
wonder about and based upon my

460
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
understanding of where we're going is

461
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,740
that one of the things that this is

462
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,299
totally unrelated sorry

463
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,919
um second comment

464
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,760
um

465
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,280
one of the the scenarios that we

466
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,640
imagined is that a manufacturer creates

467
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,580
device populates it with certificate

468
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,039
which they populate into manufacturer's

469
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,740
DNS Zone

470
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,679
and device says I am device 4378 blah

471
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,720
blah blah blah and that gets us out of

472
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,840
the whole a lot of our our issues

473
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,280
okay so that's a kind of

474
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,260
well-established pattern

475
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,140
the question is are there scenarios

476
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,559
where owner operator of device actually

477
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,780
wants to own that zone

478
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,760
and I think that it doesn't matter from

479
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,500
the other end's point of view from the

480
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,620
the there what it is but if that is that

481
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,360
if it is a scenario that we want to

482
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,200
support

483
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,620
then we probably need to decide somehow

484
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,140
it goes somewhere and I'm actually not

485
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,059
sure that it's not another document or

486
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,520
I'm not even sure it requires any text

487
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,400
but it is a different pattern of who

488
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,039
trusts who and

489
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:38,700
um

490
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,440
and it also matters who you're talking

491
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,440
to and there was a bunch of of comments

492
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,900
about you know browsers and this kind of

493
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,679
stuff

494
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,620
I'm pretty sure that

495
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,340
I'm not going to get a browser with a ID

496
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,340
in google.com if it's Chrome

497
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,100
right so I'm pretty sure that the

498
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,140
browser use case if someone has that

499
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,080
that the DNS identity that I assert as a

500
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,080
client is going to be in my zone or in

501
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,600
some friendly zone so that's a case of

502
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,059
that that I think that if that's the

503
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,440
space we want to go into that it

504
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,299
immediately invokes that other other

505
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,740
piece of space

506
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,480
I think the important thing to remember

507
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,679
from a dance work item point of view is

508
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,080
what in order to support these use cases

509
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,700
and I think all of your use cases are

510
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,200
wonderfully valid and should go into the

511
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,860
architecture document as possibilities

512
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,140
what use cases require changes or

513
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,960
additions to the DNS or the DNS protocol

514
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,020
itself or the TLs protocol so the

515
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,159
interesting thing is that I don't think

516
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,520
there's any on The Wire changes I think

517
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,940
it's conceptual changes and as to what's

518
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,220
going on and so I think it's more subtle

519
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,840
that's why I think it's difficult to

520
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,799
decide

521
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,159
whether what we need to say because in

522
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,159
some ways there's nothing to say right

523
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,200
um it just works it should just work but

524
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,240
but suddenly says well but hang on here

525
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,039
what's the what's the relationship that

526
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,020
I have or what are the other things and

527
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,100
I think we're going to get Security

528
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,020
review feedback

529
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,220
on that question and so either we say as

530
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,840
little as possible

531
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,419
or we wind up having to say a lot

532
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:22,679
well it kind of borders to BCP but your

533
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,200
question is basically I mean if I have a

534
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,480
device ID and the manufacturer creates

535
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,600
an entry and I want to take over that if

536
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,580
I create an answer should it be my zone

537
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,020
or should I've been

538
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,900
his uh we need to figure out what we

539
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,380
want right and do we allow to concurrent

540
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,380
the entries in different DNS for the

541
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,000
same device

542
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,980
I don't think we can even we I don't

543
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,500
think we can even control it right in

544
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,480
particular I could go and copy your

545
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,100
entries out of your Zone and put them in

546
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,620
my zone without your knowledge

547
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,080
um that may be meaningless foreign

548
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,000
ownership from the manufacturers it's

549
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,799
very complex but yeah I think we should

550
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,600
mention it absolutely

551
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,159
we have a couple protocols for doing

552
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,659
that but and that's where I'm actually

553
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,140
coming from ah yeah thank you so Joey

554
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,100
just pointed out this is a great

555
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,419
discussion for the mailing list that

556
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,460
doesn't have enough traffic on it so uh

557
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,080
Michael let's start a thread please and

558
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,700
Ben

559
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,580
hi I want to support what Michael was

560
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,059
saying that if if we don't have a clear

561
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,760
solution to this problem dance risks

562
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,320
creating an enormous amount of E-Waste

563
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,120
gener and generally making the sort of

564
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,280
obsolescence and lock-in problems of iot

565
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,820
works because

566
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,799
it creates an authentication Paradigm

567
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,280
where the device can only authenticate

568
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:51,539
to anything if uh if it is if the Zone

569
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,539
the manufacturer zone is still live

570
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,179
basically and if the manufacturer goes

571
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,280
out of business or drops this product

572
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,900
line then the device is bricked so I

573
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,760
really think we should not end up in

574
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,760
that situation and I do think that there

575
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,299
is some actual protocol level work to

576
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,120
talk about there

577
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,059
for example being able to con ask the

578
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,440
device in a standard way what is your

579
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,120
what is your tlsa

580
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,480
and potentially for example defining a

581
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,659
profile that really says you use the

582
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,299
Dane ee mode because the other modes are

583
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,080
not as portable

584
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,400
okay I think that's a good point too

585
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,559
um I mean the Tails extension covers

586
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,480
that a little bit too

587
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,200
um

588
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,720
again having these discussions on the

589
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,159
mailing list would be absolutely

590
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,500
fantastic and I think I think one of the

591
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,520
takeaways that I heard from this

592
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,919
conversation personally is there may be

593
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,600
elements of

594
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,640
the architecture document that might

595
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,140
actually pull into some of the protocol

596
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,700
documents to make sure that the protocol

597
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,640
document is Standalone enough so

598
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,740
especially I hope you might have

599
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,840
guidance you know with that of what

600
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,179
pieces might be injectable into the

601
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,000
other ones if we feel that the last call

602
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,919
is not a readable document on its own

603
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,480
that's an important I would personally

604
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,580
like to focus on those should take your

605
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,400
documentary get in that into shape by

606
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,799
throwing out bits and pieces and leave

607
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,360
the leftovers somewhere else in the

608
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,240
GitHub repo and then we'll start working

609
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,640
with the bits and pieces

610
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,039
but trying to get an architecture

611
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,740
document that is easy to read and get an

612
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,480
overview of the protocol like we said

613
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,380
earlier

614
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,419
the solution

615
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,159
I don't quite remember but

616
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,380
was the GitHub repo uh

617
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,059
studying the additional resources for

618
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,340
this draft because if it's not then it

619
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,080
would be very very good to put it there

620
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,600
architecture document I'm still have to

621
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,120
force Shimon to bring his documents into

622
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,919
the same GitHub repo

623
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,559
and so we have everything in there but

624
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,279
feel free to go in there and

625
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:11,960
do pull requests and help us

626
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,000
okay thank you very much thank you uh

627
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,620
shiman you don't have slides right

628
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,699
that's mirror collection

629
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,820
thank you

630
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,860
yeah I don't have science am I ready to

631
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,320
go okay

632
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,159
um

633
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,400
so uh although I may refer to all those

634
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,200
slides if you don't mind so you may want

635
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,059
to put those back

636
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,220
um so before I start I just wanted to

637
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,720
before I forget I wanted to quickly

638
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,179
mention uh to all those questions about

639
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,919
implementations

640
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,340
uh AF Nick the French registry actually

641
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,620
has one so I think Sanders if you're

642
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,900
here you are yeah he may want to mention

643
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,700
that when he speaks later on

644
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,700
so I just want to put in a plug for that

645
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,299
uh on uh all those points so the

646
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,299
architecture document I agree it's a

647
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:22,140
little bit unstructured uh in my view it

648
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,000
was intended generally to be a general

649
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,419
framework to describe how things use

650
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,059
uh dance not about specific application

651
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,400
use cases but over time what happened

652
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,260
was people

653
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,360
to kind of describe how the things work

654
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,919
they had to describe applications so

655
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,960
that's why iot came in and various other

656
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,240
things and I think one of the prop

657
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,220
challenges is the application

658
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,720
architecture for iot may be

659
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,000
significantly different from something

660
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,520
else like SMTP Transport Security or

661
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,340
Sith for example so that makes it a

662
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,679
little bit challenging so we should take

663
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,140
in that into consideration if we want to

664
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,360
as you suggested separate

665
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,820
we have a separate architecture document

666
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,460
and a use case document so we need to

667
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,500
figure out how how those two would work

668
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,000
in concert

669
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,539
so that is my comment about that

670
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:13,620
um

671
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,000
so

672
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,659
um on always assertion that most of the

673
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,720
our docs document a flat namespace

674
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,240
I don't actually think I agree with that

675
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,360
um the record name format specifically

676
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,279
defines a structure that is very

677
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,100
amenable to hierarchical structure right

678
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,000
so

679
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,020
uh I would like to Olay to read the

680
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,059
document and tell me if you disagree and

681
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,279
I can explain to you why that is we can

682
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,080
elaborate and I can show you examples

683
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,600
maybe the couple of examples that we

684
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,440
gave

685
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,480
show something that looks like a

686
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,340
non-hierarchical namespace but it's

687
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,919
perfectly amenable to doing supporting

688
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,179
that

689
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:55,919
and both the examples both the

690
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,440
server-specific identity and the device

691
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,360
specific identity those are the two

692
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,279
examples uh that we put in

693
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,020
which is

694
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,400
um I don't remember if any of the

695
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,840
current documents really discuss

696
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,120
handling transfer of ownership so when a

697
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,520
device moves from you know one

698
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,919
manufacturer to be owned by an

699
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,840
institution that that or that wants to

700
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,340
overtake the

701
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,440
the client authentication yeah they

702
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,820
don't right so that's a good thing so

703
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,820
that would be an iot iot architecture

704
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,620
specific discussion

705
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,299
uh that doesn't belong in the two

706
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,520
protocol documents I wrote belongs

707
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,840
somewhere I think

708
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,140
so that's a very good point

709
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,080
um as far as the email like record name

710
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,960
formats I think Ole has affect where

711
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,940
you're coming from is the Sip user case

712
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,100
which uses those types of identities

713
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,760
so um again the draft uh if you read the

714
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,100
draft carefully it's not prescriptive

715
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,799
about the record name format so it shows

716
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,059
two examples

717
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:04,020
none of them uh hashes any component of

718
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,720
the client identity because the two

719
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,480
examples were a service uh specific

720
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,039
identity and a device identity

721
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,320
presumably those are not as privacy

722
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,840
sensitive so if a Dane client

723
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,039
application we're using uh email like

724
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,039
identities or sip user agents I think it

725
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,539
would be perfectly appropriate for them

726
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,399
to use the what about the truncated hash

727
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,320
formats that you have in your document

728
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,200
and and ask my absurd is the other one

729
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,720
that uses that format I think right

730
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,740
so

731
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,580
um

732
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,960
if

733
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,020
if it helps to include an example

734
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,899
of such a record name

735
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,520
then

736
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,740
we can do that I have no objection to

737
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,080
doing that sorry parlocks uh just you're

738
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,059
referring to the the open PHP hashing

739
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,620
mechanism yeah that's not a privacy

740
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,500
mechanism that's just a normalization so

741
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,640
you can

742
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,200
you shouldn't be using that as a

743
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
security that's a

744
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,820
masking or hiding identity property it's

745
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,320
definitely not meant for that okay fair

746
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,659
enough no security right

747
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,399
okay yeah so there's an open question

748
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,980
then if you're using applications that

749
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,140
have privacy sensitive client identities

750
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,600
should we use should you be using this

751
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,820
protocol at all right so that's another

752
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,080
question

753
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,100
um I'm not going to answer that now

754
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,260
people want to weigh in on that please

755
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,059
do so

756
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,700
are you in the queue yeah

757
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,320
um yes it would be helpful to have an

758
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,100
example for a client at using uh youth

759
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,799
at domain name example okay

760
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,799
um personally I would also be interested

761
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,899
to have something that's not for a

762
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,600
specific service like I'm happy but also

763
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,340
to have something that just says in

764
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,200
general I use all sorts of protocols and

765
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,120
this is the identity I'm using this is

766
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,760
the Dane record that specifies it I do

767
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,880
not care or do not feel that it's uh in

768
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,159
line with my privacy to publish all sort

769
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,200
of protocols I'm using so maybe

770
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,059
something with a wild card that might do

771
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,860
this sure yeah it's a wild cards and

772
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,840
Dane ta is one way to solve that right

773
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,940
so yeah I feel really care because World

774
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,360
Cup's really difficult but yeah yep sure

775
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,020
um

776
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,260
so yeah I guess the question is that

777
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,520
discussion does that belong in the

778
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,559
protocol document or some application

779
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,059
architecture document we have to figure

780
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,100
that out right

781
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,760
um all right so let me

782
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,860
uh

783
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,960
Okay so

784
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,200
your other comment about uh the uh

785
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,840
service specific identity only including

786
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,419
one half of an SRV record that's true

787
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,120
that was deliberate because we thought

788
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,640
it probably won't be the case that a

789
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,140
client would have

790
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,279
uh distinct security credentials for

791
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:49,200
distinct transport protocols UDP or DCP

792
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,480
right so if you want to make a case that

793
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,520
they should and then we should design a

794
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,080
record name format that accommodates

795
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,720
that we can discuss that it's just I

796
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,340
didn't think there was a need to do that

797
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,140
um

798
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,840
okay so I think that's the bulk of my

799
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,419
comments back to you Olay and feel free

800
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:14,820
to uh engage us on suggested changes to

801
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,120
the core protocol documents their last

802
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,640
call but you know we can take additional

803
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,620
feedback and and adapt them as needed

804
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,360
all right I'm Victory syndicate

805
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,560
oh yeah Victor

806
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,950
[Music]

807
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,799
Victor go ahead

808
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,580
hear me

809
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,620
in the last meeting the topic came up of

810
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,019
having yet another TLS extension that

811
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,059
asks servers to solicit a client

812
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,580
certificate I haven't had a chance to

813
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,080
progress that uh is there still need or

814
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,039
interest in seeing that move forward

815
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,520
ah very good question Victor yeah I

816
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,679
think you anticipated

817
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,440
something I was about to say so Michael

818
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,239
Richardson and I just had a chat about

819
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,719
this prior to this meeting and we do we

820
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,520
were intending to put out a draft so

821
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,839
this is the

822
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,739
TLS extension to explicitly solicit a

823
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,359
Certificate request message from the

824
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,080
server is that right

825
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,119
I was uh

826
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,520
Victor uh

827
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,739
agreed but yes we are planning to write

828
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,899
that I think there's several people

829
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,760
uh who have come up with use cases for

830
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,480
that we do intend to do that I was gonna

831
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
make an attempt to put it out before

832
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,918
itf115 I failed

833
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:56,040
uh but we will do it uh the question is

834
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,520
that extension is more General in nature

835
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,020
than dance

836
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,320
so should it go to the TLs working group

837
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,780
or where should that work be done so

838
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,580
that's there is an open question about

839
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,920
that

840
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,839
is an excellent question I think the

841
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,579
dance chairs will have to climb it

842
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,820
closely

843
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,099
how do we get the document out and then

844
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,020
we can negotiate between the dance

845
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,520
chairs and the TLs chairs where the best

846
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,500
place for it to actually be published is

847
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,119
okay right here's a personal document

848
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,740
for now and then

849
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,020
okay great that sounds good to me it's

850
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,339
hard to talk about a document that's not

851
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,839
written yeah I agree

852
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,099
um and

853
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,560
I think that's all I had oh there's one

854
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,660
last topic so the other thing that's

855
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,480
come up a few times is uh the suggestion

856
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,260
about

857
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,300
doing uh Dane Klein authentication

858
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,460
another way such as

859
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,560
moving the authentication to the

860
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,500
application layer using TLS exported

861
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,660
authenticators and Channel Finding

862
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,599
uh I don't think I didn't see any

863
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,000
appetite for uh

864
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,579
for for uh

865
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,980
proposing such a mechanism but anyone

866
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,079
wants to do that that's there's an open

867
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,119
question there right but I I don't think

868
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,160
we're planning to do that right now

869
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,078
putting it in the TLs deck go ahead

870
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,500
so this is so that uh right now the pr

871
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,420
authentication happens in the TLs layer

872
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,460
right so there's a mechanism

873
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,680
well TLS exported authenticators where

874
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,780
you can do it at the application layer

875
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,640
and then communicate the results back

876
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,079
and bind it to the TLs Channel

877
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,020
underneath right so that makes it

878
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,859
um

879
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:39,720
there's a set of use cases like I can't

880
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,579
remember all of them but if you want to

881
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,240
do things like uh

882
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,980
you know authenticate with a different

883
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,140
certificate later rather than a

884
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,760
different identity later in the Taylor

885
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,339
stream or a variety of other things you

886
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:56,460
can do that right so the problem I think

887
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,460
this poses for dance clients is

888
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,400
that each application has to complicate

889
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,960
their infrastructure by implementing

890
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,520
this authentication of the app layer

891
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,220
rather than just punting it to the TLs

892
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,900
layer right it's it's easier for

893
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,180
applications there may be some benefits

894
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,800
of security advantages

895
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,300
to the applicational layer

896
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,460
authentication architecture but

897
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,520
uh I don't I don't see anyone jumping uh

898
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,740
up and proposing to do it that way right

899
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,960
so

900
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,579
Victor you have an open mic but not a

901
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,400
queue there we go go ahead

902
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,020
um right on that topic uh you know if we

903
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,240
were to attempt to authenticate let's

904
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,839
say uh email users to their submission

905
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,980
service

906
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,740
uh then indeed an application layer

907
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,660
authentication makes a bit more sense

908
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,280
and then one would want such a mechanism

909
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,579
to ultimately be a sassal mechanism uh

910
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,339
leveraging tls's export capabilities and

911
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,079
so on so we would design a new Cecil

912
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,260
mechanism that incorporates today on the

913
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,240
other hand if we're talking MTA to MTA

914
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,140
uh then the current kind of ntls that

915
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,700
client auth makes more sense

916
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,599
yep thanks

917
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,839
uh and I think that's all I had

918
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,320
right

919
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,480
all right sorry

920
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,339
um Rick foreign I I'm still figuring out

921
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,440
what you mean exactly but when it hits

922
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,680
upon authentication and extracting

923
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,560
either identities or keying material I'm

924
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,900
very eager to look at that at least and

925
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,579
not say no at this point

926
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,440
sure okay yeah let's have a chat about

927
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,720
it later and then we can we can discuss

928
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,940
thanks

929
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,980
uh maybe also

930
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,540
um talking a bit more about it in the

931
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,320
mailing list your mom

932
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,280
hi my name is sandosha and today this is

933
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,260
one of the use cases for the dance

934
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,500
working group so lauravan is a long

935
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,079
range wide area network it is the iot

936
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,320
technology that comes under the lp van

937
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,720
range LP van is local right area network

938
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,200
so here we are using the technology as

939
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,020
low very low bandwidth next track please

940
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,099
so

941
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:36,720
lauravan also has the usual challenges

942
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,619
like in other iot Technologies where the

943
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,660
key needs to be shared with different

944
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,740
stakeholders so these are the root keys

945
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,320
for the device which needs to be shared

946
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,780
with different stakeholders who will be

947
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,820
operating at the IP end

948
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,540
so that is a problem and that is a

949
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,579
problem for all most of the iot

950
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:03,240
Technologies so next slide please

951
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,060
so this is the architecture for lauravan

952
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,359
it's a star topology where we have the

953
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,119
end device and the end device is

954
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,220
connected to the radio Gateway via the

955
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,660
Laura technology

956
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,760
and after that uh in the internet side

957
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,099
we have different stakeholders a

958
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,079
different servers sorry the NS is the

959
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,540
network server JS is the joint server

960
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,240
and the as is the application server so

961
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,700
there are cases these different servers

962
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,940
can be operated or managed by same

963
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,920
stakeholders or could be operator or

964
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,619
managed by different stakeholders so

965
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:42,560
what happens is that

966
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,480
there are two keys here root Keys here

967
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,520
one is the network key and the

968
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,640
application key so the network key and

969
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,280
the application key is with the device

970
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,400
during the manufacturing stage and after

971
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,760
that those two keys are AES 128-bit

972
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,940
symmetric Keys has to be shared with the

973
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,040
stakeholders in the internet side either

974
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,560
the network server needs to have the

975
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,960
network key the application server needs

976
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,200
to have the application app Root key so

977
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,160
yeah so this enables so the price

978
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,500
sharing is needed to enable the iot

979
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,680
device onboarding so the com once the

980
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,740
for communication the the communication

981
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,540
between the end device and the network

982
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,300
server is encrypted why are the session

983
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,060
Keys generated by these Network root key

984
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,920
and the communication between the end

985
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,920
device and the application server is

986
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,160
encrypted by the session Keys generated

987
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,839
by the app key

988
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:46,079
so that is for end-to-end but uh for

989
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,599
this to be done we have the JS which is

990
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,599
the join server it acts as the AAS

991
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,760
server authentication and authorization

992
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,579
server so the network server and the AS

993
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,579
application server needs to communicate

994
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:01,140
with the Js

995
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,720
so for this they need to do Mutual

996
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,839
authentication and as per the lorovan

997
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:08,760
specifications

998
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,579
how the network server for example the

999
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,680
network server and the joint server

1000
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,380
mutually authenticate each other is not

1001
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,140
normative so it is up to the

1002
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,240
implementer's point of view how how they

1003
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,020
do that

1004
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,300
so

1005
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,520
what we try to do is that we wanted to

1006
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,060
do with the web pki when we wanted when

1007
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,680
we do with the whip pick I and the

1008
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,619
certificate Authority model uh we found

1009
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,859
out certain issues for example from a

1010
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:41,520
cost point of view Laura is like one

1011
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,220
euro per year and if we need to buy a

1012
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,140
certificate for doing this much Mutual

1013
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,900
authentication then that is an issue

1014
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,400
another issue is that the protocol stack

1015
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,200
that this network server or the

1016
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,599
application server uses they don't have

1017
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,240
the ca bundle as in the case of the web

1018
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,380
browsers

1019
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,200
so also we were not able to use

1020
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,839
certificates like let's encrypt because

1021
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,920
here the device here the identification

1022
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,260
is hierarchical and it's like a Mac ID

1023
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,740
we had which has 16 digits and it is

1024
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,020
possible that there is a point between

1025
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,780
these 16 digits and so let's couldn't do

1026
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,839
it more than eight labels so these are

1027
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,119
the different issues that we found out

1028
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,760
so the solution was that using selfline

1029
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,839
certificates

1030
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,880
but when we use self-signed certificates

1031
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,819
what happens is that uh there is a

1032
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:40,500
requirement for all the servers in in

1033
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,380
this ecosystem needs to get from one

1034
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,339
root CA and that is an issue so next

1035
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:49,500
slide please

1036
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,060
so Dane Comes This Dance architecture

1037
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,560
and the Dane client ID and Lane

1038
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,460
certificate authorization drafts comes

1039
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,940
as a solution for this issue where we

1040
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,540
need not have a single root CA we can

1041
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:10,260
have Federated Cas and each of these C

1042
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,200
ecosystem or the servers could have

1043
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,540
could create self-signed certificates

1044
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,380
but could authenticate between the

1045
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,079
servers in the different ecosystem based

1046
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,300
upon

1047
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,900
client or add an identity so we had an

1048
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,460
implementation and this implementation

1049
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,480
has been presented during the ietf 113

1050
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,859
and my colleague here a gal he has

1051
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:43,279
implemented that and next slide please

1052
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:48,000
excellent sorry so I I'm not going into

1053
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,980
the details of this because these are

1054
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,380
already been implemented so my colleague

1055
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,400
here he took the go library of uh Dane

1056
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,960
tlsa authentication that is done by

1057
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,680
Shimon and he developed it and uh he

1058
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,480
implemented both the client ID and the

1059
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,180
client certificate draft so these are

1060
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,180
the details of what has been done

1061
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,740
so

1062
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,980
this we we were able to test with the

1063
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,420
different uh servers which had a root CS

1064
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,220
from different certificate authorities

1065
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,680
of self-signed certificates and were

1066
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,940
able to mutually authenticate each other

1067
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,040
each other so that was a point that was

1068
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,980
one that's why we are here because it

1069
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,099
proves that uh the Dane uh the dance

1070
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:39,420
working group uh documents uh or the

1071
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,480
work enables Mutual authentication with

1072
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,140
the Federated CS and uh yeah ID of one

1073
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,540
on five next slide please

1074
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:53,460
we were sorry yeah uh this is not

1075
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,740
actually client-side authentication but

1076
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,960
uh because for the I from the end device

1077
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,140
point of view uh it needs the server

1078
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,480
needs to be authenticated so my

1079
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,819
colleague here implemented that also he

1080
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:08,220
tried to send the DNS authentication

1081
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,220
chain from the server side to the device

1082
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,640
even though the network is very

1083
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,040
constrained we were we fragmented the

1084
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,119
complete uh chain to so that the device

1085
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,819
can authenticate the server but I think

1086
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:26,460
this is not part of the dance chart on

1087
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,980
it

1088
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,700
so that's any questions

1089
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,800
okay thank you for the excellent use

1090
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,099
case is uh anybody have questions about

1091
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:40,280
it

1092
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:44,339
I see people leaning but not standing

1093
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,099
okay I think that's good

1094
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,440
um Joey

1095
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,200
we have 15 minutes left

1096
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,240
do you think the dance working group is

1097
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,500
ready for

1098
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,780
The Talk

1099
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,380
I think it's time to get scary

1100
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,380
foreign

1101
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:15,319
I hope that sounded ominous

1102
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,040
no is there a way to force meet Echo to

1103
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,300
reload slow

1104
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,900
where is the reload button

1105
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,500
thank you

1106
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:02,880
it did not reload the rate list

1107
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,720
it's not ready to be shared

1108
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,740
pretty scary

1109
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,119
well I can do it through screen sharing

1110
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,000
too is the other option so

1111
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,079
I will do that

1112
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:30,560
yeah I'll I'll do a screen sharing

1113
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,359
too scary yes

1114
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,900
foreign

1115
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,819
so

1116
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:48,319
we need to discuss something

1117
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,180
about how Protocols are made

1118
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:56,400
and

1119
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,800
they they go through many changes you

1120
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,940
may have noticed that that we're

1121
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,500
changing a little bit as we as we move

1122
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,359
toward last call and and things are

1123
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,920
developing and changes are happening

1124
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,079
see first off protocol start is just

1125
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,660
this fledgingly of specification and

1126
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,700
they're not able to dance yet they have

1127
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,500
they haven't actually

1128
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,900
done much in life they're brand new

1129
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,280
and so first they must learn to

1130
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,900
interoperate and play nicely together

1131
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,060
and they get together and they play and

1132
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,980
they learn how to behave and be nice

1133
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,240
I found a bunch of pictures of not nice

1134
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,400
that I did not put on this slide but um

1135
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,240
it was tempting

1136
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,619
eventually

1137
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,780
specifications decide what they want to

1138
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,819
be when they grow up and they they

1139
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:47,280
really mature and that's what last call

1140
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,440
is all about right we push these

1141
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,940
specifications to the point where they

1142
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,520
know what they're going to do in life

1143
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,560
this is what we hope this is what we aim

1144
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,180
for

1145
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,980
um but I searched for work by the way I

1146
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,660
just have to call this out the one on

1147
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,160
the left you know the minor came up and

1148
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,720
I thought well Bitcoin miner that's you

1149
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,099
know like it's perfect that's that's a

1150
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:08,119
protocol sorry

1151
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,800
but to reach

1152
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,640
adulthood

1153
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,200
it requires testing it requires

1154
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,420
compatibility it requires making sure

1155
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,300
that things work well together

1156
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,540
and that is that is critical so

1157
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,660
we scary chairs have a few questions

1158
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,040
even if you answered some of these

1159
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,359
questions before in fact we've just

1160
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:32,640
heard a couple in the presentations I

1161
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,260
encourage you to answer them again but

1162
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,700
I'm I'm looking for commitments I'm

1163
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,900
looking for who's actually done

1164
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,160
something I'm actually feeling like I'm

1165
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,420
running my second buff for the day

1166
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,760
because I just ran one last session and

1167
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,020
now I have some questions they're going

1168
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,079
to sound very buff-like

1169
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,540
so in the beginning

1170
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,760
we need implementations so I actually

1171
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,980
have you know questions of because it's

1172
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,420
been working on implementations on the

1173
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,579
client side on the server side are there

1174
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:58,260
any obstacles we've had some stuff at

1175
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,540
the hackathon

1176
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,920
so the

1177
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,640
hold up

1178
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,579
thank you so one of the first questions

1179
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:23,040
is I am planning on implementing Dane

1180
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,500
Technologies right you're an implementer

1181
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,900
I'm going to put it into the counting

1182
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,940
Cube because I'm curious how many people

1183
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,020
out there

1184
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,119
are actually going to actively work on

1185
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,460
this if you do not raise your hand that

1186
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,599
means that you are intentionally

1187
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,400
prohibiting and going to get in the way

1188
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,260
of somebody implementing so just don't

1189
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,819
don't use the do not raise hand button

1190
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:44,420
it doesn't make sense

1191
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,960
that is true Christopher go ahead and

1192
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,220
talk if you're raising your hand that

1193
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,599
way otherwise you're clicking the wrong

1194
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:03,500
raise hand button

1195
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,520
this is not my first buff today I'm

1196
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,900
experienced and I know why people did

1197
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,079
that

1198
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,579
all right so excellent so that actually

1199
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:19,319
shows 11 people that are you know

1200
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:21,240
actively working on deploying or

1201
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,619
implementing I should say dance

1202
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:24,180
Technologies I think that's very good

1203
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,920
although there's eight people that I can

1204
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,480
get in your way so I watch out for them

1205
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,700
but

1206
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,740
okay great

1207
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,020
is there anybody that wants to speak to

1208
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,400
the challenges of oops did I just make

1209
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,819
the slides

1210
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:42,839
anybody that wants to speak to the

1211
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:45,000
challenges of of anything you

1212
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,800
encountered that wasn't a surmountable

1213
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,940
no okay

1214
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,920
well I'm not directly uh answering your

1215
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,140
question but I was just reminded that uh

1216
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,780
I think Robert Moskowitz uh

1217
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,640
dropped in some questions earlier today

1218
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,640
about Dane and did we

1219
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,099
about dance and did we address them

1220
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:12,900
um

1221
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,559
I think one of them was he wanted to ask

1222
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,780
whether we should Define a new Dane

1223
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,520
usage mode and

1224
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,380
Michael already answered and I think I

1225
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,079
agree with him I don't see any need it's

1226
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,500
probably going to be Dane e or Dane ta

1227
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,020
so unless there's a compelling rationale

1228
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,119
for new semantics associated with the

1229
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,520
Dane usage mode I don't think we need

1230
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,359
one

1231
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:37,920
yeah I think that's an excellent

1232
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,780
question and I I had the same

1233
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,760
brain thinking wow I hadn't thought of

1234
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,920
that but um okay but I just wanted to

1235
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,559
ask aloud to see if anyone else had any

1236
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,839
contrary thoughts

1237
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:51,839
and the second question uh was a little

1238
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,339
bit more interesting

1239
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:56,280
he asked whether we need to define a new

1240
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,280
Dane selector for seabor encoded

1241
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,960
certificates

1242
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,359
and that one I'm not sure I have an

1243
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,859
opinion on

1244
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:06,540
but uh

1245
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,579
like to see if anyone else does so right

1246
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,359
now

1247
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,420
if I recall the Dane spec has two

1248
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,220
selectors

1249
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,520
one is the full certificate in endure

1250
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,119
format and one is the subject public key

1251
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,880
info in their format or or a raw public

1252
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,619
key there's nothing else

1253
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:30,420
I wanted to say there was more than one

1254
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,040
I'm sure Victor will Shaman and give us

1255
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,420
an exact list off the top of his head

1256
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,160
but yep there he is is there are there

1257
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,020
three really Victor why don't you answer

1258
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,940
the question since I'm blanking on it in

1259
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,520
front of a room indeed

1260
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,680
uh there are only two selectors it's the

1261
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,099
public key and the full binary blob uh

1262
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:49,440
the binary blob I guess is defined to be

1263
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,619
der uh but really I don't think it was

1264
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:54,780
necessarily the case that it must be

1265
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,839
there it's just the full certificate in

1266
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,760
whatever form it appears in so we could

1267
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,119
make that clearer or Define a new

1268
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,260
selector

1269
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,480
um is seabor supported in TLS you see

1270
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,359
the tlsa record is TLS specific

1271
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,420
if seabor is outside TLS then the whole

1272
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,660
question is kind of moot right because

1273
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,599
it's no longer tlsa

1274
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,780
um so I've never seen TLS use Seaboard

1275
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,160
coated certs

1276
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,480
uh so I don't know what we're talking

1277
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,140
about exactly

1278
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,760
I mean so I think Victor your point is

1279
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,319
perfect right if you're if you're doing

1280
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:34,079
the whole blog or even just the key then

1281
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,599
it doesn't matter because we are taking

1282
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,540
a we're taking it at its word right we

1283
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,520
don't actually specify what the encoding

1284
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,540
of The Blob is

1285
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,040
um Rick

1286
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,040
fluorine I'm so eager about client

1287
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,440
certificate recognition I already have

1288
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,720
to implemented in a TLS demon where I go

1289
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,940
all the way look up sap record and

1290
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,119
showing dnsack looking up an ldap server

1291
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:04,559
parsing what's in there and so on and so

1292
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,180
on I'm really eager to rip that out

1293
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,339
because nobody's using it and I would

1294
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:09,480
very much like to have something as

1295
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,760
simple and elegant as this excellent

1296
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,380
okay

1297
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:17,059
uh any other comments on that

1298
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:19,500
I think we probably have time for one

1299
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,119
more question then so my next question

1300
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,740
is going to be I am planning on

1301
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,480
deploying dance

1302
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,040
so

1303
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,140
we need operators right we need people

1304
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,480
that actually you own a dnsl and you own

1305
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,920
something rather where you can actually

1306
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,660
make use of dance technology I don't

1307
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,420
care if it's a gigantic infrastructure

1308
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,440
you know a company that's going to

1309
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,480
deploy millions of iot devices or if

1310
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,220
you're just going to use it you know in

1311
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:44,959
your small operational Network

1312
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,540
foreign

1313
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,940
could mean I plan to never deploy dance

1314
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,319
that might be the way to think about it

1315
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,180
note that you can unclick and you can

1316
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,680
you know

1317
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,020
choose to do nothing as well which is

1318
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,520
meaning you're not going you're not sure

1319
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,700
yet

1320
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,140
okay I think that looks pretty good

1321
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,780
um as I

1322
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,300
said in the last buff I just drilled we

1323
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,619
don't actually attract operators here

1324
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:33,839
much you know the ITF is not an operator

1325
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,460
convention so

1326
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,960
um having having any is actually

1327
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,760
somewhat of a good sign

1328
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,380
um if anybody wants to stand or raise

1329
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,780
hands to speak to how they are planning

1330
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,059
on using it um aside from we've seen

1331
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:47,059
some you know presentations in the past

1332
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:49,079
anybody that hasn't spoken yet that

1333
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:50,579
wants to give a quick description we'd

1334
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:53,180
love to hear it

1335
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,480
thank you

1336
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,859
foreign

1337
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:04,800
with no hands I think we are near end of

1338
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,020
time so I'm going to give Joey the

1339
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:10,280
microphone so she can close us out

1340
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,240
um well I guess we can just close for

1341
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,780
now with yet another reminder to try and

1342
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,720
keep the oh we have somebody here

1343
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,579
all right

1344
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,319
good idea

1345
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:33,000
you need to ask if if there's

1346
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,200
participants that want to discuss

1347
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,819
something

1348
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:39,660
well uh what topics do you think should

1349
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,400
we should be discussing at the interim

1350
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,440
and are there other people that feel the

1351
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,680
same way

1352
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,400
you put it another way the chairs are

1353
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,020
always happy to hold meetings that's

1354
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,940
never a problem Michael Richardson the

1355
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,319
microphone so I think the short of it is

1356
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:03,480
that we need to have deadlines earlier

1357
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,880
than March and virtual interims are good

1358
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,339
ways to do that we had a lot of

1359
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:10,200
discussions about things about the hat

1360
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,740
to go to the list and this and that and

1361
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,059
that you know usually motivates people

1362
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:16,500
so what are the topics pretty much

1363
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,940
everything we talked about I think that

1364
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,740
the architecture document and the other

1365
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,200
use cases we're not in uh we are in

1366
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,299
working group last call for some of them

1367
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,579
so that may be appropriate after that

1368
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:28,920
point to deal with whatever issues that

1369
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,619
we can't res authors can't resolve

1370
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:33,180
so I wouldn't mind seeing two virtual

1371
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,339
interims before the next ietf that would

1372
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:36,660
be my goal I think we would make much

1373
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,520
better progress that way

1374
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,740
okay that's good I mean so we are your

1375
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,960
chairs and we will do whatever the group

1376
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,940
wants in at your behest so it sounds

1377
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,780
like

1378
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,839
probably January for an interim

1379
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:51,420
um and what we will do is propose that

1380
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,040
people pitch topics for they actually

1381
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,260
want to discuss right so we actually

1382
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,619
drug you guys drug agenda items out for

1383
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:01,099
this one in probably even the last hour

1384
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:04,020
so we need we need stuff more in advance

1385
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,880
uh it's very hard to put together an

1386
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,220
agenda at the last second so

1387
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,799
yeah I guess uh the very least it could

1388
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,140
be a follow-up on the topic streamon was

1389
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,359
uh telling us about

1390
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,760
um but yeah just like we said it will

1391
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,960
definitely be mostly up to you guys

1392
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,180
all right so then that seems to be it

1393
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,619
for today

1394
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:28,440
um thank you everybody and see you next

1395
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,619
time
