1
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,519
um

2
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,759
all right I'm gonna give you guys a

3
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,020
minute and then we'll get started

4
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,340
so Roman

5
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,200
thank you

6
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,200
yes

7
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,759
oh

8
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,780
is

9
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,140
that

10
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
um

11
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,400
okay we'll get started in in one minute

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,800
but while while I give you the one

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,140
minute for the couple folks who are

14
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,480
trying to get settled we do need a

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,040
second note taker

16
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,239
we cannot get started because

17
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,599
the one note taker is new and has not

18
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,340
taken ietf notes before

19
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,940
well that quieted the room

20
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,980
so I will take that as a sign that we

21
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,260
can go ahead and get started

22
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,319
at least with some of the logistics so

23
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,700
uh

24
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,379
good afternoon

25
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,959
good morning and good evening to all of

26
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,060
those who are here present and

27
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,980
participating remotely

28
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,700
you are in the remote attestations and

29
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,379
procedures

30
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,860
um working group so if you join remotely

31
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,200
or in this room and are not expecting to

32
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,760
talk about rats you may be in the wrong

33
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,900

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,580
my co-chairs as an individual

79
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,320

I will take backup notes but not having

89
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,639
chat means it's probably

I did not even notice that

91
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,259

144
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,279
eat authors do not believe any further

145
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,779
changes are needed

146
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:20,700
um as a draft 17. so a few uh comments

147
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,899
on that so next slide please

148
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,440
next slide so the this this is a I'm

149
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,000
going to take a few minutes and discuss

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,360
the the the major changes in draft 17

151
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,940
just in case to point them out

152
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,660
um uh so one of them is that the nonce

153
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,459
was made optional

154
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,160
um and uh that's so you can use time

155
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,360
based there were some general uh

156
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,380
improvements around

157
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,640
um

158
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,860

yeah so we lost the slides here some

160
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,519
general improvements around uh freshness

161
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,560
in the nonsense

162
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,560

there we go

173
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,180
we're good Ned

174
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,279
that's interesting it looks better on

175
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,740
the remote before that but okay I won't

176
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,899
yeah I won't project something with the

177
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,339
browser so back back one slide please

178
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,399
so the uh um the other thing that was a

179
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,620
change uh this is these are the semantic

180
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,300
changes you know that would affect

181
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,820
actually actually affect the code you

182
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,519
write as an implementation

183
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,000
um so uh another change was the uh the

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,360
input to the digests for a

185
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,839
sub module uh detached Digest

186
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,060
so the there was a more more clear

187
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,920
specification on that

188
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,640
um

189
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,700
uh we also changed the way that sub

190
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,860
module digests are identified I mean

191
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,779
this has got to do with the

192
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,880
how things are in seabor and Json and

193
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,579
the fact that Json doesn't have tags so

194
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,339
that's another the implementation is a

195
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,959
lot cleaner now there was some

196
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,360
overloading before

197
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,640
um and then the security level claim was

198
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,440
removed so these are the major

199
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,760
implementation changes uh next slide

200
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,860
then there were uh lots of wording

201
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,100
changes uh just clarifications

202
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,100
um uh we describe eat as a framework

203
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,740
right up front you know that that uh

204
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,820
uses profiles it's uh kind of

205
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,459
you know that came a lot a lot from the

206
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,320
comments from Elliott we need to

207
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,760
redirect to the right security model

208
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,380
right away so we're not trying to

209
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,200
describe the security model in eat

210
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,360
um the sub module section was Rewritten

211
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,820
for clarity and brevity there was a

212
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,360
couple sections removed that were uh you

213
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,100
know not necessarily essential like

214
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,019
describing how you how to include public

215
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,240
uh public keys and claims

216
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,519
um mentioned of the CTI and jti claims

217
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,040
it was just advice that was removed

218
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,320
uh there's a clarification that submods

219
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,120
can be used for both evidence and

220
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,680
results

221
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,779
um and then we added non-normative

222
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:40,019
reference to UCCS um so we you know we

223
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,779
had UCCS in there as a kind of a

224
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,579
normative reference that it was gone and

225
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,459
now it's back as non-mormative

226
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,920
that's uh and then uh next slide um

227
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
which is

228
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,779
um security considerations and privacy

229
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,360
uh considerations were updated so

230
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,220
there's a section on freshness and

231
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,779
security considerations there's a

232
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,980
section on

233
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,399
claim trustworthiness uh and then

234
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,680
there's also some discussion about CTI

235
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,500
and GTI that was removed

236
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,959
so with that I'm going to jump into open

237
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,880
issues and see how far we can get on

238
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
these

239
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,579
next slide

240
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,459
um

241
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,300
so uh

242
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,220
the eat authors believe no changes are

243
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,560
needed to resolve any of the issues the

244
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,360
following issues

245
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,220
you know that's not to say there will

246
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,779
never be another change to eat of course

247
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,040
but um

248
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,199
uh so next slide

249
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,380
and I believe we're now into

250
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,959
uh the uh lots of slides individual

251
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,060
slides one per issue

252
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,720
um

253
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,079
uh the spreadsheet issues uh numbers one

254
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,660
through seven were taken care of at the

255
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,519
virtual interim so we're kind of picking

256
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,760
up where we left off there

257
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,959
um so this is uh uh Issue Number Eight

258
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,839
um from that list that spreadsheet list

259
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,320
um uh uh and I'm going to describe the

260
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,019
issue and then stop for comments

261
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,620
uh so we hopefully can close it out

262
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,940
uh here at least uh in the room

263
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,100
um and then you know I guess we wait a

264
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,899
little bit for comments on the list so

265
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,060
it's also there but these these also

266
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,519
this basically parallels the email I

267
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,320
sent about a week ago with a big list of

268
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,120
issues so

269
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,399
okay so Issue Number Eight

270
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,980
um uh Elliot in his review uh was

271
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,199
concerned about the software name field

272
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,260
being freeform it doesn't it's just a

273
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,420
text field where you put whatever you

274
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,459
want in

275
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,639
um we uh after Elliot's comment we

276
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,440
improved the wording in draft 14 to make

277
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,980
it clear that this is uh definitely a

278
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,019
free form field

279
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,000
um and don't expect it to be structured

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,459
or any kind of rigorous definition and

281
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,360
if you want a rigorous definition

282
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,699
for uh software that you can really

283
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,100
strong identifiers or Clara identifiers

284
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,060
use spdx Cyclone DX or ghost with their

285
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,639
art lots of other options there so this

286
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,579
is probably more of a human

287
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:23,699
uh human readable software name

288
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,120
so that this has been around uh

289
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,920
there's been no feedback on this one way

290
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,720
or the other so um

291
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,000
no objections no comments no nothing

292
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,820
back from Elia so so uh let's stop for

293
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,959
comments on on that

294
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,420
okay we're gonna take no comments as

295
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,339
approval by the way thumbs up from Dave

296
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,079
yep

297
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,620
okay okay thanks next slide please

298
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,720
uh

299
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,699
I don't remember what the comment was on

300
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,380
number nine but uh it was about security

301
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,940
level and security level has been

302
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,920
removed so

303
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,060
I think that settles that

304
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,779
Roman

305
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,099
um

306
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,399
so I did not track that so we removed

307
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,139
the claim outright from the document yes

308
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,060
it's gone and so the early registration

309
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,639
we have for it we just want to disappear

310
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,459
it was never never registered early ah

311
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,339
perfect forgot that thank you yeah we

312
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,680
only registered a small set remember

313
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,240
yeah

314
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,380
okay next slide please

315
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,779
so in the in this one uh Elliott had

316
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,240
requested improved wording on the dloa's

317
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,259
claim

318
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,180
just clarifications I don't think it was

319
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,079
anything of substance um so that uh

320
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,160
that wording was improved in draft 14

321
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,220
which was published in July and so no

322
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,799
comments since so I'm just gonna pause

323
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,599
you here for a second

324
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,220
um so

325
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,900
thank you taro

326
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,119
the chat is now working so those are

327
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,919
remote if they want to provide comments

328
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,459
can do that that way as well

329
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,619
okay thanks

330
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,520
so uh we consider this uh nothing no

331
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,020
further action needed here so

332
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,760
comments

333
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,380
okay

334
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,380
uh

335
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,360
uh so and then uh back around I think

336
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,240
Elliott requested the edition of claims

337
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,220
that uh these are actually manifest

338
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,160
software manifest claims for spdx and

339
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,720
Cyclone DX

340
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,240
uh those claims were added in draft 14

341
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,780
those also include uh I think it's Co-op

342
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,660
and uh my uh content types for those two

343
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,880
so the E document registers content

344
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,740
types for those in order to be able to

345
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,900
reference them in manifests

346
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,919
uh so no comments since July on that so

347
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,760
okay manifests is a plugable thing so

348
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,840
you can

349
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,580
if you don't like these you want want

350
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,360
more you can do that

351
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,520
uh so

352
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,960
um next issue

353
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,900
lost it and then we lost

354
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,419
so I'm gonna keep talking um so that was

355
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,940
section section 9.2 was a bunch of

356
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,460
information we collected very early on I

357
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,740
remember discussions in Montreal about

358
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,720
what characteristics claims should have

359
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,620
should we reuse old formats or or what

360
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,780
and it was it was a good discussion so

361
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,820
that was captured and and that text was

362
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,160
all put in section 9.2 in the Ina

363
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,840
section

364
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,380
um but it's not really expert review

365
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,059
uh and it's not setting any criteria

366
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,440
it's just

367
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,820
kind of advice to people creating claims

368
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,059
so uh the I believe uh Elliott and

369
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,860
somebody else said that you know Ayanna

370
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,780
would not know what to do with this I

371
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,100
think Diana looked at it and said we

372
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,140
don't know what to do with this so just

373
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,179
moved all of that text to an appendix

374
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,640
that's not normative that was done in

375
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,220
draft 14.

376
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,679
if there is a GitHub issue open related

377
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,740
to this that I will get back to

378
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,100
but this this really pertains it to it

379
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,379
not being directed at Ayanna anymore

380
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,039
okay

381
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,100
uh next

382
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,400
Ned left and came back so okay you

383
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,660
should be back

384
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,940
um so Elliot had a section in his

385
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,860
comments that he titled minor issues and

386
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,299
knits

387
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,740
um most of them were directed against

388
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,220
against the introduction uh uh he

389
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,840
considered the minor

390
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,480
um uh but we did do major work on the

391
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,080
introduction in drafts 14 15 and 17. so

392
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,660
I think the introduction is uh

393
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,580
much cleaner now and

394
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,260
you know

395
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,419
orients the readers more now that this

396
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,600
is a framework and that um it's we're

397
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,280
not defining the security model here

398
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,860
that the security model is elsewhere and

399
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,720
you know expect to understand profiles

400
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,360
and and uh that profiles our core part

401
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,120
of the work here so

402
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,100
uh I think that should more than address

403
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,919
Elliot's comment

404
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,720
comments

405
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,100
okay next

406
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,320
uh so spreadsheet Issue Number 14 to

407
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,480
number 15 we're both uh we're comment

408
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,340
blocks one from honest and one from

409
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,740
Michael the spreadsheet didn't list them

410
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,500
all out individually and um

411
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,140
um so uh but there were lots of really

412
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,419
helpful comments we most of them were

413
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,120
wording clarifications and and uh

414
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,320
I guess they've led to some other other

415
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,900
uh changes like I think the public key

416
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,120
removal was in there and the and all

417
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,200
that

418
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,640
all that anyway there's dozens of

419
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,160
changes were made uh because of those

420
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,620
two comment blocks um and the remaining

421
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,080
issues from from those are now in GitHub

422
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,780
and I'll present them later

423
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,299
um but uh you know happy to you know if

424
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,580
you want to honest and Michael please if

425
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,640
you want to cross check that's fine too

426
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,260
uh next

427
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,580
well so the question is have you

428
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,620
conferred with Thomas and Michael on the

429
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,240
changes uh

430
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,059
mostly yeah yeah honest you're

431
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,460
yeah

432
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,640
okay okay

433
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,159
yeah I think there were two rounds from

434
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,940
Johannesburg so okay uh next please

435
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,960
did we lose you Ned

436
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,919
now we're got 16 here okay uh so this

437
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,840
was uh I don't think this yeah this was

438
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,179
identified in the spreadsheet um it was

439
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,020
a discussion topic uh about whether

440
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,780
you know message types this had had uh

441
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,400
to do with

442
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,460
um

443
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,039
the fact that the UCCS was uh is defined

444
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,080
outside the document so we had to put in

445
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,159
a cddl socket so that the the top level

446
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,380
message types of cwt JWT UCCS are uh in

447
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,659
in the cddl definition are a socket so

448
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,080
you can plug other message types in

449
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,440
um there was concern that was to open

450
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,380
um the resolution in the document was

451
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,159
that new uh eat message types must be

452
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,260
ietf standards

453
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,539
and we believe that closed the issue out

454
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,379
on the mailing list

455
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,559
you get on the mic

456
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,559
Thomas Versace I raised this issue and

457
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,780
it was closed

458
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,120
I'm sorry I haven't updated you I'm

459
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,559
saying okay that's all right but it was

460
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,780
thumbs up since the first change we

461
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,760
didn't show that we did okay so you're

462
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,140
okay with the changes is what you're

463
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,380
doing absolutely yes thanks thank you

464
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,460
all right next please

465
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,780
uh another one uh about security level

466
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,039
uh

467
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,320
again the claim was removed so

468
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,100
um no issue here

469
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,840
and uh next slide

470
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,940
uh this was issue number 18 in the

471
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,419
spreadsheet uh this referenced some

472
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,299
messages on the mailing list I think

473
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,220
I think Hank was involved in the

474
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,539
discussion

475
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,000
um on this uh we sought clarification

476
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,640
for what the issue was and and there was

477
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,340
never never became clear what what the

478
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,140
issue is so at this point

479
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,820
oh we can't do anything until uh some uh

480
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,559
you know there's some clarification of

481
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,320
what the issue actually is

482
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,960
have you reached out to Eric

483
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,580

I'm just looking at the was it Row 18

485

I'm just looking to see who the

486

so uh this is uh a uh a GitHub issue

508
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,080
basically the the the issue requested

509
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,340
improved text for nonce and freshness

510
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,260
um so they're uh there were changes

511
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,260
mated made uh

512
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,460
in draft 14 and I believe in 17 also

513
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,520
um no I think 14. um

514
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,760
uh so uh because uh freshness and

515
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,100
nonsense are a topic everybody cares uh

516
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,299
dearly about

517
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,460
um and we really want to make sure we we

518
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,039
get this Clean and Clear

519
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:24,299
um we have been leaving the issue open

520
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,919
um

521
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,380
and asking for comments on that and if

522
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,840
you want to review what it says about

523
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,960
freshness is freshness and nonce uh just

524
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,940
search for freshness and knots in the

525
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,559
document it's probably easier than

526
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,020
trying to look at diffs just look at

527
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,140
what the text is there and and uh

528
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,179
make your comment so this is really more

529
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,360
of a a request for comments at this

530
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,539
point

531
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,880
does anybody want to make a comment

532
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,559
about freshness or not

533
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,779
Hank is moving Hank are you getting on

534
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,200
the queue

535
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,900
thank you hey this is Hank I'm actually

536
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,520
moving because I found the other thing

537
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,440
now I'm looking at freshness requests

538
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,620
okay we'll take your comment either way

539
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,840
whichever I would ever have to come I

540
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,640
have to come back to this one so I'm

541
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,500
answering the other ones so I'm sick

542
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,779
Venture here okay you're coming back to

543
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:29,400
this project yeah number 18. yep

544
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,480
um

545
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,400
you are using the word attestations

546
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,320
which is not indistinguishable between a

547
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,539
message on an action never do this ever

548
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,039
in the document

549
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,400
so also I assume that uh

550
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,720
some of the claims are actually

551
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,880
endorsements

552
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,279
and and then and then calling them all

553
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,200
again attestations is like hyperly

554
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,419
confusing to me so that is was my

555
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,880
initial problem with it

556
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,480
um going for a unified endorsement at a

557
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,980
station design

558
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,039
so is endorsement an action or a message

559
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:05,640
is attestation a message or an activity

560
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,500
and what does the design here makes

561
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,240
absolutely no sense to the reader for me

562
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,460
I'm as the reader here at back at that

563
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,419
day

564
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,220
I have not

565
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,279
checked to be honest the current ID

566
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,360
quality if it even is well in colloquial

567
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,940
language distinguishable what

568
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,860
attestation even means

569
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,659
and so um

570
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,480
my assumption is that it is often

571
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,380
confused between an action and a message

572
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,140
and and and I think that is not helpful

573
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,820
when you

574
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,000
um talking about a message format

575
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,760
and as we assume that you always mean a

576
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,000
message but from text sometimes

577
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,539
um it feels like a like activity to me

578
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,820
and I can never really tell

579
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,820
and that that is I think my the the the

580
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,100
the the the

581
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,779
comment of number 18 was my question

582
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,539
what are attestations

583
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,779
and and that is I think the core of the

584
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,200
this the simple question I I just asked

585
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,980
there

586
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,179
you mean in Context to the draft yeah

587
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:17,460
exactly so it should be very clear that

588
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,279
an attestation only in the scope of this

589
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,899
document means

590
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,700
uh messages

591
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,980
that are originating

592
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,779
from my testers

593
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,460
and if they're originating from other

594
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,620
rows must be very clear

595
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,500
which role from the Reds architecture is

596
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,779
emitting that message and that it has

597
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,940
nothing to do with an activity I think

598
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,220
that is something very fundamental here

599
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,080
and that is what was very confusing in

600
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,240
the email coming from you Lawrence on

601
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,179
the uh Junes the 6th which I was

602
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,320
reacting to

603
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,179
and that's why that's why I made this

604
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:55,740
comment on the role 18 apparently

605
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,960
okay so let's let's break some things

606
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,799
down here to try to clarify so

607
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,899
endorsement I mean and and sticking to

608
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,299
the what's in the draft so when it the

609
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,520
the eight draft doesn't Define anything

610
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,840
to do with anything to do with

611
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,820
endorsements it mentions them a couple

612
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,860
of times yeah

613
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,000
um and only uh using the definition that

614
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,399
is in rat's architecture okay that

615
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,220
that's a message okay so it doesn't you

616
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,740
know it just I think the endorsement is

617
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,320
mentioned in the appendix maybe that's

618
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,360
it I I mean you could search it but I

619
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,460
don't we we definitely try to sidestep

620
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,020
anything to do with endorsements and

621
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,720
only say but we have to because so this

622
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,720
is not endorsements would it help if you

623
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,520
just put an asterisk or say the

624
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,080
endorsements as defined in the

625
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,020
architecture draft uh it's very it's I

626
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,179
mean no I think that's already clear

627
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,100
because that's clear there is a

628
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,480
terminology section that defines

629
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,340
endorsement and it is a copy of what's

630
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,799
in the architecture draft right so I

631
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:56,700
think

632
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,480
that's pretty clear now your thing about

633
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,679
attestation as an activity or something

634
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,720
else um now you're talking in reference

635
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,580
to an email I sent which is not the

636
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,840
draft exactly yeah okay so harness you

637
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,260
have to get on the Miracle queue

638
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,299
sorry

639
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:18,059
Dave beat you to it

640
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,159
so um

641
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,059
I mean we can't

642
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,399
Dave Taylor my question is actually for

643
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,179
Hank

644
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,080
um I did a search for the word

645
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,960
attestations with an s in the document

646
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,240
it occurs exactly once in the each spec

647
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,740
right now and it's not in the context of

648
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,419
endorsements so I'm going to read it to

649
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:37,559
you and the question is do you have a

650
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,059
problem with this text and if so can you

651
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,980
come back to the mic so this is in the

652
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,779
intended use claim

653
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,120
and uh it says certificate issuance

654
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,980
certificate authorities or Cas may

655
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,559
require attestations prior to the

656
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,240
issuances of certificates related to key

657
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,220
Paris hosted at the entity yeah do you

658
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,840
need that word change and if so raise

659
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,460
your comment in context of that sentence

660
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,659
because this is not about it it's not

661
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,279
not about not about endorsement so it's

662
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,840
probably not row 18. it's

663
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,460
thank you Dave that's an excellent

664
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,480
example

665
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,240
this is probably means attestation

666
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,659
evidence

667
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,179
or education results of the whole

668
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,000
procedure I see okay okay or both or

669
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,080
yeah

670
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,940
yeah okay then there's only remnants

671
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,340
back in the days it was way more

672
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,679
vague but if that's the last remarant of

673
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,899
that that is easier to remediate it okay

674
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,899
uh yeah let's uh sure we can we can fix

675
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:30,059
that so Carl are you coming up to speak

676
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,960
as a co-author

677
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,580
so you are allowed to come back and

678
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,418
respond you don't need to get no

679
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,860
um

680
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,459
yeah

681
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,620
um verification um I wanted to come back

682
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,720
oh it's basic question on the earlier

683
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,760
issue about the nonsense and the

684
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,559
freshness aspects

685
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,120
um I proposed some text and I was

686
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,620
wondering whether you took that text or

687
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,120
you proposed somebody so whether I

688
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,460
should review it uh well uh maybe it was

689
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,779
long ago

690
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,500
yeah I can't remember okay uh what what

691
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,679
uh text you proposed or and what we used

692
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,320
um but I I'd say uh I'm a double check

693
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,179
do you know search for knots and search

694
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,860
for freshness yeah I don't think it's

695
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,720
more than 10 sentences altogether Okay

696
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,820
so

697
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,320
and then you'll see the whole you get

698
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,600
the big picture and and know if it's if

699
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,519
we're we hit it or not the endorsement

700
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,919
thing was largely killed before I I got

701
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,840
to the mic but just to make sure it

702
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,140
stays dead as I was reading the the mail

703
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,779
chain I think this is all based in the

704
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,120
security level stuff which is already

705
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,240
gone because it's gone right so I think

706
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,760
most of the endorsement stuff okay that

707
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,980
emanated from that thread was was rooted

708
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,860
in security level which is no more

709
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,440
okay well the question is the text

710
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,240
should have been removed then

711
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,519
so no longer available right

712
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,740
I think the the email thread was in in

713
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,540
the context of security level right

714
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,359
right well that's what it yeah

715
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,500
yeah there's nothing left in the

716
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,520
document

717
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,918
so this issue 18 is basically turned

718
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:18,179
into

719
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,679
uh

720
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,320
any issue about the intended use claim

721
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,960
and the its use of the word uh

722
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,239
attestations

723
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,839
so okay uh next I think we're jumping

724
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,300
ahead to now because we

725
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,379
got the freshness thing yeah

726
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:41,520
okay secure boot uh so this was a an

727
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,980
issue filed by Honest

728
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,480
um the current text requires uh

729
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,239
the secure boot the definition of a

730
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:54,960
secure claim requires that the booted

731
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,440
software be under the control of the OEM

732
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,900
the proposed text which this says

733
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,880
doesn't relax as that and doesn't

734
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,560
require the Buddhist software to be

735
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,540
under control of anybody in particular

736
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,560
it just requires the use of secure boot

737
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,180
um you know us authors prefer the

738
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,800
current text

739
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,839
um I'll also point out that this this

740
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,839
definition of the security claim has

741
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,359
been in the in the document since uh

742
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,140
draft five uh December 2020 and it was

743
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,579
also the text approved for

744
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,859
pre-allocation

745
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:33,500
so let's take comments on that

746
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,460
Dave's getting on the queue

747
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,240
you're in the queue

748
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,040
then my apologies to harness

749
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,540
I'm trying to press buttons too fast

750
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,660
um

751
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,160
I don't know what the proposed text was

752
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,660
unless it's like I don't think it's on

753
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,280
the screen right now

754
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,599
um although

755
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,040
um I think there is a valid argument

756
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,119
here

757
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,880
that uh some secure boot is not

758
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,760
necessarily the OEM

759
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,160
um if you think of a case where say an

760
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,380
Enterprise buys a device and the

761
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,579
Enterprise wants to be the one that

762
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,680
actually controls the secure boot

763
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,420
process rather than the OEM I think

764
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,640
that's a valid scenario

765
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,020
um and so I think I probably would like

766
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,220
but I can't say whether I like the

767
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,480
proposed X better without it being on

768
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,099
the screen yeah but I would say that I

769
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,540
think that the current text May in fact

770
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,160
after thinking about I think the current

771
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,260
text may be too narrow

772
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,540
right so so my response to that is it

773
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,619
doesn't

774
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,960
it just means you can't use this claim

775
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,760
it doesn't mean you can't use secure

776
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,619
boot

777
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:47,339
um

778
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,960
it just so you're saying we should

779
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,400
Define another claim that's a superset

780
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,200
of this one and then oems will be

781
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,720
confused as to which one to use well the

782
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,760
other the the other question I have is

783
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,380
so

784
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,420
because then you could call this one OEM

785
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,160
secure boot or something like that and

786
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,380
then yeah yeah if you consider yourself

787
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,640
an oem use this one if you don't

788
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,960
consider yourself an oem use the other

789
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,700
use another one that might be definable

790
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,079
yeah I think I mean actually in the

791
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,700
discussion in GitHub I propose that

792
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,160
maybe this should be renamed to OEM

793
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,020
authorized boot or something like that

794
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,380
yeah so so I'd say yes that would be

795
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,359
acceptable so I'd say either okay rename

796
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,160
it or expand it without the rename but

797
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,599
don't leave the generic name with them

798
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,300
yeah and the other thing is I don't know

799
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,579
what to do

800
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,960
what meaning how to define the meaning

801
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,720
of just a secure boot unless it's you

802
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,220
say who controls that I just don't know

803
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,720
what that that what that what that would

804
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,700
look like right so and I'm a huge fan of

805
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,780
the approach it says if you don't have

806
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,880
consensus on it like yesterday then

807
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,380
leave it to an extension document open

808
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,060
the base one and so I think it's

809
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,220
perfectly fine for you to respond saying

810
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,839
we're not going to put the more generic

811
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,220
one in this document that's going to be

812
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,200
in an extension that can add that I love

813
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,460
that style of answer we did the same

814
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,460
thing in suits so I I I I like that

815
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,200
approach and so I think the rename is

816
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,420
probably the simplest uh least effort

817
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,460
thank you

818
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,000
honest yeah so what the document says is

819
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,040
secure boot is considered enabled when

820
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,020
the firmware and operating system are

821
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,880
under the control of the manufacturer of

822
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,400
the entity identified in the OEM ID

823
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,960
claim okay

824
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,820
and um

825
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,320
like

826
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,560
for me secure boot is a it's a kind of a

827
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,619
more technical term

828
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,660
where you

829
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,260
almost always you start the sun

830
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,200
non-mutable immutable code which is like

831
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,420
some run code in ROM

832
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,220
and then you

833
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,440
and also have some keys there and then

834
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,480
you verify the next stage and then that

835
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,060
verifies then the next stage uh so this

836
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,060
whole notion of um

837
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:51,000
controlling something is is I think

838
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,099
I I didn't quite understood what that

839
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,260
practically means like when do I then

840
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,540
claim that I'm using secure put versus

841
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,460
not because even with mesh output you

842
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,980
could you could argue that you are

843
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,140
controlling the other things uh

844
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,619
May well be uh but it's not secure put

845
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,260
right like under what condition can I

846
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,859
can I uh say that I'm really controlling

847
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,500
the other software the the the different

848
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,900
layers of uh software that comes

849
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,700
firmware and and maybe there might be

850
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,859
bootloaders uh as it is used in practice

851
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,000
and then

852
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,520
like that's what I that's what my

853
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,460
question was to in that that regard

854
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,579
so let me respond to that uh a bit um so

855
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,859
you know if you think of something as

856
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:41,060
complex as a mobile phone uh

857
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,220
with an app download system and you can

858
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,040
you know run JavaScript in the browser

859
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,260
and all that so you can't say controls

860
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,140
all the software stack from from right

861
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,359
so the so the words chosen I think are

862
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,220
firmware and operating system

863
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,040
and uh

864
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,859
the the the choice was also to use the

865
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,200
word control here because

866
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,560
um and not not be specific to something

867
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,500
that use uses a specific mechanism

868
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,119
because there's a lot of ways the OEM

869
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,760
can control it right the the the the

870
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,220
device could be running solely out of

871
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,180
ROM

872
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,200
so no crypto required the the code is

873
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,240
solely out of ROM there's no there's no

874
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,980
software that's updated or uploaded or

875
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,420
anything like that that isn't a valid

876
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,400
means of control I mean you could even

877
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,740
put the put the device in a you know

878
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,900
titanium Cube or something like that so

879
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,720
that there's no no way for them to

880
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,540
change it uh so that try to tried to

881
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,240
avoid that definition of like public key

882
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,940
signing and or Max or anything like that

883
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,800
quite intentionally

884
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,099
um so so uh

885
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:54,240
that's why you know the OEM control uh

886
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,579
under under OEM control

887
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,020
um this is what we did in Fido

888
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,220
certification

889
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,839
is really the definition and

890
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:02,339
phytocertification is the phyto

891
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:04,020
authenticator needs to be under under

892
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,540
control of the the manufacturer of the

893
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,240
Fido authenticator so my my question on

894
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,180
us is if we change it to OEM authorized

895
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,800
boot or something like that does that

896
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,660
address your question your your concern

897
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,540
okay

898
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,560
Brenda Brendan at the mic uh so for me

899
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,560
secure boot means that you have

900
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,359
something immutable

901
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,940
and that's all it means

902
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,560
and what you do with that something

903
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,140
immutable is up to you

904
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,300
um for the conventional meanings of

905
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,920
secure boot the ones that I would go

906
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,119
with

907
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,920
um that would mean that there is a

908
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,079
public key that has verified something

909
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,579
or or a Mac if you prefer and indeed the

910
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:54,060
key identifier defines the identity of

911
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,980
whoever controls the device

912
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,800
so talking about it being the OEM well

913
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,040
if the oem's public key happens to match

914
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,980
the key identifier that authenticated

915
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,619
your boot code then the OEM controls it

916
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,960
otherwise they don't I don't see why we

917
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,940
need to make a distinction you have a

918
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,500
cluster of keys

919
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,200
that's who controls the device the

920
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,240
reason there's a distinction there is

921
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,480
that the OEM can do it without

922
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,859
assert that control without a collection

923
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,839
of keys you're talking about the screw

924
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:27,000
in the uh in the bottom of the laptop

925
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,380
that you take out if you want to install

926
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,020
Linux yes I understand this no actually

927
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,160
no

928
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,020
I'm just saying I could build a tiny

929
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,880
little iot device that just runs out of

930
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,720
ROM

931
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,300
so that's the immutability that I was

932
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,740
talking about earlier

933
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,720
yeah but there's no key ID or any key

934
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,280
identifier though because it's immutable

935
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,140
it's not under control of anyone it's

936
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,140
immutable it can't change

937
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,640
but the OEM controls it when they made

938
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,780
the device

939
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,460
that that seems like a very odd

940
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,720
distinction to me that that's all I'll

941
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,140
say Okay I I guess the question is then

942
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,760
are you

943
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,760
okay with the changing in the the

944
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,460
definition to OEM authorized boot

945
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,480
yeah it I mean it means it means it

946
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,300
means a lot in the Fido context I mean

947
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,520
you know Fido is is a clear example of

948
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,300
where this works

949
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,079
and lots of other people have agreed

950
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,940
with it and understand it and all

951
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:32,040
Hank you're in the queue

952
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,440
yeah I'm again doing the time Trevor

953
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,700
thing

954
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,280
um coming back to the issue with the

955
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,099
freshness and the uh and the nuns things

956
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:43,819
I uh

957
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,619
so before we move then if there are no

958
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,780
other comments it's the question of how

959
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,660
oh I'm sorry you're continues so I have

960
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,980
a comment on this

961
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,400
um the immutable the

962
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,740
secure boot means evidence until boot

963
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,720
Integrity has been established and that

964
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,339
has been in set in stone as evidence

965
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,140
until the next boot

966
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,599
has that been defined flavor is nothing

967
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,300
has that been defined anywhere I don't

968
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,740
remember it being in the architecture

969
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,819
spec either

970
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,700
okay secure boot is definitely a

971
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,060
ambiguous word in in general right I

972
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,920
would not think that you can't look up

973
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,900
secure boot in Wikipedia I didn't get it

974
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,180
or TCG documents or something like that

975
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,619
and get a definition everybody will

976
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,839
agree on that's why the wording in in

977
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,759
eight is under control of the OEM

978
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,020
it's not making a beta it's not making

979
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,300
it worse okay

980
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,300
okay

981
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,640
I will I will note that as you guys are

982
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,040
not going to block moving forward

983
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,040
based on this wording yeah so the rename

984
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,260
yeah Dave really wants to rename I agree

985
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,000
with the rename I think that's good so

986
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,460
now not now do you have enough to prove

987
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,619
your next comment is fresh

988
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:58,220
yes

989
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,940
and I don't need an answer and that's

990
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,140
the point

991
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,760
um that's exactly the point I don't need

992
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,260
a nons to be fresh

993
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,940
and that is

994
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,980
very now you're moving back to the

995
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,780
previous comment on freshness exactly

996
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,980
again again okay sorry yeah I'm slow I

997
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,380
have a latest job it is refreshed you

998
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,359
know uh

999
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:21,599
uh auditable after the fact

1000
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,660
um

1001
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,260
you couple in 8.4 replay protection

1002
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,640
privacy

1003
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,040
and say that it defines the nons claim

1004
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,640
for total replay protection yes

1005
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,160
and then in parenthesis also sometimes

1006
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,960
known as token freshness

1007
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,460
huh I would

1008
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,420
um disagree with that entirely

1009
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:52,020
only because that use of nuns is by by

1010
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,660
circumstance a way to established

1011
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,000
freshness the ad hoc freshness because

1012
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,940
you as the issue of the nuns know that

1013
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,800
you just issued it

1014
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,680
is making you the only viable source of

1015
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,180
freshness by receiving something

1016
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,520
including your non so that that's all

1017
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,260
the nuns is about our freshness but

1018
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,180
that's not the problem I think that the

1019
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,099
the the the the coupling of Replay

1020
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:18,180
attacks and freshness is the problem

1021
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,000
because in 9.3 freshness

1022
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,119
you say all eat must use must provide a

1023
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,660
freshness mechanism to prevent replay

1024
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,940
attacks and that is nonsense

1025
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,800
um you don't need freshness

1026
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,720
to protection from

1027
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,180
replay attacks who need freshness for

1028
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,920
proofs of freshness

1029
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,900
and that's all and that the nuns by

1030
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,180
accident does both as a lucky

1031
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,460
coincidence that is not relevant to the

1032
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,740
concept okay and I think that has to be

1033
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,740
really kept apart and and that that's

1034
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,960
why I'm a little bit confused by that

1035
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,160
all the time because people always

1036
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,460
confuse nons as a freshness mechanism

1037
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,520
it is actually but I would say that

1038
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,319
there's a lack of coincidence to have it

1039
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,020
both in one thing okay and and just just

1040
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,180
decouple that okay so that and that's

1041
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,920
that's security considerations I think

1042
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,200
right uh

1043
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,599
it's surprisingly it's in privacy

1044
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,940
considerations okay okay yeah so we get

1045
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,680
those those are in the notes so we'll

1046
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,260
okay we can um

1047
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,300
improve the text that is the last

1048
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,460
remaining part where it's still couples

1049
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,200
and you decoupled it at other places I

1050
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,700
know that you already did it at some

1051
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,619
places but just I think also not in fact

1052
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,359
okay yeah

1053
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:34,040
okay Rakesh you're in the queue

1054
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,160
yeah that was a fresh comment thank you

1055
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,819
yeah

1056
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,940
just one comment on the secular part so

1057
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,220
would it help to rather call it a scope

1058
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,960
of the keyboard because

1059
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,359
from vendor to vendor uh the definition

1060
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:56,640
of uh the stage of circuit board varies

1061
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,619
like UV compliance acute boot is

1062
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:00,060
different from let's say what some other

1063
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,220
vendors do would it help to Define like

1064
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,079
what's the scope of the keyboard in here

1065
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,940
or the type or what you're referring to

1066
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,339
for me would that help

1067
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:11,700
uh yeah I think we're just trying to

1068
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,200
I I didn't I couldn't quite hear

1069
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,720
everything you said there but

1070
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,819
you're saying if you put a definition

1071
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:20,280
like can we have like as what's the

1072
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,380
scope of secure boot in the context of

1073
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,140
attestation like do we look at ufe

1074
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,640
compliance in cuboid as what we would

1075
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,960
want to pick up where you start from the

1076
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,119
bootloader or some vendors have it like

1077
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:31,920
from Hardware Route across basic reboot

1078
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,460
versus CPU basically boot so do we have

1079
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,900
something like a scope or circuit would

1080
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,000
defined and would that help clarify this

1081
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,520
so I'm yeah so the the definition

1082
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,300
currently says the firmware in the OS

1083
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,079
um

1084
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,900
uh and you're maybe trying to say we

1085
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,900
should lock that down more

1086
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,700
um

1087
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,200
when we say firmware again it's kind of

1088
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,119
it becomes a bit hazy because again uh

1089
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,220
you could split into multiple stages

1090
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,720
before you actually get to the North the

1091
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,079
network operating system so

1092
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,420
till what stage do we expect the OEM to

1093
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,460
control it versus what could I like

1094
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,900
let's I'll give an example of let's say

1095
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,300
someone wants to run like Sonic on a box

1096
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,560
that's

1097
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,240
sold by a vendor

1098
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,339
what would be the scope of the keyboard

1099
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:19,079
in that context

1100
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,359
right so that there's there's I mean

1101
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,819
there's a tricky one because yeah like I

1102
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:26,460
said there's we're dealing with uh you

1103
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,200
know a device that could be as simple as

1104
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,060
just a ROM

1105
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,160
like and no operating system at all

1106
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,500
right yeah

1107
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,319
to uh a mobile phone which has got

1108
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:41,339
100 CPUs the boot I mean at least 50. I

1109
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:43,680
mean and they all have boot chains and

1110
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,180
and then they have downloadable software

1111
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,540
and right so so

1112
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,819
I don't really you know if we if we

1113
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:53,280
tried to Define system architectures and

1114
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,380
a taxonomy system architectures and all

1115
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,520
of that we're going to get into trouble

1116
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,660
so

1117
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,780
we'll be here you know for pages and

1118
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,060
Pages we're lingering on this one right

1119
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,000
so definition for too long Dave you're

1120
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,619
in the queue

1121
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:10,740
remind me what was the renamed version

1122
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,200
the what what was the rename it went to

1123
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,099
OEM OEM authorized boot authorized boot

1124
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,780
um there's three instances of the word

1125
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,579
secure boot one is in the title and do

1126
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:22,680
is in the sentences whatever as long as

1127
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,060
you rename all three of them then people

1128
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,319
stop asking you any questions about what

1129
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,619
secure boot means okay oh yes oh that's

1130
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:31,680
good thank you okay and then I asked for

1131
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,380
a point of order no takers where are you

1132
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,280
guys taking notes

1133
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:41,099
okay I'm not seeing it so as long as

1134
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:43,260
you're capturing the discussion and the

1135
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,720
agreements that's what's important

1136
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,220
so I just want to make sure that those

1137
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,420
are getting captured because I'm not

1138
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,160
seeing it on my headstock yeah

1139
00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:56,460
okay so um I I have given you the whole

1140
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,800
open make time so I'm going to give you

1141
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,960
nine minutes left and then that will

1142
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,540
heat up the whole slot just FYI all

1143
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,520
right next slide please

1144
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,740
you have six left okay yeah

1145
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,040
good morning

1146
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,579
okay so this is PR number 296. this

1147
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:17,640
relates to that section 9.2 about claims

1148
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,200
characteristics that I mentioned

1149
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,200
previously uh the my understanding of

1150
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,040
this of this issue is that um it's a

1151
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,099
suggestion for separate ex expert review

1152
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:33,119
for eat claims so we would somehow have

1153
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,660
to distinguish eat claims from other JWT

1154
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,760
and cwt claims

1155
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,800
uh

1156
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,260
um because the these claims would be eat

1157
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,180
claims would be subject to more extra

1158
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,640
more review or different criteria or

1159
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,740
something like that

1160
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,900
um uh you know I I don't think this is a

1161
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,480
question that we want to separate the

1162
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,099
Registries or create a whole new eat

1163
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,140
registry it seems like it does beg the

1164
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,940
question of some sort of a bit in the

1165
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,800
registry that tells you whether this is

1166
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,319
uh an eat claim or not

1167
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,880
um

1168
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,839
the uh eat authors think that the

1169
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,200
current expert review is fine and um

1170
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,000
that the expert review that's applied to

1171
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,819
cwt and GWT is sufficient

1172
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:20,160
um and that trying to create a separate

1173
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,119
expert review would cause uh

1174
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,700
would be kind of a big step to take so

1175
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,359
so anybody that wants separate expert

1176
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:38,460
review for

1177
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,420
eat claims

1178
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,260
okay not hearing any

1179
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,660
let's move on

1180
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,680
thank you

1181
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,740
okay Cabo is getting in the queue

1182
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:03,619
Carson's already in the queue anyway

1183
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,020
customer I don't have a problem with uh

1184
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,059
using the same expert

1185
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:18,000
here but the question

1186
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,400
really is where does the information get

1187
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,020
recorded whether the expert used the JWT

1188
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,400
yardstick

1189
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,220
or the idiotic

1190
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,859
I think that needs to be somewhere after

1191
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:35,420
the review is done

1192
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,960
um but there is not a separate eight

1193
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,819
yardstick is there

1194
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,880
I don't think so well I think it's

1195
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,280
whether we need to

1196
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,319
cook a question at hand I mean an expert

1197
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:51,240
will look at the thing to think what are

1198
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,640
you trying to use this for then the

1199
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,380
registrant would say I will use it for

1200
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,480
each and then an expert review will

1201
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,000
happen and then the information is lost

1202
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,700
so people who consult the registry will

1203
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,079
not be able to find out whether the

1204
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,940
review considered this or not

1205
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,900
that's a mistake

1206
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:14,700
sank and we were talking about like for

1207
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,000
years about adding a uh

1208
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,300
column to the uh to the Eid registry

1209
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,819
that says this is about eating uh sorry

1210
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:27,000
sorry cwt registry that this is about

1211
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,059
eat we could flag that yeah I I was

1212
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,099
going to ask because I'm I'm ignorant so

1213
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:34,079
the expert reviewed today

1214
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,500
right on the dots and see watch are they

1215
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,099
documented under the Ina registry

1216
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:43,880
would they

1217
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,540
I just wanted to to add that we just had

1218
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,040
the same discussion in the previous

1219
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,160
voting group meeting I was in so we need

1220
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,220
to understand that there are Registries

1221
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,480
that we are using from other

1222
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,099
specifications

1223
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,079
that are almost right

1224
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,020
we just need to add a column to that and

1225
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,819
that should be in that operation right

1226
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:07,680
so the question is do we need to put

1227
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,200
that request in the other working group

1228
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,439
foreign

1229
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,400
column I think we raised

1230
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,920
three years ago and it kind of never

1231
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,220
really stuck and we're reiterating it

1232
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,559
like on a yearly basis and I think this

1233
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:34,680
is uh this year

1234
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,300
okay

1235
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,619
Michael you're not in the but but I'm

1236
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:42,599
Gonna Let You Go just because he's an

1237
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:45,240
expert interest of time and he is one of

1238
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,000
the expert reviewers Michael Jones a

1239
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,280
designated expert for said

1240
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,839
registry

1241
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,240
um

1242
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:58,879
what what is the purpose of the column

1243
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,940
so the purpose of the touch screen is

1244
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,859
that cwts

1245
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:14,880
should be protected from using uh

1246
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,859
certain semantics

1247
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:19,980
by accident because every cwt claim

1248
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,319
automatically is allowed for every cwt

1249
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,640
apparently

1250
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:29,160
so some are very red specific and

1251
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,700
and someone who just reads a claim name

1252
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,720
might be uh inclined to read what they

1253
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,040
want to read

1254
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,260
but not what it actually means and that

1255
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,720
does not actually eat uh read to eat

1256
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,660
ideas RFC at that point so I would give

1257
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,119
that as a pointer

1258
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:49,859
through the semantics this is about

1259
00:56:49,859 --> 00:56:51,599
remote attestation

1260
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,240
and and if by accident

1261
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,240
this can also be used for cider

1262
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,099
production that's great

1263
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:02,099
but you should be very aware of that I

1264
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:05,880
think it's relatively dangerous to uh to

1265
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,000
uh to go for some UE ID for example

1266
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,680
which is useful

1267
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,319
in most contexts but I think you really

1268
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:15,599
have to be understand that this is for

1269
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,720
device identification in the context of

1270
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,599
remote attestation so if this doesn't

1271
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:22,980
work for you

1272
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,579
in your scenario that's highly vital to

1273
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:29,160
a no and so that is just just as an

1274
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,220
indicator that there's a specific set of

1275
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,619
semantics here that is a subset of

1276
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,240
everything that cwt was initially

1277
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,380
intended for

1278
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,079
it's not just the web tone right

1279
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,359
so Michael yearnicky were you in a pylon

1280
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,700
Michael Richardson sorry oh can I

1281
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,859
respond yes go ahead

1282
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:48,960
um Hank I don't see those

1283
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,680
characteristics as unique to eat

1284
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,760
um

1285
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,040
I don't see those characteristics as you

1286
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,540
need to eat

1287
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,079
uh for instance Ace registered cwt

1288
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:03,780
claims some of them are general purpose

1289
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,140
some of them are very specific uh the

1290
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:09,059
same could be said of the Jose

1291
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,780
algorithms registry and or the Jose

1292
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,960
claims registries

1293
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,880
the way you find out as an implementer

1294
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,819
that something is highly eat specific

1295
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:23,040
is you read the reference in the

1296
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,559
registry pointing to the definition of

1297
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:26,760
the claim

1298
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,640
and you decide whether that's applicable

1299
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,339
or not I don't think it makes sense to

1300
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:34,200
special case eat because the

1301
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,660
characteristic you're talking about is

1302
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,099
true of all other

1303
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:42,980
third party claims registrations as well

1304
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,140
Michael you might not want to go away

1305
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,520
uh hi

1306
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,640
um is it okay if I call you all Michael

1307
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,780
okay just make sure yeah

1308
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,540
yes that's fine um so um

1309
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,400
the first point on this slide was never

1310
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,280
the point of the of the pr

1311
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,859
okay the first point the point of the pr

1312
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:13,980
the issue was that

1313
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:18,420
um we might want to write a few uh a

1314
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,819
qualifying words for the expert

1315
00:59:20,819 --> 00:59:23,280
reviewers that

1316
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,760
um renders the uh so that eat claims

1317
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,420
actually are a subset of what

1318
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,420
um cwts could make and so the question

1319
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,520
is I don't know exactly what those those

1320
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,920
words might be and that that was the

1321
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,720
point of the disc was to have a

1322
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,520
discussion that

1323
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,220
um can you do anything can you is it is

1324
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,020
the whole list of anything that you

1325
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,079
could do as an eat claim sorry as a cwt

1326
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:51,900
cream a caught claim does that all apply

1327
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,720
to eat or are there some subsets and

1328
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,059
there's other some other things as well

1329
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:59,880
I think we just had a conversation about

1330
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,200
the OEM secure boot claim right and mass

1331
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,480
confusion and it sounded to me actually

1332
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,980
that

1333
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,319
we might need three or four different

1334
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,880
claims

1335
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,440
right for that

1336
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,240
and when those claims when those

1337
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,059
requests came to the expert reviewers

1338
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:20,880
then one of the things I I think it

1339
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,799
would be reasonable to say to the expert

1340
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,200
reviewers is it is reasonable that you

1341
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,240
have three or four claims that appear

1342
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,799
the same but come from different

1343
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,900
communities because they have different

1344
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,339
semantics

1345
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:35,040
that would be nonsense in a caught

1346
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,020
generic cost space that would be stupid

1347
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,000
it's the whole point of of a thing but

1348
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,680
in this case it would be makes sense we

1349
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,359
might like to say that now that's

1350
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:44,760
essentially asking the uh expert

1351
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,500
reviewers

1352
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,440
um not to change how they review it but

1353
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,960
rather to actually say oh this might

1354
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,000
actually be a subset of the things there

1355
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,920
are certain criteria that

1356
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,859
um you need to apply more strenuously or

1357
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:00,839
a little bit less generously and that's

1358
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:03,480
where it all came down to okay so I

1359
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,220
asked the question to you Mike is is

1360
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,319
right now do you think you could deal

1361
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:09,180
with that we had the conversation OEM

1362
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:10,619
claim versus the other thing do you

1363
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:12,599
think you could sort that out

1364
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:16,220
or do you need extra guidance

1365
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,140
if I would need guidance I would

1366
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,280
probably

1367
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,819
have a conversation on the thread

1368
01:01:22,819 --> 01:01:25,980
requesting the registration with the

1369
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,079
registrants there is a mailing list

1370
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:31,460
exactly for that purpose

1371
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:35,940
okay so I'm going to cut the cue at Dave

1372
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,059
because we are now way over

1373
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:41,160
but go ahead and this will be the last

1374
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,799
slide for this uh Roman do you need to

1375
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:45,000
do so to close that thread and borrow

1376
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,859
Hank's time machine about how do we

1377
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:48,119
document the decision in the

1378
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:49,799
conversation it's exactly that we have

1379
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:53,160
the cwt registration registrants

1380
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,839
whatever that mailing list is where we

1381
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:56,640
documented the conversation about both

1382
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,559
of the early allocation kind of requests

1383
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,299
for this document so if we need a place

1384
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,859
it already exists now it's a public

1385
01:02:01,859 --> 01:02:04,279
archive

1386
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,559
I was just going to say that this is

1387
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:09,119
actually related to the conversation

1388
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,400
that was closed right which is I agree

1389
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,619
that's closed that to eat by itself as a

1390
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:15,540
framework right eat is not something

1391
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,980
that you can interoperate with right you

1392
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,559
interoperate with any profile okay and

1393
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:22,619
so by saying that we should not say the

1394
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:24,599
following claims are not eat claims that

1395
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:26,760
sentence makes no sense and he profile

1396
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,260
gets to decide what's a claim in that

1397
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,520
heat profile and if it wants to pick

1398
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,720
some claim out of the other ones and

1399
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,920
it's up to the job of the first rounding

1400
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,180
profile to explain how that makes sense

1401
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,859
if they need a new claim that they can

1402
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:36,359
document that and the expert reviewers

1403
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:38,280
can the designator of yours can decide

1404
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,319
whether it duplicates an existing one or

1405
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,760
not right I don't think we need another

1406
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,740
column so use plus one to Mike but I

1407
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,260
think it's because we made the the uh

1408
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,380
the framework resolution which I liked

1409
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,579
um I think that actually answers this

1410
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:51,839
question too is my opinion so thanks

1411
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:55,079
Steve so so the uh the last comment I

1412
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:57,780
have on this is that um if we if we take

1413
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,760
this on and and

1414
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,700
try to figure out how to add an extra

1415
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,059
column and have context sensitive

1416
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:07,799
Ayana Registries I mean that seems like

1417
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:09,420
a very large amount of work that's going

1418
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,359
to delay eat for months to me because I

1419
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:13,619
I mean that's

1420
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:16,140
that's uh

1421
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,420
I I mean I don't know maybe Ayanna knows

1422
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,160
how to do this already but

1423
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,740
that seems like a new thing from from

1424
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,660
Ayana point of view so that's definitely

1425
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:28,619
uh demotivating into me

1426
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:29,940
okay

1427
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,740
we did yeah

1428
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,160
okay good

1429
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,700
okay thank you

1430
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:40,680
Okay so

1431
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,660
I'm gonna have to start

1432
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,220
being really tight with the clock

1433
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,819
because we are now five minutes over

1434
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:52,260
um up next is our four seats

1435
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,680
Thomas

1436
01:04:04,819 --> 01:04:08,240
so if you can do it in 13 minutes

1437
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,220
right that's right so speak fast sorry

1438
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,419
yeah so

1439
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:16,280
um

1440
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,500
so Eric can can talk now because he's

1441
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,020
gone uh so I will take over his part

1442
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:25,020
which was uh talking about the

1443
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,500
um recently published uh R4 which is

1444
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,180
zero three is just a refresh of zero two

1445
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:34,500
and we did it not for that not to expire

1446
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,839
um and I think at this point

1447
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,839
um we think the main blocks are in place

1448
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,520
and

1449
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,420
um

1450
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,520
and that's why basically there's no

1451
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,859
further content that we had

1452
01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:47,819
um

1453
01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:49,799
but that doesn't mean that all the

1454
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:52,740
building blocks are all right

1455
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,240
um and in particular I think what the

1456
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,980
document very much needs at this point

1457
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,020
in time is people from all places

1458
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,460
verifiers

1459
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,180
um a testers and and relying parties to

1460
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,339
take a look at the internal organization

1461
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:09,180
of uh the trustworthiness vector and try

1462
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,819
to match it against their use cases

1463
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:14,040
um and that would be immensely useful

1464
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,119
for us

1465
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,059
um and the questions you answers are you

1466
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:20,220
know are the currently defined appraisal

1467
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:23,220
categories what I really want to have uh

1468
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,319
is there any Gap in what we have at the

1469
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:26,160
moment

1470
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,260
um and and what do we need right being

1471
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,359
you know

1472
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,980
up front and telling telling us I need

1473
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,660
this category and and this other

1474
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,400
category that are not there at this

1475
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,140
point in time so to make something that

1476
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,700
is really useful

1477
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,440
um for everyone

1478
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,040
we really need to factor in as wide as

1479
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,480
input as possible

1480
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,599
um and so I'm I'm asking the chairs here

1481
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:52,319
what would be a a good way to organize

1482
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:53,700
this kind of

1483
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:58,380
feedback uh cycle well so you can try

1484
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,119
and do a side meeting I don't know how

1485
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:04,440
many comments you've had on email thread

1486
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,180
none none

1487
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:10,020
so we could solicit feedback correct

1488
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,280
right

1489
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,380
um usually when I do the calls for

1490
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,900
interest I put the questions of

1491
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,720
is this draft right of Interest are you

1492
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,520
willing to implement are you willing to

1493
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,819
review contribute right yeah

1494
01:06:23,819 --> 01:06:26,339
go ahead hang okay yes so this is Hank

1495
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:28,920
from uh from uh um implementation point

1496
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,359
of view there's the uh there's this ACC

1497
01:06:32,359 --> 01:06:35,039
the confidential

1498
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,400
Computing Consortium I did the right CCC

1499
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,859
yeah exactly okay so

1500
01:06:40,859 --> 01:06:43,140
um there's a lot of discussion about

1501
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,660
this packaging of capabilities that

1502
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,280
would have been reflected in attestation

1503
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,400
results and I think uh maybe if we want

1504
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,660
to have a uh uh uh like a

1505
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,480
demonstration of Interest we could yield

1506
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,280
some of these implementers that are

1507
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,680
actually doing the stuff into this uh

1508
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,020
discussion once they don't want to

1509
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,460
standardize things they just want to

1510
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,380
implement things but maybe for in this

1511
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,160
case it might be a good to have a uh um

1512
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,440
like a like a shared

1513
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,780
um and vote of a demonstration of of

1514
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:18,780
Interest right yeah the problem I have

1515
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,640
at the moment is that I participate in

1516
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,619
that community so I'm trying to trigger

1517
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:25,500
that kind of feedback there but in fact

1518
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,039
the what I want is the community right I

1519
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,839
mean we're still even if the group

1520
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:33,240
decides to adopt I mean it's the

1521
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,240
participants

1522
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,980
the thing is there is it's a working

1523
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,680
group document so yeah it's not that the

1524
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,240
problem the problem is really what we

1525
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,059
have as the information model uh is it

1526
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:47,640
sufficient is it fitting you know right

1527
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,160
because that's our I I don't know it

1528
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,319
fits my use cases but I'm not all the

1529
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,119
use case in the world so I'd like to

1530
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,400
hear more well it may be hard to capture

1531
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,859
all the use cases so at some point you

1532
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:01,099
need to bound the problem otherwise

1533
01:08:01,099 --> 01:08:03,599
unfortunately Eric White is absent in

1534
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,760
exactness movement yeah so he would have

1535
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,500
maybe more yeah I realize that okay

1536
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,660
um Roman is in the queue too don't know

1537
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:18,839
a suggestion on how to elicit that

1538
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:20,759
feedback I mean schedule a virtual

1539
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:22,620
interim like yeah and this is what's on

1540
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,479
the agenda and if there's a lot of

1541
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:25,679
iteration kind of back and forth you

1542
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,299
know put it on the side as a design team

1543
01:08:27,299 --> 01:08:29,279
but maybe pin a date everyone brings

1544
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,479
their use cases then we figure out

1545
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,219
whether you know the the overlap with

1546
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:34,380
yours or new stuff is needed okay so do

1547
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,759
you want it to be in

1548
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,040
formal rats because my suggestion was

1549
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,560
for them to have a side meeting but do

1550
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,238
you want a formal

1551
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:43,979
oh I mean if

1552
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:45,660
if you think you can resolve it now kind

1553
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,979
of this week kind of by all means it

1554
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:48,839
just felt like maybe I've looked at this

1555
01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:49,920
enough there was a little homework

1556
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,600
people needed to do and given I hope

1557
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,979
people need to do that sounded like

1558
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:55,920
there are other people outside of

1559
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,319
the community right sure

1560
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,380
okay so Tom maybe you Eric and the

1561
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:04,319
chairs we can decide on what the next

1562
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,299
step should be thanks very much and and

1563
01:09:06,299 --> 01:09:09,140
the this this presentation here is um

1564
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:11,339
we've been we've been working on a

1565
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:14,759
civilization of our foresee uh obviously

1566
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:17,040
you know with supporting uh codes

1567
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,979
um and um this is would be just a quick

1568
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:22,799
report for uh for sharing you know with

1569
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,198
fellow attestation enthusiasts to uh you

1570
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:28,198
know what where we are and uh you know

1571
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:30,060
to stimulate discussion um

1572
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,160
but yeah so

1573
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,719
um

1574
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:36,420
the goal of our foresee just to recap is

1575
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:38,100
to Define an information model for

1576
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,080
conveying a normalized set of

1577
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,600
Association results and uh at the core

1578
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,279
of the spec there's this uh

1579
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:46,500
trustworthiness Vector which is a

1580
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,399
gigantic Matrix of predefined and

1581
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,738
customizable semantics

1582
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:55,620
um and on top of that we have a set of

1583
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,960
rules for computing the the the vectors

1584
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,520
values

1585
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,280
um and this this is it basically next

1586
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,759
slide please

1587
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,718
foreign

1588
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,739
bottom up the the types that we're using

1589
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:16,140
is we have the first one of these tiers

1590
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,480
which is the basic thing it's basically

1591
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,460
a um a bit signed in so that defines a

1592
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,860
256 uh code Point space and it's

1593
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,320
organized in four horizontal fears

1594
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,940
affirming warning contraindicated and

1595
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:34,080
one meaning this is good and this is

1596
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,320
definitely dodgy or I cannot say

1597
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,900
um and this base here is also segmented

1598
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,900
vertically in two subspaces positive is

1599
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,480
standard so we Define exactly what that

1600
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,420
means except we do that sparsely so the

1601
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,820
Matrix is bars and then a completely

1602
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:52,080
private thing

1603
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,340
for the negative numbers

1604
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,719
but the important thing to understand

1605
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:59,820
here is that even if you don't

1606
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,140
understand so we didn't the

1607
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,179
understanding needs to be that from

1608
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:05,120
private space you

1609
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,920
very Space is really uh understandable

1610
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,920
within a private domain a closed domain

1611
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,540
and so if things in the private space

1612
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:17,820
emerge from the from the from the closed

1613
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:18,900
domain then

1614
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,540
um the the downstream relying part you

1615
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,640
will not know exactly what that means

1616
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,380
the thing what what the code Point means

1617
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,120
but the second the horizontal

1618
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,940
segmentation allows the the downstream

1619
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,340
receiver to actually uh Define

1620
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,860
understand at least roughly what the

1621
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,020
thing means

1622
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:41,239
using the four categories next please

1623
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,679
okay so and then you have the

1624
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:49,920
trustworthiness claim uh which is uh a

1625
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,659
thing that is associated with a an

1626
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:54,000
appraisal category uh so for example you

1627
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,880
have executables you want to measure uh

1628
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,040
uh you want to understand whether the uh

1629
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,739
running uh code is

1630
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:04,739
um in in in the expected state or not

1631
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:07,199
you have say other categories like

1632
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,239
device identity

1633
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:11,880
um memory protection

1634
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,219
you know many

1635
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:16,020
um and to each of these categories you

1636
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,659
have the trustworthiness uh theater

1637
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:20,060
associated

1638
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:23,340
with the defined set of

1639
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,159
um semantic so for example in the case

1640
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,080
of executable number three means the

1641
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,420
specific things in the case of uh memory

1642
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:31,620
protection number three would mean

1643
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,860
another thing but both will be in the um

1644
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:39,500
affirming tier next please

1645
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,260
yeah

1646
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:46,080
so then you you put together these eight

1647
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,640
categories and that's that's what I was

1648
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,739
mentioning before this is what we have

1649
01:12:49,739 --> 01:12:51,780
predefined this is the pre-canned uh

1650
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,820
shape of the the trustworthiness Vector

1651
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,520
these are the eight sort of

1652
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,340
um uh appraisal categories that we we

1653
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:02,940
pretty fine and

1654
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,820
um yeah this is this is the core the

1655
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,400
semantic core of an attestation results

1656
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,080
is based on this next please

1657
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,420
so our 4C only provides the semanticore

1658
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,120
of of that but the downstream relaying

1659
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,880
party or Downstream verifier needs also

1660
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,920
other metadata associated with the

1661
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,260
context of evaluation contagious for

1662
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:30,000
example the identity of the verifier not

1663
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,560
just the cryptography or the entity that

1664
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,780
comes with the signature but also for

1665
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,340
example the software identity because

1666
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,840
you want to understand what the Verizon

1667
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,699
version one two three is then the

1668
01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:41,640
appraisal using plugin X Y and Z

1669
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,520
compared to another thing

1670
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,739
um you want to know when the appraisal

1671
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:48,480
happened you're going to have freshness

1672
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,880
indications right connect to the thing

1673
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,600
so roses or apoc IDs or whatever

1674
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,219
um you want to have an identifier of the

1675
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:58,320
principle policies that we used for

1676
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,800
computing the r4c vector

1677
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,440
maybe if the

1678
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,239
um verify is running inside and

1679
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,000
executive execution environment you also

1680
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,280
want to have evidence about that so you

1681
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,840
want to stash

1682
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,380
um evidence together with with the the

1683
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,080
the the the appraisal results

1684
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,480
and so you need to have these contextual

1685
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,860
stuff that are forcing doesn't Define

1686
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,280
and you need to also have a

1687
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,400
um a data a data model

1688
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,860
please you have three minutes left three

1689
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:34,800
minutes yes I will try and you have 12

1690
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,719
slides left just FYI right okay

1691
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,320
so this is a hardware

1692
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,260
so yeah so that one that was right

1693
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:49,500
before was the uh realization on cdbl of

1694
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,120
the trustworth inspector so you see the

1695
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,100
for the eight categories the the thing

1696
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,780
for them next next

1697
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,900
yeah that's what that's the thing and

1698
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,000
then what we've done we have taken that

1699
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,040
and associated with the the contextual

1700
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,320
stuff that I was mentioning before in

1701
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,420
terrain a year for for lack of better

1702
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:12,600
name and ethernet station results

1703
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,440
um clean set

1704
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,980
um and this has got the you know the

1705
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,780
status which is the the summary of the

1706
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,179
appraisal the profile because it's in it

1707
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:23,100
so anyways files and we use that for

1708
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,380
versioning also the the kind of content

1709
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,380
of this stuff uh the transformation

1710
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:31,199
transport finesse Vector at the core and

1711
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,940
then other stuff right and the important

1712
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,860
thing there is obviously wanted him to

1713
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,420
discuss and it would have some some

1714
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,900
feedback is the uh is the socket there

1715
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:43,140
to allow it extensions either ear

1716
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:44,760
extensions on the clean set please go

1717
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,980
ahead

1718
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,739
thank you Ned sorry I know you broke

1719
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:51,179
your finger

1720
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,540
so this is a an example the realization

1721
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,460
in jot

1722
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:59,719
uh next please

1723
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,159
this is this equivalent semantically but

1724
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:07,400
I realize there's a receiver caught

1725
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:12,259
token I'm set next please

1726
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:17,400
and here what we have done for the

1727
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,719
replacement review

1728
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:23,480
um as a vendor the number of vendors

1729
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:28,020
in the open so it's not a very specific

1730
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:30,300
thing but uh you know uh the the product

1731
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,580
specific thing is uh that we've added

1732
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,679
two kind of extensions in there to that

1733
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:37,020
socket one is for

1734
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,179
um sort of

1735
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:41,040
um

1736
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,900
um taking so because because we take

1737
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:45,239
different kinds of evidence with a in a

1738
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:47,460
different formats uh we want to give

1739
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:49,440
back and normalize the view of the claim

1740
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,600
set that was received uh independently

1741
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,640
of the format that was used by the by

1742
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,640
the submitter and this is what we uh we

1743
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,340
use there basically you have this

1744
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:01,020
associative array that represents the

1745
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:03,420
claim set in a normalized way and the

1746
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,580
other thing there is the verifier added

1747
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,340
claims is a bunch of uh claims that the

1748
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:11,600
verifier does as part of the

1749
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,040
appraisal right so when you're when you

1750
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,480
praise the thing you also realize other

1751
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,640
things that not necessarily are in

1752
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,159
evidence but you have received the

1753
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,239
information that you've received from

1754
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,699
supply chain or other things like say

1755
01:17:23,699 --> 01:17:25,679
certification

1756
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,920
um body please go next please well

1757
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,020
you're at a time so if you can do it

1758
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,719
quick and I was just going to ask Dave

1759
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:35,699
did we just forget to remove you from

1760
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:37,199
the queue or did you get on the Queue

1761
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,620
did you actually

1762
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,620
all right

1763
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,320
I I don't know we can

1764
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,800
please go ahead do your question okay

1765
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,540
and then I might close it with that

1766
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:59,880
Thomas okay um no problem my question is

1767
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,320
on something that you and I have not

1768
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,460
already talked about given we've already

1769
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,320
talked about other feedback on here

1770
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,500
um it defines uh space for standard and

1771
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,360
private in other words out of those uh

1772
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,640
numbers there the Anna section just says

1773
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,260
see body I'm imagining that you'd want

1774
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,940
an INR registry for all the standard

1775
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,880
ones and that you'd want some way of

1776
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:18,840
having

1777
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,060
um implementations or vendors or

1778
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,440
whatever specify what they're going to

1779
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,940
use for private use out of the other out

1780
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,100
of the negative numbers and my question

1781
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,560
is you haven't really um specified the

1782
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,840
full eat profile in the way that the eat

1783
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,460
document requires profiles doesn't be

1784
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:35,940
specified and so my question is for the

1785
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,620
private space the negative numbers how

1786
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:38,940
do you know what the interpretation is

1787
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,679
are you planning on putting like OEM ID

1788
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:42,960
or something into the e-profile or how

1789
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,880
would you actually be able to tell on

1790
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,100
receipt what the negative number is

1791
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,679
semantics

1792
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:50,880
you can tell what the tier is but you've

1793
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,140
got a whole bunch of ranges and it says

1794
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,719
well this is a non-standard reason how

1795
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,860
do I know what the non-standard reason

1796
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:57,840
is unless I know what like the OEM ID or

1797
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,480
whatever the the vendor ID like in DHCP

1798
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,500
you have the thing but then you got

1799
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,719
another option that tells you how to

1800
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:05,699
identify which private spaces is out of

1801
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:08,219
so right that would be

1802
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:09,840
that would be a profile thing all right

1803
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,179
so I think that because AR for SI is a

1804
01:19:12,179 --> 01:19:14,219
each profile then you can use that it's

1805
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:16,020
not currently written up as such but I

1806
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,640
think you probably want something like

1807
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,739
oemid is what tells you how to identify

1808
01:19:19,739 --> 01:19:21,060
how to interpret the private space

1809
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,179
that's my question so I would take that

1810
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:26,400
as a a recommendation for update on the

1811
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,420
draft

1812
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:30,600
okay so with that I I apologize we need

1813
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,159
to move on to the next one but you're

1814
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:34,920
still here uh the next one up is secure

1815
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:38,040
routing no no no sorry eat media types

1816
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:41,940
right okay cool thank you

1817
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,880
oh this one would be short I promise

1818
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,199
well

1819
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:48,300
yeah you went two minutes over on that

1820
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,500
one so

1821
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,500
um

1822
01:19:51,739 --> 01:19:54,659
the last presentation suit Brendan we

1823
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:57,320
may not get to

1824
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:02,640
okay so in your types perfect

1825
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,199
um

1826
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:08,599
next next I think these are just

1827
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,380
nothing but

1828
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:13,440
um okay recap this is the uh it type

1829
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,260
system six production basically three uh

1830
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:18,300
the the downside the signed and the

1831
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,580
bundle and for each of the production we

1832
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:23,940
have allocated a media type next please

1833
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,500
and this is the table should be the

1834
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,140
table of the of the all the media types

1835
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:30,239
uh the two chord the two protected one

1836
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,560
the two bundles and the two are

1837
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,719
unprotected and these are the names that

1838
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:35,940
they use now we have renamed the uh each

1839
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:38,820
damper to each one because now his

1840
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:42,799
bundle is not there anymore next please

1841
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,140
foreign

1842
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,580
profile to it profile for consistency

1843
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:56,580
with it closed four eight was the other

1844
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,560
one related to the downstream uh

1845
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,080
repercussions of the change in naming in

1846
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,900
the heat spec we've done we remove the

1847
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,960
dev and replace with bun and then we had

1848
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,760
a couple of issues associated with

1849
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,920
feedback the tutorial feedback that we

1850
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,420
got from the event car thank you very

1851
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,760
much I think we have addressed your your

1852
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,620
stuff but if you want to double check

1853
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,360
just click on those comments and see

1854
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,739
whether next please

1855
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,800
foreign

1856
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:33,420
because uh if you use media types in the

1857
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:37,140
textual form you don't need to any to do

1858
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,719
anything in order to use a specific

1859
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:42,540
profile because you just tack you just

1860
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,580
take the you just take the um the

1861
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,739
profile ID inside the media type

1862
01:21:46,739 --> 01:21:49,560
parameter but for crop you cannot at

1863
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,780
this point in time because

1864
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,280
um because the content formats are

1865
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,600
different from media types basically

1866
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,300
they are compressed uh code points and

1867
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,460
they are not very

1868
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:02,480
um you know flexible

1869
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:06,120
so there's a draft that I have

1870
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,300
proposed in court is probably time to

1871
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,340
solve a sort of bigger problem here

1872
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:14,699
which is a generic transfer of media

1873
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:15,780
type parameters

1874
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,580
which is the CF parameterized whatever

1875
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,739
and we've discussed this in an interim

1876
01:22:19,739 --> 01:22:21,900
I've got excellent feedback I've updated

1877
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,600
it but what I'm what I want to say here

1878
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,300
is that this black this the dependency

1879
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,820
on this mechanism is not blocking for

1880
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,520
the rest it's just

1881
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,739
not ideal but it's okay we can go on

1882
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:35,640
without

1883
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,340
um we will return that was raised by

1884
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,199
many see you think at adoption for

1885
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:42,239
providing a better use case in Russia

1886
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:43,679
now which I think is going to be you

1887
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,260
know a few lines more in the in the

1888
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,300
introduction and I'm happy to do that

1889
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:51,060
you know quickly and as soon as possible

1890
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:54,960
and the and the 12 is the most important

1891
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,400
one which you want to discuss here is

1892
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,860
the early location of media types media

1893
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:02,900
typing so please next

1894
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,060
we have a standard track document for

1895
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,520
for requesting the the the thank you

1896
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,580
types we have clear rules expressed

1897
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:25,320
there I think

1898
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,840
um and uh and we are now stable because

1899
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,940
the only thing that was a bit wobbly the

1900
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:32,400
dev thing has been settled and so the

1901
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,400
last point before we can request an

1902
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,159
early location which I think we want to

1903
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,480
have at least from my perspective

1904
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,520
because we want to use it and we'd like

1905
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,860
to use them now uh is the working Group

1906
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:45,600
shares and we are directed to judge

1907
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,120
where they're

1908
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:50,940
there's interest and and and

1909
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:54,360
and and the other things you know

1910
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,219
match up man

1911
01:23:56,219 --> 01:23:59,940
so you're asking if we can do uh fairly

1912
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:02,580
early application of these six media

1913
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,980
times yeah

1914
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,159
um

1915
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,340
I think it's okay the question is on the

1916
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,980
stability and changes yeah

1917
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,080
um

1918
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,120
let me go back and confer with the other

1919
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,480
chairs Roman I think it may be okay if

1920
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,919
if we think it's stable enough

1921
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,940
given our last experience with this

1922
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,760
let's do a really good check on the

1923
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,080
mailing list yeah okay okay

1924
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:42,360
sure so we'll we'll put on the mail list

1925
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,699
to see if we're early or absolutely

1926
01:24:44,699 --> 01:24:47,040
fantastic thank you your group agrees

1927
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,739
we're ready to do for allocation okay

1928
01:24:49,739 --> 01:24:52,400
next please

1929
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:56,880
no no I think there's none oh no yeah

1930
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,800
it's a stupid thing uh so yeah we're

1931
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,140
gonna go to the early location and we'll

1932
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:04,199
close the the blocking issues and uh and

1933
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,239
then we can submit too

1934
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,460
and at that point in time I think we are

1935
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:11,719
ready for working group let's go

1936
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,460
and we won a beer is that it

1937
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:16,739
well find us find a bug and then you'll

1938
01:25:16,739 --> 01:25:19,260
get my view from me

1939
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:22,640
okay thanks

1940
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,060
all right

1941
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:24,960
um

1942
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,840
everything keeps spilling over next is

1943
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,480
secure routing

1944
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,559
who is up

1945
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:37,100
okay

1946
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:41,400
are you here are you remote

1947
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,699
foreign

1948
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,659
yes okay

1949
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,440
so I'm Gonna Give You nine minutes

1950
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,360
okay nine minutes

1951
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,839
okay

1952
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,840
we have three new drafts focusing on

1953
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,800
secure routine

1954
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,739
I believe most of us have been have seen

1955
01:26:10,739 --> 01:26:16,080
security oh no oh that's yes

1956
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,780
security or trust the routine more than

1957
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:21,840
once what do you mean by security here

1958
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,679
that is pro-wide secure security service

1959
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:30,060
for user link transmission for example

1960
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:34,260
traffic Furrow from a to F need IPS

1961
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:37,380
function then the forwarding Parts can

1962
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:40,620
only the green line

1963
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:43,280
next

1964
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:52,920
IP network is to try to deliver at the

1965
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,139
same time there are many security

1966
01:26:55,139 --> 01:26:58,560
functions in the network to ensure the

1967
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,860
availability of the network why security

1968
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:06,239
is required for Network operators

1969
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,719
through security routine can reduce

1970
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:12,300
users attacks on the network

1971
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:13,920
and

1972
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,100
on the other hand due to the Improvement

1973
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:20,760
of network security we can provide users

1974
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,780
with differentiated security service

1975
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:28,380
of course with the frequent occurrence

1976
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,400
of

1977
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,580
security incidents our users are more

1978
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,540
sensitive to security

1979
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:38,760
therefore it also puts forward higher

1980
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:43,139
requirements the users hope that the

1981
01:27:43,139 --> 01:27:45,780
operator can provide the link page

1982
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:48,179
matching their series

1983
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:51,420
security requirements and provide

1984
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:55,440
corresponding security service

1985
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,699
next things

1986
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:05,340
the requirements are very clear why is

1987
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:08,179
it impossible to achieve security

1988
01:28:08,179 --> 01:28:11,699
early routine protocols considered

1989
01:28:11,699 --> 01:28:14,840
accessibility so Network routing

1990
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:19,380
strategy is independent of security the

1991
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:24,780
order is from our network is experience

1992
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:28,199
the management and use of existing

1993
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:31,500
security devices are separated from the

1994
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,760
IP network

1995
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,400
to provide security service while

1996
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:38,460
transmitting data we need to consite

1997
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:41,940
both security processing and the routing

1998
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:43,620
process

1999
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,639
next things

2000
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:53,159
these are the security routine model so

2001
01:28:53,159 --> 01:28:56,580
when the user needs the S2 function we

2002
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:59,580
can only choose the going Pace from a to

2003
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:03,060
c and then to D but when the user needs

2004
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:08,159
S4 function change the Red Pass

2005
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:11,420
next thing

2006
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:18,239
we see security is the goal is to

2007
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:22,260
provide secure service so what security

2008
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:25,340
capabilities are provided

2009
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:30,540
such as entity does IPS IDs and so on in

2010
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:33,239
another draft

2011
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:36,000
optimize the security functions we try

2012
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,480
to list the capability set of existing

2013
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:43,139
security products according to the ipdrr

2014
01:29:43,139 --> 01:29:44,159
mode

2015
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:47,540
next says

2016
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:53,760
so what to do for secure routine

2017
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,460
the first is to collect the nose

2018
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:59,159
security capabilities to the controller

2019
01:29:59,159 --> 01:30:01,980
and then the control form routine paste

2020
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,219
according to the user's security

2021
01:30:04,219 --> 01:30:07,320
requirements finder issue the routine

2022
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,960
Pace this may be implemented through

2023
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:14,060
routing programming Technologies usually

2024
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:17,040
distributed to tenure entrance nodes

2025
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:20,460
when using segment routine V6

2026
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:23,239
next

2027
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,480
then how to get no security capabilities

2028
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:37,020
such informations we propose to extend

2029
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:40,940
the protocol bgpls to carry the security

2030
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:44,699
capabilities of the node it is defined

2031
01:30:44,699 --> 01:30:47,600
in the RC Samsung

2032
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,440
52 is standards the nosbond distribution

2033
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,739
of Link State and the traffic

2034
01:30:54,739 --> 01:30:59,420
engineering information using PCP

2035
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:03,120
describes a mechanism by which link

2036
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,760
State and traffic engineering

2037
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,159
information can be collected from

2038
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,980
networks ensured with external

2039
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,320
components using the P2P routine

2040
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,679
protocol

2041
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,860
uh this protocol defines three types of

2042
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,840
uh

2043
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,340
Network layer reachability information

2044
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:32,120
that is that are note link and preface

2045
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:36,659
on inner finger one

2046
01:31:36,659 --> 01:31:39,840
is your scaring the security capability

2047
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,219
of the local node through their

2048
01:31:43,219 --> 01:31:48,000
hpls type note next

2049
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:57,120
and figure 5 shows using the link type

2050
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:01,380
to carry the capability informations

2051
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:04,100
next

2052
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:11,699
yes and the last finger here is use uh

2053
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:15,000
the prefix type to carry the optimal

2054
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,400
systems in security capabilities

2055
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:24,020
next things

2056
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:31,500
two pro white external Security Services

2057
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:35,580
we need a complete set of process we

2058
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:38,280
think the step one is to collect no

2059
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:42,920
security capabilities from the ordinals

2060
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,900
then and the Step 2 is initial

2061
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:49,199
configuration on security devices or

2062
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:51,560
software Wells

2063
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:55,199
and last the step three is distribute

2064
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,900
routine pace

2065
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:01,440
with these three steps then when an

2066
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,980
attack occurs security defense can be

2067
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:07,580
triggered

2068
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,760
next please

2069
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:20,400
this topic needs more discussion this is

2070
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:24,300
the first presentation in a rest work

2071
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,120
group and

2072
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:31,320
and now we do not fight and shoot for

2073
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:35,460
Walker in the security area so

2074
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:39,780
um I need advice to apply for a special

2075
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:44,280
email list or further discussion

2076
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:48,600
such like how how to use the uh security

2077
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,580
capabilities

2078
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:54,540
except from secure writing pace and how

2079
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:58,320
to timely and efficient schedule the use

2080
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:02,000
of security functions

2081
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:06,239
because we need more discussion yes yeah

2082
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,699
so you're out of time but I'm gonna let

2083
01:34:08,699 --> 01:34:11,820
Eric one question but I will um to your

2084
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:15,540
questions on next to do mingling

2085
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:18,420
um my suggestion is for you to present

2086
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:21,739
it at SEC dispatch

2087
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,860
ah I'm passing this patch

2088
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,719
yeah the security dispatch because

2089
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:31,080
you're talking about the general routing

2090
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:34,940
I'm not sure that I can see potential

2091
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:38,839
connections with rats

2092
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,920
um

2093
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,960
but for some of those requests I would

2094
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,580
take it to the SEC dispatch

2095
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,179
um

2096
01:34:48,179 --> 01:34:50,880
do you have a quick question on this or

2097
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,580
can we move on

2098
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:55,460
go ahead no quick question

2099
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:59,940
I should have said I cut the cue Diego

2100
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:02,580
I like where you're going with this in

2101
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,860
terms of pulling out requirements

2102
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,960
um I do think that there's value in

2103
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,179
pulling out requirements from The

2104
01:35:09,179 --> 01:35:11,639
Trusted path routing work do you see

2105
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:13,860
anything that's not interested path

2106
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:17,400
routing functionally that you need or

2107
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,900
see covered with your work

2108
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:24,320
everything

2109
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:29,219
yes ah

2110
01:35:29,219 --> 01:35:32,639
trust the rooting and secure routine I I

2111
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,420
do not get the clear point of your

2112
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:39,080
suggestions

2113
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,639
really what I was asking is the

2114
01:35:41,639 --> 01:35:43,679
functional requirements

2115
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,080
match up to some of the functional

2116
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:49,679
requirements that are part of the

2117
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:52,560
trusted path routing document in essence

2118
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,719
it pulls the requirements out from the

2119
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:57,480
solution and that's good do you have

2120
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:00,000
other requirements which are not in the

2121
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,280
trusted path routing draft and we can

2122
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:05,699
take that online if if you want yeah

2123
01:36:05,699 --> 01:36:08,580
well as the chair and because we're low

2124
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:11,100
on time if I could just suggest that you

2125
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:13,440
guys take that offline

2126
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:18,300
okay we can discuss offline

2127
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:21,300
all right thank you

2128
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:25,020
up next we have at the stations in the

2129
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:26,699
TLs

2130
01:36:26,699 --> 01:36:30,379
is that hummus

2131
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,280
I'm gonna give you the one minute

2132
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,679
warning because okay

2133
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,020
one minute one minute warning but I hope

2134
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:44,699
that's not what nature sounds okay

2135
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:50,219
yes so in the previous presentation

2136
01:36:50,219 --> 01:36:52,560
specifically it you have heard about all

2137
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,060
the claims and the token and the

2138
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,679
signature covering the token and so on

2139
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,060
we've gone through this in a group for

2140
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:00,000
quite a while already in essence it's a

2141
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,360
better token um but this work that we

2142
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,060
recently submitted it's about

2143
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:09,300
um buying that token also do a key uh

2144
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,560
you could call it a proof possession

2145
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,600
token

2146
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,340
and there are use cases where this is

2147
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:17,100
needed specifically if you want to put

2148
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:20,040
at the station information in a in a

2149
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,360
larger context when you actually

2150
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,699
establish a secure Channel like we do in

2151
01:37:23,699 --> 01:37:24,920
both DLS

2152
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,699
this work

2153
01:37:26,699 --> 01:37:30,300
um we started it by using it but it can

2154
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,040
be applied more generically and the

2155
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,560
design is intentionally made so that you

2156
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,840
can also use other attestation

2157
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,699
Technologies other than eat

2158
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:41,520
next one it's actually a very short

2159
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:45,060
presentation uh this is what you find in

2160
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:47,880
the document which is uh shown at the

2161
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:49,620
last slide

2162
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,960
um so we came up with what we call a key

2163
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,420
attestation token which is the there are

2164
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:57,060
lots of new acronyms of course

2165
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,040
um our main contribution of this work

2166
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:03,060
because this is uh the idea of uh using

2167
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:05,100
key attestation is not something we came

2168
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,080
up with that exists already for I don't

2169
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,940
know how many years

2170
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:11,540
um this key attestation token

2171
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:13,980
and the path which is called the

2172
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:17,340
platform attestation token is uh

2173
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,500
combined together in a bundle so you

2174
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,420
actually

2175
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:23,880
convey in a protocol exchange to tokens

2176
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:26,100
uh with different semantics

2177
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:29,219
the platform attestation is

2178
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:32,400
what you what we also use today with the

2179
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:36,000
the e-token to make an uh assessment

2180
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,679
about what's running on the on the

2181
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,420
device what Hardware Etc so there's

2182
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:41,580
nothing new here

2183
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:44,159
um and we want to reuse the existing

2184
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:47,400
software because that's uh uh minimal

2185
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,800
amount of software on the device and

2186
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,440
then augment it with a second token and

2187
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:56,219
where you see specifically one key uh

2188
01:38:56,219 --> 01:38:58,620
public key being added this identity key

2189
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:00,540
and that key

2190
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:04,380
is one that is used uh in a TLS

2191
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:06,420
handshake for example

2192
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:08,760
right specifically in this uh in our

2193
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,260
document

2194
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:13,800
in depending on how

2195
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,440
uh whether the client is the test or the

2196
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:19,320
server side is the adjuster

2197
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:23,100
and if let's assume uh for examples

2198
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,440
we've used uh post cases but let's

2199
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:28,020
assume the client does the attestation

2200
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:30,540
it generates and that's on the next

2201
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:31,380
slide

2202
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:34,100
uh

2203
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:38,760
um

2204
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,940
the the client TLS client uh creates

2205
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:45,540
this uh identity key pair

2206
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,880
it obtains the nonce from the

2207
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:50,400
uh from the server side

2208
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,920
um like in in it you would do to do the

2209
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,780
freshness

2210
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,520
um the client would create this bundle

2211
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,920
uh would create the the platform

2212
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,719
attestation and then also the key at the

2213
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,100
station token like shown on the previous

2214
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:06,480
slide and it uh includes the identity

2215
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,920
key the public key and the key

2216
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,840
attestation token and also

2217
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:13,980
um as a mechanism the nuns for freshness

2218
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:17,400
it then transmits that bundle in a 30 in

2219
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,460
a certificate message to the server

2220
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:23,760
instead of the x509 certificate uh which

2221
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,580
was which we always used

2222
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:29,219
but then it also has to prove the

2223
01:40:29,219 --> 01:40:30,600
possession of the private key

2224
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:33,659
corresponding to this identity key which

2225
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:36,060
is what the certificate verify uh

2226
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,739
message does

2227
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:40,699
so on what does this then provide the uh

2228
01:40:40,699 --> 01:40:43,500
the server side it then knows based on

2229
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,080
the platform at the station token what

2230
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,000
type of software is running on that

2231
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,679
nothing has been modified that there's

2232
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:52,080
uh specific Fingerprints of the firmware

2233
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,840
and and potentially software on high up

2234
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,659
on the stack and it also knows that the

2235
01:40:57,659 --> 01:40:59,760
software used to produce

2236
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,739
um this key at the station token is also

2237
01:41:01,739 --> 01:41:03,540
unmodified

2238
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:09,179
and it also knows uh that the the

2239
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:10,739
private key corresponding to this

2240
01:41:10,739 --> 01:41:13,440
identity key is stored in a in in the

2241
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,300
Hardware's uh

2242
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,480
um sort of security boundary so it's not

2243
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:22,199
cannot be exported or released

2244
01:41:22,199 --> 01:41:23,340
um

2245
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:25,560
and

2246
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:27,960
and thereby

2247
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,600
um it knows that the client the TLs

2248
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,520
client has

2249
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:33,060
um

2250
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:35,580
possession of that private key

2251
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:38,040
I forgot to give you the one minute okay

2252
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,800
you forgot uh

2253
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,199
um just please wrap up yeah Thomas has

2254
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:45,659
another document the uh the message

2255
01:41:45,659 --> 01:41:47,580
wrapper that provides this generic

2256
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,739
framing to also include other

2257
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:52,560
attestation technology like uh dbm based

2258
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,380
stuff and so on intra TLS exchange and

2259
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:58,020
it's our attempt to

2260
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:01,920
use attestation more generically in in

2261
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,780
sort of like protocols like DLS or

2262
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,699
higher layer protocols

2263
01:42:05,699 --> 01:42:08,460
okay looks like this code uh from the

2264
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:11,520
hackathon look at it uh try it out and

2265
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,780
if you're interested come to me I'll

2266
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:14,280
show you how the code Works actually in

2267
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,739
the in the subsequent happy hour we

2268
01:42:16,739 --> 01:42:18,420
actually show it to you if you want oh

2269
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:21,900
cool okay Q is closed Hank make it quick

2270
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:25,619
yeah but you haven't closed before me

2271
01:42:25,619 --> 01:42:27,119
um hi this is Hank

2272
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:29,460
um that's the future

2273
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:31,500
um so yeah you just said it there's a

2274
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,000
lot of illustration Technologies out

2275
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,280
there and you're inheriting I don't know

2276
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,040
if uh um consciously or just by accident

2277
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:39,600
like

2278
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:42,719
it's 75 of TCG terminology and your

2279
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:43,920
things there

2280
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,920
so one team Wiseman is not here uh

2281
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:50,219
unfortunately due to a certain issue but

2282
01:42:50,219 --> 01:42:52,139
maybe we should have a uh

2283
01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:54,300
coordination call and get these things

2284
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:56,760
like super aligned okay so there will be

2285
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,440
no friction that would be a problem so

2286
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,780
we get from the 75 to 100 alignment yeah

2287
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:04,040
that would be awesome yeah exactly

2288
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:08,280
okay I think the next one is eat here at

2289
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,639
the station

2290
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:16,040
oh you did both

2291
01:43:18,199 --> 01:43:21,719
you're awesome I gave you five minutes

2292
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:25,460
for and you did both

2293
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,920
okay then uh

2294
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:33,920
we have conceptual message wrapper

2295
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,639
who who's that

2296
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:43,159
it's time

2297
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:51,679
sorry yes I was a bit distracted sorry

2298
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:54,060
so I thought I thought Hannis was doing

2299
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,480
this as well

2300
01:43:57,540 --> 01:43:59,400
you're doing it yeah yeah you're right

2301
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,380
yeah that's why I thought but is these

2302
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:03,719
in the same bundle as um as the one is

2303
01:44:03,719 --> 01:44:05,639
the basically the encapsulation that

2304
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:07,199
allows these

2305
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:09,420
um agnosticism about the the the

2306
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:11,280
attestation

2307
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,179
um

2308
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:14,580
messages that are transported in the

2309
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:16,080
protocol yeah

2310
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:19,380
not just in TLS as Hannah said in

2311
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:21,420
different

2312
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:25,219
high level protocols so next please

2313
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:30,800
so this is this uniform encapsulation

2314
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,080
for any right conceptual message and the

2315
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,420
link there if you click it goes to the

2316
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:38,280
architecture where the last conceptual

2317
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,500
messages are explained I'm talking about

2318
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,780
artificial results evidence as well as

2319
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:45,300
uh endorsements and ref values whatever

2320
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:48,500
next please

2321
01:44:51,239 --> 01:44:54,480
so example use cases for this for

2322
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,940
example if you want to to embed evidence

2323
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:59,219
or endorsements or ref values or

2324
01:44:59,219 --> 01:45:00,719
decision results in certificates and

2325
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:02,600
crls and and

2326
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:06,960
csrs extension like dice TCG dice does

2327
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,719
then you can use this

2328
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:11,699
TLS tested Harris was presenting is

2329
01:45:11,699 --> 01:45:13,320
another use case for this we use stash

2330
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:15,119
that in the in the end Shake message in

2331
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:17,580
the relevant and Sheet messages you have

2332
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:20,100
a use case for this phone with when you

2333
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:22,380
use it in in restful apis

2334
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:25,020
for embedding palers inside you know

2335
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:28,440
bigger objects

2336
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:31,020
and we were using this in varies in the

2337
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:34,619
verifier but it could also be used for

2338
01:45:34,619 --> 01:45:37,139
um for archival long-term archival for

2339
01:45:37,139 --> 01:45:38,880
example of Association results you know

2340
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,520
spaces and objects thanks please

2341
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,840
so there are many use cases

2342
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,139
and conversion on a common format allows

2343
01:45:49,139 --> 01:45:51,119
uh

2344
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:53,780
this

2345
01:45:55,159 --> 01:45:57,420
increased Ingenuity in the in the

2346
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:58,820
ecosystem

2347
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:02,159
therefore easier consumption by all the

2348
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:03,480
actors all the roles in the in the

2349
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:06,060
architecture and as well as the ability

2350
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:08,760
to compose different protocols without

2351
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:11,340
doing the in Capital Cap right multiple

2352
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:15,179
times it just extract and push it in

2353
01:46:15,179 --> 01:46:17,820
from one protocol into the other as is

2354
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:20,219
and this is a deeper thing is a

2355
01:46:20,219 --> 01:46:22,739
byproduct of the aspect that we can we

2356
01:46:22,739 --> 01:46:25,500
can have uh interfaces to a testing

2357
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,699
environments that can become more

2358
01:46:26,699 --> 01:46:30,799
uniform in the long term next please

2359
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,639
so we went through design phases you

2360
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:37,800
know two examples very complex design

2361
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:39,719
yeah and then we decided that that was

2362
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:42,900
not the case so next please

2363
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,840
and we ended up doing

2364
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:49,400
this yay this is

2365
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:52,020
so next please this is the actual design

2366
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:55,860
I'm not joking terrible

2367
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,639
um and and the core idea is that we we

2368
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:01,619
parasite the existing media type

2369
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:03,659
ecosystem to to get the typing

2370
01:47:03,659 --> 01:47:06,659
information and and from that we derive

2371
01:47:06,659 --> 01:47:10,520
the the encapsulation in in in

2372
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:15,199
two ways one next please

2373
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:18,560
uh

2374
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,960
right when is the array thing

2375
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,360
where we have a type of value and the

2376
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,239
type is either a media type string for

2377
01:47:27,239 --> 01:47:29,520
the Json serialization or even the C

2378
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:32,580
board and or a co-op content format

2379
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:34,260
could point

2380
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:37,800
so we have this to to buys uh you need

2381
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,900
or you have the long string depending on

2382
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:42,060
what you want to do then what you have

2383
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,900
next please

2384
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:50,580
and and the value is either a c board by

2385
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:53,040
string for receiver encoding or a b64

2386
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,139
URL save string without padding for Json

2387
01:47:55,139 --> 01:47:59,340
civilizations that's it next please

2388
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:01,800
so this is opaque and the type of

2389
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,619
information is outside so this is an

2390
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:07,380
example to drive it through the whole

2391
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:09,179
cycle you won't go ahead and register

2392
01:48:09,179 --> 01:48:11,460
application vendor entails sgx because

2393
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:15,179
you want to ship a Intel sgx evidence

2394
01:48:15,179 --> 01:48:17,219
and you also want to register a

2395
01:48:17,219 --> 01:48:19,139
compressed model format that is

2396
01:48:19,139 --> 01:48:20,820
semantically equivalent with that let's

2397
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:22,320
say is three

2398
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:27,679
three thirty thousand one next please

2399
01:48:29,219 --> 01:48:30,560
um

2400
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:33,239
so the first vegetation you do you do an

2401
01:48:33,239 --> 01:48:36,960
email to the Ina expert uh and and the

2402
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,560
second because the code point the

2403
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,940
informative you're requesting is more

2404
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:45,900
than 10 000 you go uh fcfs and that's

2405
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,639
another email through Ayana this time

2406
01:48:47,639 --> 01:48:49,260
you don't have to go through extra

2407
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:52,760
review altogether next please

2408
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:57,780
and then when you've done that you can

2409
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:01,080
achieve these two encoding here

2410
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,659
um the example the symbol type event on

2411
01:49:03,659 --> 01:49:05,280
the Json Temple valve

2412
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:08,059
thanks please

2413
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:14,580
but because of casting and Michael I

2414
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:18,420
think uh you know we have 9277 and that

2415
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,639
thing gives us a fantastic injection

2416
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,619
which is a TM and GM function that is

2417
01:49:22,619 --> 01:49:25,980
very good function that the injects the

2418
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:28,080
whole of the corrupt qualiformal space

2419
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,340
into a bunch of

2420
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:34,080
little segment of the of the sibo tank

2421
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:38,280
space so if we start from CF 3000 3001

2422
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:41,400
you get into magic receiver and you can

2423
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:44,460
use it in in this other encapsulation

2424
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:47,100
so yeah and this is the the alternative

2425
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:48,719
encapsulation that based on support tax

2426
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:51,540
this is used by the the TCG guys and the

2427
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:55,820
dice extension next please

2428
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,119
I I don't know how you asked for five

2429
01:50:00,119 --> 01:50:05,659
minutes live because would do that

2430
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:12,119
so yes exactly so the bureaucracy is

2431
01:50:12,119 --> 01:50:13,980
quite lightweight we don't have to

2432
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:16,199
Define any uh registration inside the

2433
01:50:16,199 --> 01:50:18,840
the the the the document because

2434
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:21,860
everything is taken care of by existing

2435
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:23,940
next please

2436
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:26,340
and it's quite simple right except the

2437
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:28,980
first step which as an extra review then

2438
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:31,199
uh the rest should be really automatic

2439
01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:34,679
and these are true uh typical simulation

2440
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:35,880
about the overhead which is basically

2441
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,280
say they are the same next please why

2442
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:39,780
are there any simple tags or the type

2443
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:41,580
salary next please

2444
01:50:41,580 --> 01:50:44,580
and in summary we have a simple trivial

2445
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:48,739
format we have a very simple uh um

2446
01:50:48,739 --> 01:50:51,020
registration mechanics

2447
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:53,580
uh this is useful in a number of

2448
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:56,100
different scenarios uh that I could have

2449
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:58,320
effectively done just that because

2450
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:01,380
that's that's the whole thing

2451
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:04,380
um and the question is uh whether we

2452
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:06,179
want to whether the group is interested

2453
01:51:06,179 --> 01:51:07,980
whether we want to adopt maybe in the

2454
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:08,780
long run

2455
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:11,639
I think it was a relatively new

2456
01:51:11,639 --> 01:51:13,380
submission so we need to ask for

2457
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:15,239
comments and feedback on the mail list

2458
01:51:15,239 --> 01:51:18,179
yeah right we have uh two I think we

2459
01:51:18,179 --> 01:51:21,659
have zero one uh out so we have it's in

2460
01:51:21,659 --> 01:51:23,340
a decent State very very decent I would

2461
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:26,580
say it's readable actually so if and

2462
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:28,260
then and it's short so if people could

2463
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:30,000
take a look at that would be much

2464
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,820
appreciated so we can solicit feedback

2465
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:35,159
on on the mail list thank you very much

2466
01:51:35,159 --> 01:51:37,139
we're sharing on time and then

2467
01:51:37,139 --> 01:51:39,300
we can proceed from there excellent

2468
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,739
thank you

2469
01:51:40,739 --> 01:51:43,380
thank you

2470
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:45,060
all right

2471
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:45,840
um

2472
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,119
I think we may only have time for one

2473
01:51:48,119 --> 01:51:51,060
more unless Carson you can speak super

2474
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:53,360
fast

2475
01:51:57,659 --> 01:52:00,960
I well I have to run the queue here but

2476
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:03,600
I can't because I'm a co-op I'm a

2477
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:06,540
co-author on this yeah no you're up for

2478
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:09,780
the unencrypted

2479
01:52:12,619 --> 01:52:16,920
I thought I uploaded the right deck

2480
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:19,320
we went through this and I uploaded the

2481
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:21,679
right one

2482
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:24,600
you talked about that in the previous

2483
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,880
meeting okay let me talk about the

2484
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,800
slides You Don't See

2485
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:33,080
um you saw me upload the right version

2486
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,860
uh

2487
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:44,159
yeah so what does that say is uh we have

2488
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,619
a document out

2489
01:52:46,619 --> 01:52:48,980
um called unprotected

2490
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:51,900
cwt claim sets

2491
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:55,139
and that has been around for a while

2492
01:52:55,139 --> 01:52:58,320
it has been in a kind of blocking stage

2493
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,239
for the last four months or so because

2494
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:02,880
we wanted to make sure that we fully

2495
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,739
align with each

2496
01:53:04,739 --> 01:53:07,080
with each now

2497
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:09,119
being nearly done

2498
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:11,940
it's probably a good idea to unblock

2499
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:14,159
use ccs

2500
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:17,940
and the two next steps we are proposing

2501
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:20,100
is to do a working class call

2502
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:23,239
and to profit

2503
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,360
so I'm going to speak it as an

2504
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,280
individual contributor since I'm a

2505
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:32,340
co-author for this so we received some

2506
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:33,600
feedback

2507
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,460
there's

2508
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:37,980
like a year ago which we finally have

2509
01:53:37,980 --> 01:53:39,179
resolved

2510
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:41,159
um we haven't heard any more feedback

2511
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:44,040
and that's why Carson is reporting that

2512
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,199
we believe the draft is stable

2513
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:48,780
but the question is for the other chairs

2514
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:51,500
to respond

2515
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:54,780
so this is Hank a fellow co-author

2516
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:56,880
um I think working Google Glass called

2517
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:58,739
with um

2518
01:53:58,739 --> 01:54:00,540
um nudges into the right way I think

2519
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:03,360
there might be a uh two

2520
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:05,699
things that really need review I think

2521
01:54:05,699 --> 01:54:07,320
the working Google Glass Cloud process

2522
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:11,040
is the exactly correct way to uh to uh

2523
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:13,880
find out if this is on the right track

2524
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:17,699
and so I think uh even without being

2525
01:54:17,699 --> 01:54:19,560
entirely sure about this I think working

2526
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:21,719
group has probably will show that

2527
01:54:21,719 --> 01:54:23,639
that's my personal point of view and

2528
01:54:23,639 --> 01:54:25,980
there's the one uh that will do the

2529
01:54:25,980 --> 01:54:27,840
undenting

2530
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:30,560
coming up

2531
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:36,060
comments and you address that and I have

2532
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:39,600
other comments which I shared uh an

2533
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:41,940
initial bunch of them um and I want to

2534
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:43,860
discuss them more but I I agree with the

2535
01:54:43,860 --> 01:54:45,780
I think that's you know triggering the

2536
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:47,960
process is the right way to actually

2537
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:51,000
make the discussion happen and you know

2538
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,639
finalize the product which is

2539
01:54:53,639 --> 01:54:55,860
yeah we could use this week to actually

2540
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:58,560
look at your newer set of comments yeah

2541
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,239
and if there is a change that it's

2542
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:03,678
needed we could even resubmit

2543
01:55:07,219 --> 01:55:11,520
so to recap the we have changes that are

2544
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:15,360
pending for the UCCS draft or uh is the

2545
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,699
one that's that's uploaded the most

2546
01:55:17,699 --> 01:55:19,440
current one and there are no pending

2547
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,799
changes

2548
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,239
well the the one that's uploaded is from

2549
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:25,639
July

2550
01:55:25,639 --> 01:55:29,520
and this covers all the comments that

2551
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:30,840
have been made

2552
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:33,960
and now there is a recent

2553
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:36,480
new set of comments from Thomas like

2554
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:39,000
last week this week no it was like

2555
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,639
yesterday yesterday and

2556
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:43,800
um yeah we we should be working on that

2557
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,600
but I think this is not really

2558
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:47,820
fundamental stuff but

2559
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:49,739
things that just needs to be taken care

2560
01:55:49,739 --> 01:55:51,919
of

2561
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:55,580
okay so let's

2562
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:58,340
um so it seems like we want to

2563
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:01,739
let everyone take a look at the

2564
01:56:01,739 --> 01:56:04,260
the the recent changes to read through

2565
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,580
them

2566
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:08,699
and so I think uh based on that we can

2567
01:56:08,699 --> 01:56:11,400
have some discussion to see if the list

2568
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:16,040
believes that we're ready for last call

2569
01:56:17,219 --> 01:56:19,619
yeah so how many steps do you need to

2570
01:56:19,619 --> 01:56:21,119
stick on top of

2571
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:23,280
each other I mean this document has been

2572
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:25,139
out for a while

2573
01:56:25,139 --> 01:56:25,760
um

2574
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:28,320
why not just working class code you will

2575
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:32,000
find out if it wasn't ready for that

2576
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:41,600
okay let's get a feel for the room

2577
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:45,900
so how many I think I'll use the show of

2578
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:47,580
hands tool to see how many in the room

2579
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:51,540
are I think that it's uh we're ready to

2580
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:54,300
um just go to work perhaps Kathleen can

2581
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:58,980
help you run the poll Ned yeah

2582
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:10,560
so Kathleen Ned's trying to run a poll

2583
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:13,619
but you can't type yeah

2584
01:57:13,619 --> 01:57:17,659
yeah I'm just looking for it I'm sorry

2585
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:22,880
oh okay

2586
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:27,980
all right I'm ready to put it in

2587
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,699
what should the poll say

2588
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:36,060
so uh if you're in favor of UCCS going

2589
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:37,980
to last call

2590
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:40,380
directly

2591
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:44,360
show of hands in the affirmative

2592
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:48,619
after we make the revisions

2593
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:22,340
okay I see the pole

2594
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:32,580
co-chairs you wanted time for the poll

2595
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:34,199
s

2596
01:58:34,199 --> 01:58:38,340
still climbing there's no if anyone does

2597
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:40,800
not want to raise their hand please do

2598
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,980
so

2599
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:47,299
let's just give it another minute

2600
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:51,260
and continues to climb

2601
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,719
okay it looks like it's stable now at 20

2602
01:59:03,719 --> 01:59:07,260
hands raised and one not raised

2603
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:11,659
and 21 participants of course

2604
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:17,719
oh I can't see the result

2605
01:59:18,679 --> 01:59:21,060
remote folks can see the results the

2606
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:23,040
results of the poll is there's 22

2607
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,440
participants 21 said it looks like we're

2608
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,760
ready for a working group last call

2609
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:29,940
after the uh the last revisions are

2610
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:32,159
merged so

2611
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:33,960
working group chairs do you guys want to

2612
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:34,980
roll it up

2613
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:38,340
yes working group last call

2614
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:41,460
yep uh I think that makes sense the

2615
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:44,480
working group wants to do

2616
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:50,340
okay I guess I can take the chair back

2617
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:52,560
thank you um

2618
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:55,260
all right so

2619
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:59,420
sorry Brendan we're kind of out of time

2620
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:03,619
unless you can do it in 30 seconds

2621
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,959
okay

2622
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:11,280
for remote the point was this will be in

2623
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:12,900
the suit meeting and so if you're

2624
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:14,219
