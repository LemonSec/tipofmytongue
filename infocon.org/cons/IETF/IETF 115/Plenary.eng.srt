1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,758
foreign

2
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,500
you know

3
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,140
foreign

4
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,240
can we find our seeds and check that we

5
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,400
have masks and that they are over our

6
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,979
mouth and our nose and behind our ears

7
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,979
or our neck and the ffp2 and without

8
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,159
valves and whatever else we like our

9
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,020
masks to be like and thank you very much

10
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,340
I'm going to say this again later for

11
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,079
wearing them I realize there's a

12
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
discrepancy between what's happening in

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,979
the meeting rooms and outside in The

14
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,600
Wider world in the UK

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,340
we're going to consult on that going

16
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,540
forward

17
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,179
um send us your opinions but for now in

18
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,640
here I'm Barry please oh you're actively

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,560
drinking sorry Barry just was raising

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,959
the cup that I didn't see

21
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,020
he's a professional attendee

22
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,220
so

23
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,140
um since I've all quieted you down

24
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,020
nicely welcome all to London

25
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,239
um it's great to see even more of you in

26
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,739
person than we had in Vienna and in

27
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,120
Philadelphia so I think we're on an

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,000
upswing post covet which is um what we

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,739
were hoping for we're still not quite

30
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,160
where we were before and we may never

31
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,780
get there who knows but at least sort of

32
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,120
the trend looks very good

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,920
um my name is Louis Eggert I'm the chair

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,599
of the ietf

35
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,459
um and I'm going to run uh you through

36
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,739
the presentation as sort of the MC for

37
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,360
tonight

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,459
um if you wanna at some point go to the

39
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,220
microphone you should scan this Qi code

40
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,140
now I don't it probably is going to stay

41
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,940
up but who knows uh so this is your

42
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,920
chance to get out your phone and that

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,540
will let you get in the queue because

44
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,120
that's how we're going to manage who is

45
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,920
um gonna speak next when we have open

46
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,220
mic

47
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,680
right I said this already so I made a

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,940
tweak to this slide because we're

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,180
techies and we like RFC 2119 so I added

50
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,700
some uppercase uh terms here to make

51
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,560
this sort of clearer

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,720
um to you right so the must and the

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,000
recommended and are not required and I

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,680
didn't quite go to the effort of

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,500
rewriting the rest of it but um you I

56
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,000
think this is sort of helpful you know

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,680
because it's like a protocol you know

58
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,940
you don't like it but you still got to

59
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,560
do it and it's fine

60
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,760
it brings us makes us all safer we have

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,140
some really no numbers I'm going to have

62
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,760
a slide later I hope the numbers haven't

63
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,620
increased since that slide was made but

64
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,040
it looks very good at the moment

65
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,840
um so you can take off your mask as

66
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
attaches a Barry just did to drink

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,659
something that's completely fine

68
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,940
remember to put it back up right if you

69
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,799
sit next to somebody who forgets maybe

70
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,260
you nudge them and say Hey you know

71
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,879
um

72
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,620
if you don't want to wear a mask you

73
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,180
don't have to be in this room I want to

74
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,860
also say that right you have the option

75
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,780
of leaving and then remotely

76
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,159
participating that's completely up to

77
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,420
you

78
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,680
um active speakers are people like me

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
that are babbling on the microphone not

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,399
to your neighbor

81
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,680
um so you may also take off your mask

82
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,779
and it's helpful because it makes the

83
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,220
audio a little bit clearer especially

84
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,320
for the remote attendees

85
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,540
um and we don't you know decided not to

86
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,800
uh

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
um recognize any exemptions and You

88
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
Gotta Wear a good mask that's the other

89
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,240
option

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,360
right enough about masks

91
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,580
the note well

92
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,560
um is an eye chart that you've all seen

93
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,720
many times by now so anything you say

94
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,180
here or elsewhere is a contribution to

95
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,680
the ITF that comes with certain

96
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,620
obligations be aware that you know what

97
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,960
they are before you start contributing

98
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,460
and that's all I'm going to say here we

99
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,160
also have some sort of code of conduct

100
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,139
obligations on you that um I think are

101
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,820
pretty clear

102
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,240
if they're not go read them up

103
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,580
um if you're online welcome

104
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,040
um if you decide to sort of well if

105
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,960
you're online you were joined with your

106
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,120
audio being muted in your video off and

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,259
if you want to go to the microphone to

108
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,400
ask a question you need to actively

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,220
enable your audio and I'm also going to

110
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,720
ask you to enable your video because

111
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,759
it's nice if you have a face with a

112
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,740
voice

113
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,120
um and if you have a headset and it

114
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,639
works well please use it it helps and

115
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,860
there's a long URL here with more

116
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,780
information but since you probably

117
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,100
participated earlier in the week

118
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,300
somewhere you probably know all this

119
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,479
already

120
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,740
um we have a slightly Fuller agenda than

121
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,820
normal because we have a bunch of

122
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,220
one-offs that we don't typically do so

123
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,380
we're in the welcome part uh Ted Hardy

124
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,060
from Cisco who is hosting this meeting

125
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,400
is going to do a quick presentation

126
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,900
and then we have the usual round of

127
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,660
brief updates again from me for the iitf

128
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,419
and the isg for mere equivalent for the

129
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,300
IAB from Colin Perkins for the irtf from

130
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,720
which salts for the nomcom for the iatf

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,240
LLC which is split between J Daly the

132
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,860
executive director and Jason livingood

133
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,720
who's the director of the board chair of

134
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,039
the board

135
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,080
um we have a one-off which is the our

136
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,600
the RSC introduction Alexis Rossi is

137
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,919
going to say hi

138
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,780
um I have decided I'm going to start

139
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,080
pronouncing RSE as risky and I'm just

140
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,699
going to keep doing that until everybody

141
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,759
else does the same or or I stop either

142
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,039
one of those two are possibilities

143
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,560
um but This Acronym is I mean I wish we

144
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,819
would find something with like another

145
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,039
vowel in there somewhere

146
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,979
um right we have a preview for itf116

147
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,960
and we're going to Yokohama

148
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
um that got a great Round of Applause in

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,919
Philadelphia when we announced it um

150
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,680
we're all very excited and and one of my

151
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
key achievements this week I met a

152
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,340
newcomer yesterday at the social who is

153
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,680
from Yokohama who is from Japan at least

154
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,000
and she's gonna be my dinner Booker and

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,039
I told her to pick a nice place that she

156
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,300
likes because she's obviously going to

157
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,000
come along to like facilitate things and

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,800
uh this is creating a win-win situation

159
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,419
I'm going to rely on for the entire week

160
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,280
so I don't think she knows what she got

161
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,080
herself into but it's going to work

162
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,600
really well for me at least

163
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
um we have the uh Jonathan B pastel

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,340
award which is also a special uh thing

165
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,139
that we don't do all the time so Andrew

166
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,120
Sullivan uh the CEO of istock is going

167
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,099
to present that to a very deserving

168
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,139
individual and then we have the usual

169
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,360
round of open mic uh this time the order

170
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,319
is IAB LLC isg there's a bunch of other

171
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,539
people here that aren't part of one of

172
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,639
the open mics if you want to ask them

173
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,220
questions my suggestion would be if you

174
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,440
go in line while they talk but I also

175
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,479
want to

176
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,860
caution you that we didn't really budget

177
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,720
a whole lot of time for Q a for other

178
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
slots so I might cut you and tell you to

179
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,639
take it to the mail list or somewhere

180
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,080
else

181
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,759
Warren is saying something I can't

182
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,080
understand

183
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,639
might cut you off

184
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,479
but no

185
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,739
you're so brutal

186
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,500
right uh thank you to Cisco our meeting

187
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,160

contribution to the ITF in in very very

192
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,819
many forms this is not the only time

193
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,740
we're going to see a Cisco logo on the

194
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,060
slide deck I hope I didn't give anything

195
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,580
away here but so Cisco has been been you

196
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,900
know very good for the idea for a very

197
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,919
long time we're very happy they're

198
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,300
hosting us here

199
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,280
um the organizer creates also for us the

200
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,020
food was actually very interesting I

201
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,059
don't think I ever had like a big patty

202
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,760
of meat anatolini at the same time and

203
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,140
like I was wondering what is this but

204
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,820
I've heard this for many people it was

205
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,140
very surprising combinations but they

206
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,000
were all very good and uh pretty healthy

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,740
and the art exhibition was it's amazing

208
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,300
and the music was great so so thank you

209
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,279
for that especially that was that was

210
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,180
excellent

211
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,940
and apologize the apologies to the

212
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,140
people who didn't get a ticket I don't

213
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,880
think I've ever seen as many emails

214
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,860
about you know who has a ticket can I

215
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,360
get one

216
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,860
you know there's a certain number of

217
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,420
people that Lit into these places and

218
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,680
when it's gone it's gone I think we're

219
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,380
gonna try and add something to the uh

220
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,880
new participant emails that says you

221
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,959
know because there was a lot of new

222
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,640
participants who just didn't know that

223
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,839
it was going to happen and so we're

224
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,279
going to say you know if you wanna if

225
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,200
you think you're gonna come get a ticket

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
because you always can sell it at a

227
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,920
profit later

228
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,899
so it's a little bit like an nft without

229
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,860
the ugly Parts you know it's it's

230
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,980
and maybe we should take a cut there's a

231
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,200
Marketplace here I'm sure that we gotta

232
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,000
who if anybody is like in this ipv4

233
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,560
reselling space I want to talk to you we

234
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,420

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,519
aliens and if that's not the case you

241

against me so good

334
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,920
um

335
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,720
this is the statistics and the numbers I

336
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,180
have not seen so we have quite a high

337
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,920
number of total registrations that is

338
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,899
very good to see we also have a quite

339
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,339
High number of on-site participation

340
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,560
this is more than double of Vienna and I

341
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,180
think we're probably at least a third

342
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,639
over Philadelphia so this is very nice

343
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
very good

344
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,300
um the remote fee waivers I see are

345
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,399
seeing robust use which is great that's

346
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,200
exactly what we created them for to be

347
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
like more open and more inclusive so so

348
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,920
thank you of to all of you who are

349
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,320
spending your time with us remotely and

350
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,720
and use that that is good to see you can

351
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,160
pay right if you know if you're working

352
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,800
for a company I would encourage you to

353
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,019
charge it but if you need to use a fee

354
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,480
waiver please feel free to do so

355
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,820
um we recently started being a little

356
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,500
bit more open about the on-site fee

357
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,880
waivers and we're running them I think

358
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,500
between Colin and me

359
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,000
um a little bit of an experiment to

360
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
figure out you know when do we grant

361
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,360
them and when don't we grant them and I

362
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,360
got 18 requests like granted about 11.

363
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,279
uh and and calling out a few fewer ones

364
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,079
but granted a few more

365
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,720
um we're still finding our way here uh

366
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
so in my mind what I want to see some

367
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,480
indication of economic hardship

368
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,000
um I want to see you know a reason why

369
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,920
you can be here in person but not pay

370
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,240
the fee

371
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,760
um I have a limited amount of them

372
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,620
um you know if you your organization

373
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,480
running out of travel budget is not

374
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,040
counted as economic hardship I'm very

375
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,820
sorry

376
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,260
um that's just the way and then they're

377
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,200
not set up to be like a perpetuous thing

378
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,839
so it's a one-off you know um you you're

379
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,579
doing good work once you're here I'm

380
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,980
gonna give you one of those but it's you

381
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,880
know not something that's going to

382
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,860
happen very often I'm afraid I have 10

383
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,839
easy I granted 11 that could already

384
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,940
took some negotiation

385
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,560
um this is about what we can do for the

386
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,260
on-site part but please do ask right and

387
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,000
don't feel bad if I say no or Colin says

388
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,839
no

389
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,579
um it's just the way it is

390
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,680
hackathon which is um

391
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,300
incredibly

392
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,540
um well attended still uh we had 452

393
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,420
registrations a lot on site a lot more I

394
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,399
think again compared to Vienna and

395
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,160
Philadelphia a lot of projects

396
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,899
um and a lot of people remote so so this

397
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,560
has really become one of sort of the

398
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,579
extremely good

399
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,680
um ways in which the iitf has started to

400
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,779
outreach into open source and I can

401
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,040
thank the people who are running this

402
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,139
enough and who are investing in it and I

403
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,699
can't thank the organizations that

404
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,380
supported enough it's really become sort

405
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,019
of a core event at the IHF although we

406
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,779
still say it's not officially part of it

407
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,279
um it really is

408
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,360
um right which brings us to the pie

409
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,320
chart

410
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,839
um we have uh you know a number of

411
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,399
people from a number of places as usual

412
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,860
uh as usual in Europe or or near to

413
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,260
Europe I should say now I guess um

414
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,639
um quite a few participants from Europe

415
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,980
we have the usual mix uh between the USA

416
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,180
and others

417
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,519
um so that's pretty nice uh China is

418
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,440
still much lower unfortunately than it

419
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,880
used to be but it's ticking up I hear

420
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,440
it's getting easier for our Chinese

421
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,940
participants to travel that is really

422
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,260
good to see

423
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,820
um I think we're working on making it

424
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,160
easy for you to come to Yokohama there's

425
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,399
a way we're doing invitation letters or

426
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,440
the equivalent that you need to come and

427
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
I think there will be something in email

428
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,940
soon so please join us when we're closer

429
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,260
to you that'd be great

430
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,639
um this is the same pie chart split out

431
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,620
between on-site and remote

432
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,600
um it looks roughly similar the colors

433
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,300
are the same as previously and between

434
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,980
those two pie charts which confuse the

435
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,720
hell out of me in Vienna

436
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,579
um so it's it's roughly the same split

437
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,139
there's a few other sort of things you

438
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,420
noticeably see China is unsurprisingly

439
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,860
much more represented in the remote

440
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,240
attendance

441
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,100
um although time zones are not uh in

442
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,199
their favor here but that is really good

443
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,480
to see and I'm hoping that these 18 from

444
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,459
China are going to come back to be on

445
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,660
site very soon

446
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,339
covet cases we've had four

447
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,800
um so far we've been significantly worse

448
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,160
at this time of the week both in Vienna

449
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,540
and in Philadelphia so that makes us

450
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,919
really hopeful that we're going to have

451
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,579
a much lower number of reported cases

452
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,220
um this meeting then then last it sort

453
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,199
of seems to indicate that we're sort of

454
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,520
on the downswing of the pandemic which

455
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,380
is great it also means that you guys are

456
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,579
really good in general about wearing

457
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,500
your masks if one of us reminds you

458
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,540
don't feel bad right we get reminded too

459
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,400
it's just you don't see it

460
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,619
um we got to sort of watch each other a

461
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,780
little bit and if you um you know want

462
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,880
to provide feedback there's a survey

463
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,559
that Jay is going to send out after the

464
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,240
meeting and we're also going to consult

465
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,580
on what our masking and covert policy

466
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,460
should be going forward we changed it a

467
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,440
little bit coming to London

468
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,120
um Yokohama is going to have some

469
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,820
government restrictions in place I think

470
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,620
still today but it might change so we

471
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,940
have to have a conversation what people

472
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,100
are going to do there but I think the

473
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,039
general expectation would be that we try

474
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,799
to follow the rules that are you know

475
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,480
the local regulations at the place we're

476
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,820
going to over time it's a conversation

477
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,500
between you know the community and and

478
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,620
Leadership so please do send feedback

479
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,940
um there are free masks there are free

480
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,220
tests they are free aspirin and Tylenol

481
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,419
which are helpful even if you don't have

482
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:10,799
covet

483
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,419
um there's many other goodies that are

484
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,860
down in Secretariat area so if you need

485
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,360
something right

486
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,679
um so this whole like I don't have a

487
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,120
mask it doesn't really cut it because

488
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,679
they're everywhere and you can just grab

489
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,520
one

490
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,020
um so so please do

491
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,620
um

492
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,419
and there's three tests right and if you

493
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,460
do test positive we do ask that you

494
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,919
isolate an email the Secretariat there's

495
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,960
a support email at the bottom uh they'll

496
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,039
take care of you

497
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,120
um so you don't need to worry about

498
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,700
anything just you know please be in your

499
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,960
room for a bit and they'll tell you what

500
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,679
we want you to do

501
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,780
experiments we have not a lot

502
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,960
um there's the RFC 8989 nomcom

503
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,480
eligibility experiment uh that we

504
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,980
chartered the log working group for

505
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,640
which is trying to sort of Define new

506
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,640
eligibility criteria for the nomcom

507
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,039
because the old eligibility criteria

508
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,320
before the experiment restricted

509
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,179
themselves to only counting people that

510
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,460
were here in person and since we had a

511
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,840
bunch of meetings where nobody was in

512
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,760
person that wouldn't really have worked

513
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,020
if we wanted to have people on the

514
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,900
nomcom this now is charted to sort of

515
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,419
come up with a permanent replacement of

516
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,900
whatever the RFC was that RFC 8989 is an

517
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,160
experiment on

518
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,480
um and the expectation is that that

519
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,000
would sort of limit just before this

520
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,740
um it would finish hopefully reasonably

521
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,080
soon like in the next weeks or months at

522
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,160
the very latest

523
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,200
foreign

524
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,679
we had four isg announcements uh you got

525
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,539
them on ITF announced if you're

526
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,280
subscribed if not I encourage you to

527
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,020
subscribe to it

528
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,059
um we did

529
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,919
about zero appeals which is a nice thing

530
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,140
we did an isg statement Warren wants to

531
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,799
clap good job isg and good job Community

532
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,320
I guess uh we uh put out a statement on

533
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,780
restricting access to itfit systems the

534
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,400
summary is that

535
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,679
um we want to be transparent about what

536
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,780
the isg intends to do if the lawyers

537
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,220
come and say

538
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,900
um we have a case where we need to

539
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,640
basically stop somebody from accessing

540
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,520
the iitfit systems because they pose a

541
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,960
legal risk to the organization so

542
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,460
somebody's sharing like BitTorrent links

543
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,740
or you know

544
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,960
things like that so it needs to be a

545
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,880
significant legal risk to the

546
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,700
um to the ietf and the LLC is sort of

547
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,100
the home for that but the LLC decided

548
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,960
that the isg should really be the one

549
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,539
that's uh putting out the guidance here

550
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,460
because it obviously impacts the

551
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,559
standards process and so we put out a

552
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,120
statement and we basically had this

553
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,440
policy of what we're trying to do and

554
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,640
how we're going to communicate it and

555
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,260
and the intenders you know this will

556
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,240
never be used until the lawyers uh come

557
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,460
and say you really have to otherwise

558
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,320
it's going to be bad

559
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,360
and there's a lot more stuff at the link

560
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,100
into the data tracker that has a bunch

561
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,860
of written uh reports that we did and

562
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,299
there's a Blog that Greg is sort of

563
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,039
feeding with material if you have a

564
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,440
story for Greg that's ITF related

565
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,120
um Greg where are you can you raise your

566
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,820
hand he's there talk to him he's always

567
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,559
happy for Content

568
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,020
um and um he's going to feed our blog

569
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,580
and social media Channels with it so

570
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,020
that we are

571
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,340
becoming influencers

572
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,120
right

573
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,919
um this is a slide that originated with

574
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,419
genard which is my directorate that does

575
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,160
reviews for me and that I find really

576
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,620
useful and it's basically um janard

577
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,240
reminding me that they could use more

578
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,580
reviewers and and other area directors

579
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,260
when I said that said my directorate

580
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,780
could also use more reviewers so if you

581
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,880
want to become a reviewer talk to the

582
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,860
ads or if you know the person who runs

583
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,600
the director talk to them

584
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,039
um you don't have to have been around

585
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,960
for a long time generate specifically

586
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,480
you know it does general reviews where

587
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,799
people that are not familiar with the

588
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,600
technology read a document to sort of

589
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,580
Judge whether it is even understandable

590
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,100
for example right so so there's no

591
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,419
requirement that you need to have a Gray

592
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,740
beard I've been around for like two

593
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,000
decades

594
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,799
um so so please consider that you know

595
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,059
even if you're a new participant and you

596
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,320
want to maybe read something and I

597
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,820
actually hear that a lot of director

598
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,860
members value it because they get to see

599
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,419
stuff that they wouldn't see as part of

600
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,640
their regular idea participation and it

601
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,220
really sort of broadens up your horizon

602
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,600
um and there's some new directorates so

603
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,280
we're going to need some reviewers and

604
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,900
members for those two

605
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,159
um the one thing I want to mention is

606
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,780
you can actually in the data tracker

607
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,400
which we use for managing the reviews

608
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,559
say that you know I want to have you

609
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,600
know one assignment a quarter or a week

610
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,640
or you know I'm gonna be on vacation for

611
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,720
three months here so don't give me

612
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,880
anything so you can basically tell us or

613
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,320
tell the system what your load is and

614
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,580
that will be taken into account and

615
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,380
there's no hard feelings if you need to

616
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,760
go away for a bit because of day job or

617
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
other reasons so so please do consider

618
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,240
this

619
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,000
and finally um so um you might have

620
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,140
noticed when you're down in the

621
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,600
mezzanine uh is it mezzanine

622
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,880
there there are some kids there and

623
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,679
that's because we have daycare again we

624
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,000
had it in Vienna and we had it in

625
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,440
Philadelphia

626
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,900
so we are planning uh to provide child

627
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,840
care at all the 2023 meetings and I hear

628
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,880
probably going forward if the community

629
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,280
likes it and it seems so based on what I

630
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,500
heard and and sort of I'm putting this

631
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,539
here now because you know bringing kids

632
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:03,659
to a trip take some planning so you can

633
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:04,980
plan on this now

634
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,000
um like if you want to bring your kids

635
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,140
to Yokohama there's going to be child

636
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,000
care there I think the aspiration is

637
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,700
that it will be in English at least and

638
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,820
not just in Japanese I see some careful

639
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,620
nodding um

640
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,080
and it's also sort of available there's

641
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,940
some details on the web page or from a

642
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,400
for a pretty wide age range

643
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,080
um so so if you

644
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,520
um have kids and it would make it easier

645
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,080
for you to attend please do take

646
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,640
advantage of this

647
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,799
um we have dni diversity and inclusion

648
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,539
money that is specifically given to the

649
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,880
IHF to provide services like this

650
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,679
um so you using it is not going to cost

651
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,480
us anything additionally it's it's there

652
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,000
for for using it that's why we provide

653
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,860
it because we want to be able for people

654
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,440
to to come to us

655
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,059
I'm going to try and plan to use it in

656
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,440
Oklahoma but we'll see how that goes

657
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,679
because airfares are expensive

658
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,159
and that brings us to Miriam and the IAB

659
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,360
and her slides

660
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,960
I see you

661
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,020
show us yours

662
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,640
yeah and I will be very quick I only

663
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,020
have two slides because there's more

664
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,760
exciting stuff on the agenda but I still

665
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,980
wanted to come up here to show you my

666
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,539
face especially those people who might

667
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,460
not know me so

668
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,919
here I am and as I'm here I'm presenting

669
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,380
you to boring slides so the first slide

670
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,900
is we send a written report so if you're

671
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,880
actually interested in all the details

672
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,280
what the IAB is doing or not doing you

673
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,020
can read the report there's a link it's

674
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,080
in the proceedings the only two things I

675
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,059
wanted to mention here is the the recent

676
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,480
workshops so there was a workshop on

677
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,580
I'm starting with the second one here on

678
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,960
the slide so you know can get confused

679
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,159
there was a workshop on management

680
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,780
techniques and encrypted networks that

681
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,640
just happened recently

682
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,440
um you can find all the papers all the

683
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,960
slides and the recordings online and

684
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,460
there's a report to be written very soon

685
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,539
hopefully

686
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,240
and then there's a workshop coming up uh

687
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,919
very soon first week of December you

688
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,299
just missed the deadline I think it was

689
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,039
Monday

690
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,740
um about environmental impact so the

691
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,780
idea is to figure out how much impact

692
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,400
the internet as a whole has is there a

693
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,840
way to measure it and like make an

694
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,220
assessment and then understanding if

695
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,659
there's anything we need to do in that

696
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:13,799
space

697
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,559
so um these are two things that the IAB

698
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,700
is working on just to give you an

699
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,260
impression there's more in the report or

700
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,760
you can also talk to me or any IAB

701
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,658
member if you want to learn

702
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,700
and then my second slide is just I would

703
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,260
like to take the opportunity to say

704

now that you could do so immediately if

828
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,539
you want when you're bored here and

829
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:22,620
which is going to tell you a lot more

830
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,158
about it thanks

831
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,860
which is the page

832
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,580
okay okay hi

833
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,620
um

834
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,620
uh we did start late for a variety of

835
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,779
circumstances we think we'll end on time

836
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,539
and that came at the expense of pretty

837
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,340
much every step of the process

838
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,679
uh previously you had like six weeks to

839
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,899
do the questionnaire uh this time it was

840
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,240
2.14

841
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,220
right 15 days

842
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,080
um we're drilling interviews this week

843
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,919
as much as possible amap uh as Laura

844
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,960
said get your feedback in if you go to

845
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,520
the nomcom page

846
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,039
you'll see a link about it

847
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:05,700
um

848
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,039
or come see me I'm happy to take

849
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:12,240
in-person feedback and uh keep your let

850
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,399
your name be known or not as you prefer

851
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,399
had instances of both

852
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:20,100
uh so the isg asked me to I got a note

853
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,080
from them uh asking me to talk about

854
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,559
some of the technical hiccups that occur

855
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,000
look inside

856
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,100
um and reassure everyone I want to

857
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,659
reassure that there were some hiccups we

858
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,299
resolved them and just by coincidence

859
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,059
oops

860
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,799
sorry just by coincidence I happen to be

861
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,960
on almost every slate so I hope

862
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,000
everybody's reassured now

863
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,799
um more seriously as I said we got a

864
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,240
late start questionnaires weren't ready

865
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,399
some of the messages that went out to

866
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,399
the candidates was boy I really do it uh

867
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,440
was confusing because it said your

868
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,539
questionnaires below or in one place

869
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,860
that said your questionnaire is going to

870
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,480
be attached

871
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,100
um and

872
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,320
that'll be fixed in the data tracker in

873
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,779
a future release uh it is very hard to

874
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,659
test data tracker uh changes for nam-com

875
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,179
uh it doesn't happen very often on like

876
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,179
drafts and and that standard workflow

877
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:13,620
um

878
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,380
there was a new version of openssl

879
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,240
always a danger

880
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,299
um private key upload didn't work uh

881
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,340
until Robert and I got on a zoom zoom

882
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,260
call and he fixed it uh what that meant

883
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,640
is

884
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,039
every comment you sent to Nam com is

885
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,679
encrypted and the key to decrypted or

886
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,080
the key to decrypt the encryption key is

887
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,659
only shared among the nom-com members so

888
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,460
that nobody else can see you know when

889
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,080
we say your your information is

890
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,399
confidential including your

891
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,980
questionnaire responses

892
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,020
um that's also called Financial we

893
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,179
didn't lose any feedback

894
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:48,779
um

895
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,700
held you know held things in the

896
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,559
moderation queue until we got that all

897
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,020
fixed and we did some tests and it works

898
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,320
uh the flow from AMS to the data tracker

899
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,120
for the registrations getting people who

900
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,320
had registered and qualified

901
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,419
automatically entered uh that was a

902
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,880
manual process people may remember I

903
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,460
said oh we we've had like 12 more people

904
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,399
or 20 more people who qualified that's

905
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,519
going to now be automatic in the future

906
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,080
um there was an appeal when I had to

907
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,720
disqualify someone that added some delay

908
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,820
to the process oh this will be in the

909
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,860
report that you can not read at the end

910
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,299
of the next meeting

911
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:25,080
um

912
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,179
it was reasonable to make the the appeal

913
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,039
uh that also took some time we did have

914
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,140
a backup plan and so on uh there's

915
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,120
ambiguities in the RFC that controls the

916
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,000
nomination process 8713

917
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,159
um Errata or file to make sure all of

918
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,240
those things are cleared up in the

919
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,799
future

920
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,320
um some implications of that RFC also

921
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,880
weren't well documented like the

922
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,919
repeatability to process the format by

923
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,659
which the names come out the verify

924
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:55,320
verifiability of the voting volunteers

925
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,320
um we did end up with a verified process

926
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,960
at least three people verified

927
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,220
um and so on

928
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,919
uh I sent out several mails to

929
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,500
candidates warning them about the

930
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,960
deadline I was told that some people

931
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,460
never got the mails because they have a

932
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,580
filter that ignores their names on BCC

933
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,918
I don't think that's my fault

934
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,139
um I did also send out announce males to

935
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,119
iitf announce warning people about the

936
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,800
deadlines

937
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,659
and got a couple messages saying why are

938
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,639
you sending this spam to all of the ITF

939
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,580
so I guess you can't win uh there was

940
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,379
concern as I said feedback was lost if

941
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:35,040
that didn't happen uh male aliases and

942
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,399
SPF dkim do not interact very well with

943
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,339
mailing lists uh wow do they not

944
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,379
interact well at all so we had to

945
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,119
convert things from an alias to a

946
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,800
mailing list it's not archived and all

947
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,320
this but all that is handled now back to

948
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,480
the thing I really wanted to say

949
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,540
uh which is thanks to the people

950
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,820
um Robert Glenn Jennings Holland uh

951
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,800
Glenn from ASL

952
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,720
um could not do the job without them

953
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,180
they're amazing and

954
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,580
they full of energy and like do you need

955
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,020
this now do you need this today do you

956
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,820
need this tomorrow uh the voting

957
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,200
volunteers

958
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,980
um

959
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,339
it's well never mind being analogy

960
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,260
um people are really very dedicated we

961
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,640
had meetings where we went through the

962
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,579
questionnaires we had meetings video

963
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,160
meetings where we went through the list

964
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,660
of questions we would ask all the

965
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,920
nominees

966
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,780
um

967
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,280
lots of points were seriously considered

968
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,560
and there was very reasoned discussion

969
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,680
from across the voting volunteers

970
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,480
um and they are doing a really excellent

971
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,540
job listening to the interviews I try to

972
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,640
sit on as many as I can

973
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,560
um the discussions there and the

974
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,820
interviews are very thoughtful the

975
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,920
candidates for

976
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,960
the most part are giving very thoughtful

977
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,339
answers

978
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,920
um and finally the whole ITF community

979
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,740
having

980
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,540
been on the losing end of things

981
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,940
multiple times I know that one of the

982
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,400
things the I denominated committee takes

983
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,339
very seriously is community feedback so

984
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:08,220
please give us Community feedback thank

985
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,079

00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:44,700
how we measure our carbon emissions from

1084
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,339
meetings and to look at what forms of

1085
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:50,099
offsets we might do the plan is that for

1086

the meetings next year we'll be

1087

scheme

1089
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,220

to mitigate the effect of traveling um

1094
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,599

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,480
of us

1180
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,180
um I've lost roughly 28 pounds since

1181
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,680
that was taken so I've got a new one

1182
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,359
coming very shortly

1183
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,598
okay

1184
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,819
um and then finally so an option if you

1185
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:25,800
know that the way that our meetings work

1186
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,380
is that we have these companies who are

1187
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,599
a global hosts and Global supporters so

1188
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,400
they sign a long contract with us

1189
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,220
generally six or nine years they pay us

1190
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,680
a fee every year towards this

1191
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,240
um and then they get an opportunity to

1192
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,220
host a meeting with a host do the global

1193
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,540
supporters just pay us because they

1194
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,700
think it's the right thing to do we meet

1195
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,680
with these people at every meeting and

1196
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,119
we sit down and we talk to them we ask

1197
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:49,980
them what value are you getting from

1198
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,819
your

1199
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,440
um sponsorship you know what more could

1200
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,740

um we are with 119

1225
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,859

1226
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:54,180
and we'll be able to announce that quite

1227
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,980
soon that's an exciting one coming up

1228
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,680
and um with Europe

1229
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,380
um we are still arguing every day about

1230
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,359
what we think the particular issues with

1231
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,920
that one but we're very close hopefully

1232
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,020
to getting that one as well okay so we

1233
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,760
should have that full pipeline filled

1234
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,380
quite shortly and see where we go from

1235
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,560
there

1236
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,140
um so onto the intf endowment so for

1237
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,119
those of you who are not aware that we

1238
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,440
have an endowment

1239
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,599
um it was created to support the ITF and

1240
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,460
its activities for the long term to give

1241
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,560
us Financial Independence

1242
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,359
um so that we end up with a diversity of

1243
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,640
income while we have those companies

1244
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,260
that have sponsor us for our meetings

1245
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,760
while we have money from the internet

1246
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,319
Society

1247
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,160
um it all of this it relies on two or

1248
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,020
three small markets you know um

1249
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,300
preparative globally uh the domain name

1250
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,240
side from internet Society equip

1251
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,980
manufacturer and services

1252
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,260
um operators so we're looking to

1253
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,060
diversify income by receiving as much

1254
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,680
money as we can and having that as an

1255
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,000
investment enables us to continue

1256
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,220
throughout whatever may happen in the

1257
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,839
ups and downs coming

1258
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,520
um and there's I think a number of us

1259
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,540
are seeing it looks like there's a

1260
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,280
potential downcoming so this is what

1261
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,660
we're trying to do is prepare for these

1262
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,520
sort of things so if you'd like to

1263
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,160
donate you can do so there and we do

1264
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,260
make an effort to thank people who um

1265
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,880
very much who donate to that

1266
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,020
um so uh for the uh on the endowment

1267
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,420
um the internet Society have a special

1268
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,359
matching program that is lasting for

1269
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:27,660
um until 2027 I believe so that

1270
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,359
um if uh any money that we get is

1271
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:32,040
matched two to one initially and then

1272
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,900
we've matched it one to one initially so

1273
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,760
Now's the Time to give us money because

1274
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,079
it's very much

1275
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:38,760
um matched

1276
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,319
um and

1277
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,660

00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,200
so on and we had a number of other

1321
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,520
standards Dev and other industry orgs

1322
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,020
reach out and say that they thought that

1323
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,700
was interesting and you know informed

1324
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,319
some of the things they were doing

1325
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:34,079
uh but we continue to discuss what the

1326
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,599
future meeting approaches may be and you

1327
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:38,819
know how that will be evolving and as

1328
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:40,500
Jay mentioned that'll be the subject of

1329
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,420
some of the survey questions that follow

1330
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,339
this meeting

1331
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,960
um and also as Jay mentioned we continue

1332
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,780
to focus on fundraising progress we've

1333
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,579
got this wonderful matching program

1334
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:52,380
right now and we are really doing our

1335
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,900
best to try to encourage donors and

1336
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,800
these take a long time to cultivate

1337
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,020
um and folks that are usually willing to

1338
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,359
write checks of that size you know don't

1339
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,460
do it um you know at the spur of the

1340
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,900
moment they give it quite a lot of

1341
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,819
thought which you'd expect but we've got

1342
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:10,920
a great matching program just to keep

1343
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,339
banging that drum so looking for uh for

1344
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:17,460
some progress there and um thankfully

1345
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,859
with the ietf trust Glenn does not have

1346
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:22,680
coveted this meeting so um we are having

1347
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,720
an advantage now that we're back in

1348
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,980
person to have a joint meeting between

1349
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,440
the trust and the LLC and in particular

1350
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,420
since they are moving into this new

1351
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,880
corporate structure uh talking about how

1352
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,619
we can better support them you know what

1353
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:36,000
funding needs they have for next year

1354
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,500
and so on

1355
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,839
um so that's uh continuing of course

1356
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,300
we're in the midst of 2023 budgeting and

1357
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,099
you'll hear more about that at some

1358
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:45,359
point soon

1359
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,579
um and you know as we lock down that

1360
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:49,440
budget and then of course there's some

1361
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,240
you know more um

1362
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,920
you know higher level long-term

1363
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,980
questions we always continue focusing on

1364
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,319
things like are there gaps that emerge

1365
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,260
you know post-isoc spin-off we did the I

1366
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,839
asset to retrospective last year or

1367
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,760
earlier this year maybe it was we

1368
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,920
continue to look at things if there are

1369
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,440
gaps and how do we fill them but really

1370
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,599
the bigger questions are are sort of

1371
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:14,280
these last three and they all group

1372
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,319
together you know what's the new normal

1373
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,300
for hybrid meeting attendance numbers

1374
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,460
and how do we adapt and that really

1375
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,740
means how do the contracts for venues

1376
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,440
adapt and what sort of room size

1377
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,359
commitments or block commitments are

1378
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,980
there and what do the cost implications

1379
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,060
look like

1380
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,920
you know what are the potential

1381
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,260
cancellation fees for changes or

1382
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,260
reductions if there are you know further

1383
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,240
um you know spikes in the virus and so

1384
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,440
on

1385
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,940
um and so those are the questions that I

1386
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,160
think we're we're all um trying to think

1387
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,780
about and they do have cost implications

1388
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,700
which we'll see

1389
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,740
um uh shortly

1390
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,079
um so here are the implications of some

1391
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,300
of those things so putting aside for a

1392
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,200
moment which I'll come back to

1393
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,180
Investments the on-site meeting

1394
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,099
registrations were much lower than

1395
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:02,460
forecast for this year and I think if we

1396
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,880
go back to one year ago from now nobody

1397
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,140
really knew what was going to happen

1398
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,940
with covid we had to make some educated

1399
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,460
guesses and some of those guesses you

1400
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,839
know were not as

1401
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:14,579
um you know close to what the reality

1402
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:16,859
ended up being but of course if any of

1403
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:18,300
us were really great with you know

1404
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,160
forecasting what would happen with covid

1405
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,680
we probably you know would have made

1406
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,660
other you know investment decisions and

1407
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,140
and uh you know uh what have you so that

1408
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,420
was I think the Big Challenge and um

1409
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,200
we're trying to I think look forward to

1410
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,880
next year and the years beyond that

1411
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,140
particularly of the years that we're

1412
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,839
signing venue contracts for you know

1413
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,760
what does that mean about room block

1414
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,800
sizes and

1415
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,480
um and other sort of commitments that go

1416
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,040
along with that so we'll see what

1417
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,220
happens and it'll be really interesting

1418
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,200
to see the next few years as Lars

1419
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,579
pointed out really good numbers this

1420
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:56,819
meeting that was a relief for us but

1421
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:59,040
we'll see what happens and of course in

1422
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,980
terms of um you know Investments you

1423
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,540
know we're not looking to sell any

1424
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,880
investments in the near-term

1425
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,160
um and so uh you know these are just

1426
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,800
sort of paper uh changes but obviously

1427
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,680
the the global stock markets have had

1428
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,380
some challenges lately What with um you

1429
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,280
know a war conflict in Ukraine and so on

1430
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,220
so we'll see what happens hopefully uh

1431
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,079
you know world economies take a turn for

1432
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,700
the better but it does look like

1433
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,460
certainly the winter will be a tough

1434
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,599
time in the next few months

1435
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:34,559
and then lots of ways that you can

1436
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,020
contact us don't hesitate to reach out

1437
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,220

1438
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,500
and that's all for the LLC portion thank

1439
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,619
you

1440
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,339
thank you and the LLC will be back on

1441
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:49,319
stage later for Open Mic

1442
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:50,460
um and uh

1443
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,480
I'm going to talk a little bit about

1444
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,780
Alexis Rossi the new risky uh coming to

1445
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,339
this stage

1446
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,079
um to introduce ourselves so so

1447
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,640
um as you know we had this restructuring

1448
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,920
of the RFC editor process

1449
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,020
um and with that came came a new uh

1450
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,880
position and a new title and a new hire

1451
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,260
and that is Alexis welcome

1452
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,079
hi everybody I'm really loving this

1453
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:14,640
risky thing because it goes very well

1454
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,440
risky Rossi

1455
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,819
um and I think everyone else is going to

1456
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,819
have to live up to that after me uh were

1457
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:23,520
you as risky as the risky Rossi

1458
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,380
um let's try to say that three times

1459
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,780
fast so I thought I would say just a

1460
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,579
little bit about my background and who I

1461
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:32,579
am so you can kind of get to know me

1462
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:35,520
um I've started out as a cookbook editor

1463
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,980
way back in the day and then fell in

1464
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,359
love with the internet

1465
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,520
um and joined a place called clarinet

1466
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,680
back in 1996 that was one of the first

1467
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,319
news aggregators on the net old enough

1468
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,240
that uh it was still being published in

1469
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,339
Usenet news groups

1470
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:52,920
um and then eventually kind of worked my

1471
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,319
way through a couple of other things and

1472
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,300
ended up at the internet archive which

1473
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,700
is a digital library

1474
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,079
um non-profit that you can get to at

1475
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,180
archive.org and the thing that most

1476
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,160
people know them for is the Wayback

1477
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,900
machine

1478
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,119
um so at the archive I've been there for

1479
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,559
about 20 years

1480
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,940
um and I'm still there in a part-time

1481
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,640
capacity uh at the archive life

1482
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,040
originated a website that is supposed to

1483
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,900
have one web page for every book ever

1484
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,240
published which is called

1485
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,980
openlibrary.org I ran the Wayback

1486
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,040
machine for uh I don't know four or five

1487
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,800
years something like that I'm in there

1488
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,319
somewhere I went to library school

1489
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:32,760
um and now I'm kind of the head

1490
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,200
librarian for all of the media

1491
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,420
collections there so that's television

1492
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,640
and radio and podcasts and movies and

1493
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,339
audio and software uh if you have any

1494
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:43,200
questions about any of that I'm always

1495
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,880
happy to talk about it because I'm still

1496
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,319
there and I'm I'm like their favorite

1497
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,180
mouthpiece

1498
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,640
um so starting here

1499
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,140
um I'm trying to bring some of that

1500
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,480
archival and library and editorial

1501
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,540
experience into this new role

1502
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,040
um that I think is still kind of a

1503
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,839
little bit ill-defined and we're still

1504
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,520
sort of trying to figure out what that

1505
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,660
role means now uh under the new editor

1506
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,059
model so the things I'm starting with

1507
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,880
the things I'm working on currently are

1508
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,640
an are uh revamp of the RFC uh Dash uh

1509
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,640
editor.org website uh that's just in its

1510
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,619
infancies if you have any feedback you'd

1511
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,859
like to provide about that let me know

1512
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:28,859
um I I have sent out a document to a

1513
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,599
small number of people and that will be

1514
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,400
continuing as we go through the research

1515
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,520
phase and you'll be asked for more input

1516
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,339
um also uh working on our archival

1517
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:40,140
agreements making sure that there are

1518
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,119
full copies of the rfcs that you all

1519
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,640
work so hard on in other institutions

1520
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,079
and that's something that we do for

1521
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,900
archival safe keeping uh and getting a

1522
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,020
couple more of those set up uh so

1523
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,480
basically that's where we are right now

1524
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,760
and I've only been doing this for about

1525

thank you and I'm very happy I think

1540
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,599
we've been with a very good good hire

1541
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,440
here

1542
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,140
um and uh your acronym is way cooler

1543
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,480
than Olaf's acronym was when he was the

1544
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,480
acting RFC serious editor I'll let you

1545
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,359
contract that on your own so thank you

1546
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,460
very much Alexis for saying hi

1547
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,800
um Glenn is up with the trust uh take it

1548
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,920
away

1549
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,480
and I'm the IHF trust chair now Covet

1550
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,660
free uh

1551
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,099
so uh I'm gonna start off by saying I'm

1552
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:12,960
going to take a challenge the IAB said

1553
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,599
their slides were the most boring

1554
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,359
challenge accepted I'm about to talk to

1555
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:21,059
a bunch of engineering experts about

1556
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:24,000
trust stuff which is all legal things so

1557
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,619
I think this may be the most boring of

1558
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,740
all

1559
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,059
so the first that I'd like to point out

1560
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:31,800
is the trustee is made up of five

1561
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,140
trustees they're appointed three of them

1562
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,839
from the non-com one from the isg and

1563
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:39,359
one from the isoc Board of Trustees

1564
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,720
uh I'm the chair Kathleen Moriarty who

1565
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,780
couldn't be here for this IHF is the

1566
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,880
treasurer Joel helper he's around so if

1567
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,520
you see him in the Halls say hi Stephan

1568
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,760
Wagner is also here I don't trustees and

1569
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,040
Victor hersing he is a trustee I think

1570
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,300
he's around I saw him yesterday

1571
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,839
so he if you don't know what the its

1572
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,119
trust does don't feel bad

1573
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,040
when I first started coming to the ITF

1574
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,579
uh many years ago I would come to the

1575
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:13,380
plenary and the Trustmark can come up

1576
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,059
and talk about what the trusts had done

1577
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:17,160
that time and they would often say we

1578
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,380
haven't been sued by anybody recently

1579
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,420
and that was awesome but I didn't quite

1580
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,339
ever understand really why and I didn't

1581
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:26,099
understand what the trust did and then I

1582
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:28,680
somehow found myself as a trustee and I

1583
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,240
somehow found myself eventually his

1584
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,099
chair and I guess I had to figure it out

1585
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:33,900
so let me try to impart a little bit of

1586
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,700
what I learned along the journey

1587
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:41,599
the trust manages IP assets for the ITF

1588
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,819
and why that's important is that the

1589
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:46,980
standards development process generates

1590
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,559
a lot of stuff uh the contributions that

1591
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,640
we all make and that we're all making

1592
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,799
today sitting in this room uh the

1593
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,359
photographs being taken the video being

1594
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:55,859
taken and the comments of the microphone

1595
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:58,380
are all contributions to the IHF Trust

1596
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,059
and to the ITF

1597
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:02,940
and so ultimately the ITF trust takes

1598
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,319
care of managing and protecting these

1599
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,720
various things for the community and so

1600
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,859
there's a list of the things right there

1601
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:09,780
it's a bunch of software licenses it's

1602
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,760
like

1603
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,380
copyrights on photographs and that kind

1604
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,240
of stuff but it's important and it

1605
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,720
enables the ITF to function

1606
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,460
this is sort of the big picture of how

1607
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,280
it helps the ITF develop standards

1608
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,020
so you know we all come together and we

1609
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,760
write drafts and we make comments on

1610
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,319
microphones those are all ITF

1611
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:29,400
contributions

1612
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,160
and those are going to two places one of

1613
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,720
them goes into the ITF itself right goes

1614
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,980
into all of us we sit in our meeting

1615
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,319
rooms we work on our our various working

1616
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:38,460
groups

1617
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,260
those contributions go in there the

1618
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,599
ideas go in there the thoughts right the

1619
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:44,339
things we make

1620
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:45,900
there's another part that a lot of

1621
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,460
people kind of sort of go yes to and

1622
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,079
don't really understand which is the

1623
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:52,880
rights that are granted under RFC 5378

1624
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,400
those uh grants are what enable the rest

1625
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,500
of the process actually happen because

1626
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,180
if you hadn't noticed you also didn't

1627
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,799
need to go off and sign up a lot of

1628
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,299
documentation with your lawyers before

1629
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,559
you come into the room and hang out with

1630
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,280
everybody

1631
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,200
that's because the ITF trust was created

1632
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,480
and the whole way it integrates with the

1633
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,980
development process is really elegant

1634
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,480
and you got to read the documentation

1635
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,940
and the rfcs that set it up to really

1636
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,619
these things are beautiful they were

1637
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:21,480
done back in 2005 but in short the trust

1638
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,460
takes care of those granted rights it

1639
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,980
tells the ITF yep we got this stuff go

1640
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,000
ahead and use it in your development

1641
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,900
process

1642
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,720
the IHF goes off and creates rfcs which

1643
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,420
it publishes and then it goes I test

1644
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,280
trust here is the copyrights on all

1645
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,260
those rfcs we've produced we take that

1646
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,579
and we license it to the entire world

1647
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:41,579
and we we don't charge a fee uh we

1648
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:42,780
really don't charge a fee to anybody for

1649
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,880
any of this stuff but we say world come

1650
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,220
and use the stuff the ITF produced the

1651
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,380
contributions the rfcs all that kind of

1652
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,540
stuff and it's really easy click here

1653
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,480
read it go ahead and go go work and it's

1654
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,920
a really powerful process and I'm very

1655
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,480
proud to be part of

1656
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,220
um that part of the process that help

1657
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,720
enable it because the idea is really

1658
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,899
cool

1659
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,980

representation uh thank you been a lot

1671
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,400
rest of the ITF uh thank you Brad and

1672
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,680
Victor's in particular uh they really

1673
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,660
helped uh during that I asked the two

1674
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:42,240
transition to handle updating the trust

1675
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,339
documents and a lot of the software

1676
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:46,380
licenses or sorry not softwise but the

1677
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,579
copyright licenses and all the stuff

1678
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,619
that you used for these things like

1679
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:52,079
protocol advantages they just wrote so

1680
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,780
thank you uh and we now have a new

1681
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,359
representation uh Andy upper Grove from

1682
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,859
gessemer up the Grove will be

1683
01:01:58,859 --> 01:02:01,500
representing the trusts as our lawyer

1684
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,819
going forward

1685
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:06,180
oh there's a couple other things here

1686
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,540
we had a report where there's a an error

1687
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:12,900
in the uh trust FAQs on our website and

1688
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,400
so we took that in we took a look at it

1689
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,400
and gosh they were right

1690
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,920
what had happened was at some point uh

1691
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,920
two RFC references had got swapped and

1692
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,059
it would be way too hard to explain

1693
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:25,859
which one went where so what we

1694
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:27,900
typically did was we put up an FAQ

1695
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,940
update on our announcement page and it

1696
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,260
has both texts and you can go there and

1697
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,940
see which one got swapped up for the

1698
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,240
other one

1699
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,618
so let's skip a page

1700
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,480
um one of the things we've been doing is

1701
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,420
uh restructuring the ITF trust from a

1702
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,579
Virginia trust over into a

1703
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:50,579
not-for-profit corporation uh the this

1704
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:52,440
has largely been done because there's

1705
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,440
been some problems emerge in the trust

1706
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,660
operating one of the big problems was

1707
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,180
that insurance that we have to carry on

1708
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,440
our trustees because if you're a trustee

1709
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,599
you carry a lot of personal liability uh

1710
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,339
because you literally are signing up to

1711
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:07,500
have great your legal responsibility for

1712
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,720
these assets you carry a lot of legal

1713
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,760
you know liability around you and so we

1714
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,440
carry Insurance on everybody the trouble

1715
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,660
is we can't increase that amount of

1716
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,980
insurance the marketplace is very

1717
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,260
difficult for trust to get insurance and

1718
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,119
so after some analysis we said well one

1719
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,099
way to solve that is to convert trustees

1720
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:25,740
from trustees to directors on a board of

1721
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,900
a corporation they're both not for not

1722
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,000
for profits trust us currently the new

1723
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,940
one will be true uh but this is a huge

1724
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,260
problem and it was a lot of people said

1725
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,880
I won't be a trustee because of that

1726
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,799
liability and a lot of Trustees worry

1727
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:39,119
about this

1728
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,220
that's work that's continuing to 2023

1729
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,420
I'll show you another slide where we're

1730
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:43,680
at right now

1731
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,180
uh if you want to find a more

1732
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,799
information about this stuff and the

1733
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,299
consultation process we went through it

1734
01:03:48,299 --> 01:03:49,619
was about two month thing we did earlier

1735
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:51,299
this year you go to the trustee website

1736
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:52,680
and there's videos and stuff like that

1737
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,780
you can see the whole thing play out uh

1738
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,579
discussions and how we work through it

1739
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,440
and thought through the process

1740
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,839
uh One update when we did that process

1741
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:03,599
we had been told by the state of

1742
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,220
Delaware that they were totally cool

1743
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,260
with us calling the new Corporation the

1744
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,440
ITF trust which we thought okay it's a

1745
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,520
trust that's going to be a corporation

1746
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,319
that can be a little confusing that's

1747
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:15,839
why we asked permission up front when we

1748
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,460
actually went and found that Articles of

1749
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,440
Incorporation they came back and said

1750
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,420
what that's crazy you can't have a

1751
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,859
corporation it's a trust those are two

1752
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,559
different things so we have oh okay well

1753
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:28,500
we did ask you but all right so uh We've

1754
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,720
chosen a new name it's actually uh

1755
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,119
called the ITF intellectual property

1756
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,280
management Corporation I try to get just

1757
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,740
call it you know ITF IP but people

1758
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,640
thought there might be a little

1759
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,900
confusion with itfip and IP I don't know

1760
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,520
um maybe you know we kind of called the

1761
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,859
v-necks I don't know anyhow so that

1762
01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:48,359
thing but

1763
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:49,740
the way we're going to thread this

1764
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,839
needle is we're going to take the we

1765
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,240
have taken the name ITF trust and

1766
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,839
Blended them back in to the uh bylaws

1767
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,339
and the other materials are on the

1768
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:01,079
corporation and so what's going to

1769
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:02,520
really happen is that we as the

1770
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,140
community can continue calling us the

1771
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,540
ITF trust the documentation we have will

1772
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,819
refer to it and even the a corporate

1773
01:05:08,819 --> 01:05:11,579
article material will refer to it says

1774
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:13,799
the IHF trust also known as this other

1775
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:15,180
thing so we're never really going to

1776
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,040
call it this name amongst flight company

1777
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,359
we're always going to be able to trust

1778
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,440
so this is where we're at in the process

1779
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,319
we did the community consultation back

1780
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:28,140
in between May and July we decided to go

1781
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,640
proceed forward

1782
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,299
we filed uh the paperwork to go off and

1783
01:05:33,299 --> 01:05:38,220
do it that was done just after itf1 14.

1784
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,660
so the next thing that's happening right

1785
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,359
now is we're finalizing this corporate

1786
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:44,520
spinning up we're dealing with things

1787
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,440
like hey you can't call yourself the IHF

1788
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,640
trust Corporation because that's too

1789
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,859
confusing but we're hopeful it's going

1790
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:51,480
to get done very soon and right after

1791
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,619
that what we're going to do next is

1792
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:56,819
apply for the IRS 501c3 SAS which if

1793
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,280
you're familiar with IRS tax law which

1794
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,260
is an awesome thing to play you know

1795
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,760
hanging around in

1796
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,099
um that gets us our not-for-profit

1797
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:07,680
status once that is approved the next

1798
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,940
thing is all are going to happen in

1799
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,020
parallel we're going to take the assets

1800
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,280
from the old thing give them a little

1801
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,520
thing and say job well done

1818
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:51,559
you mm-hmm

1819
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,299
thank you Glenn and I will point out

1820
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:55,680
that if you remember this overview slide

1821
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,539
it has the arrow going from the trust to

1822
01:06:57,539 --> 01:06:59,099
the planet

1823
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,780
um there's no dollar sign attached to

1824
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,099
that and that is one of the things that

1825
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:03,420
makes it unique groups we license this

1826
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,859
stuff out freely and widely because we

1827
01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:06,240
want to be our stuff to be used by

1828
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,740
everybody right

1829
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:09,240
um since we're amongst friends here I

1830
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,500
will point out in the eye to you there's

1831
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,940
an error going back from the planet to

1832
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,859
the itu that I think has 30 million

1833
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:15,480
dollars on it or something like that so

1834
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,539
just you know we if you if you wonder

1835
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:20,460
why Jay is asking for money that that's

1836
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,500
one of the reasons because we don't have

1837
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,000
that Arrow from the planet coming our

1838
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,400
way quite as boldly as some other

1839
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,960
organizations do

1840
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,299
right which brings us to the iitf-116

things has been changed uh from the

1886

previous Yokohama meeting so the but the

1887
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:40,080
meetings venue will be the uh the past

1888
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,198
new Pacific Conference Hall that is

1889
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,839
called the Pacific North there is no

1890
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,899
sentence of

1891
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:52,140
the old Pacific meeting space so that is

1892
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,819
a very nice space

1893
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:57,780
and the the next time the is this screen

1894
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,179
the last time there was the November but

1895
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:03,600
uh this time uh it is our spring so it's

1896
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,060
very good season for the achieve Rossum

1897
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,920
so I think you can enjoy the cherry

1898
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,140
blossom there of course as well as your

1899
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,660

1900
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,040
so

1901
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,679
um and the uh as mentioned by the last

1902
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:20,520
uh we have several restrictions we still

1903
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,260
have several risk restrictions for the

1904
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:26,159
entry to Japan but the uh the uh the

1905
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,219

please we're gonna share the information

1909
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,140
later before the meeting but I think the

1910
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,440
only match you can enter to Japan easily

1911
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,179

1912
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:48,540
and uh yeah so

1913
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,540

01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,540
during the time when John was still

1940
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,340
there in the corner of his on the 11th

1941
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,560
floor I want to say and it was really at

1942
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,320
the time I didn't quite you know it was

1943
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,000
John he was always there you know he was

1944
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,760
excellent but it's sort of only after a

1945
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,080
certain number of years do you realize

1946
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,420
how impactful he really was and so an

1947
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:11,400
award was created in his name to honor

1948
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,100

the development of the internet and the

1970
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:04,679
and the deployment of the internet all

1971

am very pleased to present this award to

1986
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,340
George Sadowski who is here with us

1987
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,670
tonight George has

1988
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:50,880
[Applause]

1989
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,239
George has a very long history on on the

1990
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,340
internet and in uh in working with the

1991
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,080
internet but a particular note that I

1992
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,659
want to uh I want to raise here are his

1993
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:03,480
contributions to the um to the

1994
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,800
development of the internet around the

1995
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,080
world connectivity and in particular the

1996
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:10,440
development of the inet program at uh

1997
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,239
that what which was a sponsor by the

1998
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,739
internet Society early in the internet

1999
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:16,140
society's life so um George I would like

2000
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:18,120
to invite you to come up and say a few

2001
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,219
words while George is coming up I will

2002
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:23,940
say normally we present um also a shiny

2003
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:26,040
um Crystal globe and so on and there's a

2004
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,380
monetary award that goes with this but

2005
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,300
um George lives not very far from our

2006
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,600
office in in Reston and it seemed like

2007
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,760
the worst example of trombone routing to

2008
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,199
bring it here in order to get him to

2009
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,420
take it back home so we thought that we

2010
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,760
would forego that um this time so George

2011
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,320
thank you so much

2012
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,900
congratulations

2013
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:51,580
[Applause]

2014
01:14:56,239 --> 01:15:00,179
okay I don't uh thank you very much I'm

2015
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:02,699
really honored by this award and even

2016
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:05,760
the more so that it was Joe I was chosen

2017
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,739
on the basis of my relationship with my

2018
01:15:07,739 --> 01:15:09,659
peers and their assessment of

2019
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:12,719
contributions but I think it's important

2020
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:15,360
to note that these workshops would not

2021
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,580
have been possible had it not been for

2022
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,219
many other volunteers we had about the

2023
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:23,159
workshops ran for 10 years and we had

2024
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:26,040
about 15 to 30 volunteers teaching

2025
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,520
administering Logistics etc for each

2026
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,640
year these people gave up two to three

2027
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,980
weeks and maybe more of their lives they

2028
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:37,020
developed curricula offline they did a

2029
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,820
number of other things offline they

2030
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:41,640
looked at student applications Etc and

2031
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,300
uh actually there may be some volunteers

2032
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,300
here I don't know the person I can think

2033
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,699
of is her Andy Bush who may be here or

2034
01:15:50,699 --> 01:15:52,500
may not be I don't know

2035
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,199
um just to as a historical note it's

2036
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:58,860
worth uh remembering that in 1992 when

2037
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:02,600
the first Workshop was being conducted

2038
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,940
Randy was run running connectivity to

2039
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,620
several African countries through

2040
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:11,040
various 64 KB leased lines that

2041
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,719
terminated in his bedroom in Portland

2042
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,600
Oregon and then were connected to the

2043
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,580
internet

2044
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:19,380
that was the State of Affairs and one of

2045
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,940
the tracks we did took what we taught

2046
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:24,000
was how to connect your com your your

2047
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,239
country to the internet and one of the

2048
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:29,280
ways which was used was a protocol which

2049
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,440
I'm sure doesn't exist anymore slip

2050
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,679
which allowed dial-up uh uh connections

2051
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:36,840
to the internet this was the situation

2052
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,820
we were faced with and that was a time

2053
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:41,699
when digital bits went over analog lines

2054
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:44,100
and they're owned by telephone companies

2055
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,320
which the situation which is totally

2056
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,580
reversed today

2057
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:50,640
so so those people deserve a lot of

2058
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,239
credit so why did we do this uh we

2059
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,219
didn't conceptualize it quite at this

2060
01:16:56,219 --> 01:16:58,739
time quite like this at the time but but

2061
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,800
I think several of us Randy for sure I

2062
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,159
also had had experience with the working

2063
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:06,600
in developing countries and doing

2064
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,340
technology transfer

2065
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,140
and when you went into a developing

2066
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,600
country and I would always go to the

2067
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,699
university to see what kind of Technical

2068
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:16,739
Resources there were the University

2069
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:19,199
Library could often be fit in one room

2070
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:22,500
much much smaller than this room and the

2071
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,020
technical books might fit on two

2072
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,540
bookshelves and the networking and

2073
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:31,500
Computing bits might fit on one shelf or

2074
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:35,940
less so there was clearly a lack of

2075
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:38,340
information about developments and a

2076
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,179
lack of communication with colleagues

2077
01:17:41,179 --> 01:17:43,860
we saw

2078
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,179
excuse me

2079
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:45,840
um

2080
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,260
we saw evidence that there were problems

2081
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,179
that these people were facing in all

2082
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:53,219
countries and not only in the technology

2083
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:56,699
in in agricultural in Industry Etc and

2084
01:17:56,699 --> 01:17:58,500
uh one of the definitions of information

2085
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,300
poverty is

2086
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,920
um you know you have a problem in these

2087
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,679
countries uh and you don't understand

2088
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:06,900
what exactly what kind of a problem it

2089
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,000
is you don't know whether the problem

2090
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,080
has it is being met by anybody else in

2091
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,600
any other place you don't know how to

2092
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,960
find out uh you can't find out even if

2093
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,820
you knew you probably couldn't

2094
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:24,120
communicate with them because the uh you

2095
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,340
could use postal mail or you could use

2096
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:30,300
telx 75 to 110 bits per second that was

2097
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,820
the original uh email

2098
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:35,400
and uh even if you knew who they were

2099
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,739
you couldn't contact them and you didn't

2100
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:39,420
have a way of getting the information

2101
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:43,080
you needed and even getting the uh the

2102
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,940
confidence that you that your problem

2103
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:47,940
had a solution you could find it so uh

2104
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:50,040
we saw this we saw the internet the

2105
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,320
emergence of the internet as a way of

2106
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,060
breaking down those communication

2107
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:57,659
barriers and that was the motivation and

2108
01:18:57,659 --> 01:19:01,440
by god it worked uh the uh

2109
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,159
the results were we had about 1500

2110
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:07,140
participants from almost all developing

2111
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,940
countries we did not succeed in getting

2112
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:11,400
anybody from North Korea

2113
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,199
and I'm sure we missed some of the

2114
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,940
smaller Island countries in the Pacific

2115
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,280
but by and large we got people from all

2116
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,460
over the world uh even the uh especially

2117
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,800
the Russian uh former the former Soviet

2118
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,320
Union countries George Soros contributed

2119
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,880
a lot uh to us to uh to make that happen

2120
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,840
uh we developed world leaders in Telecom

2121
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,179
and in the internet we I think there are

2122
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:38,480
four of our students became Ministers of

2123
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,000
communication and information technology

2124
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,280
uh two of them uh uh well one of them

2125
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,040
Tara camel in Egypt was a major force in

2126
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,320
developing the internet in Africa uh

2127
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:53,100
Nick weiner from Ghana uh an equally uh

2128
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,140
powerful force tariq's no longer with us

2129
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:58,800
but he is working today uh and he didn't

2130
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,659
become a minister because he thought it

2131
01:20:00,659 --> 01:20:02,820
was probably better for him to stay with

2132
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:05,460
his own company he was asked uh to

2133
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:08,460
become one and he turned it down uh

2134
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,520
there are also uh people in the private

2135
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,900
sector in ngos uh who were leaders now

2136
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:18,900
in their countries but were our students

2137
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,440
and they developed a network early on a

2138
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,600
network of email which as soon as they

2139
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,719
could have it uh by which they reinforce

2140
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:30,480
their own concerns and solve problems in

2141
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,000
that email Network grew very

2142
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,500
substantially over the course of the

2143
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,940
workshops

2144
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:39,900
um so isoc played a critical role in

2145
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:44,520
that the idea came in 1992 in Kobe I

2146
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,679
remember going to land Larry Larry

2147
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:49,560
landweber and saying look we can do this

2148
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,560
uh we can we can develop this we can get

2149
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,480
people we can train them we can send

2150
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,880
them back and it was an ill-formed

2151
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,820
concept it had no uh guarantees of

2152
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:02,340
success Larry said here's fifty thousand

2153
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,920
dollars you raise the rest and uh do it

2154
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:08,340
and we did it and uh the result of that

2155
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,440
success we continued for the next eight

2156
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,360
or nine years

2157
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,820
they um the internet Society quickly

2158
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:18,120
took the program under its own Aegis and

2159
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,620
provided the support and the

2160
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:22,020
encouragement and the backing that was

2161
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:25,500
required for us to continue in 1992

2162
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,420
there was almost no place that you could

2163
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,460
go in the world to get formal training

2164
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,500
in internet if you were in a developing

2165
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,199
country we phased out the workshops in

2166
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:36,780
2001 when there had been enough critical

2167
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,360
mass formed in the regions and in a lot

2168
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,520
of the countries so that they were no

2169
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,960
longer necessary

2170
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,300
so this was um one of the more important

2171
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,400
things that I've done in my life I think

2172
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,640
uh and I really am glad I did it thank

2173
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,060
you very much

2174
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:58,140
okay

2175
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:05,580
thank you George this is very well

2176
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:08,520
deserved and and I I think the sort of

2177
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,600
spirit from the early days of the

2178
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,699
Internet it's still around right sort of

2179
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:14,280
um just sort of doing creative things to

2180
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,659
solve problems to bring people together

2181
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:18,360
and and thinking broadly and and just

2182
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,000
bringing different people in is I think

2183
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,800
what's still around and it's good as it

2184
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,060
is

2185
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,880
right which brings me to another slide

2186
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,719
that has Georgia on it

2187
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,500
he said you said you didn't have any I

2188
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,840
guess it was Andrew's anyway this is a

2189
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,100
very nice photo of you though by the way

2190
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,320
I'm glad we get to show it

2191
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,659
um and that brings us to the IAB Open

2192
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:40,739
Mic

2193
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:42,420
um so if you're an IB member and if

2194
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,400
you're here please come up

2195
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,500
let's see miria I see some others and if

2196
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,719
you have a question for the IAB

2197
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:50,460
um there's a QR code if you could scan

2198
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,080
it so that we can put you into the

2199
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,760
virtual queue if you're remote and if

2200
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,380
you want to ask a question to the IB or

2201
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,960
any of the other open mics later on you

2202
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,179
know you can get into the queue and then

2203
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:02,520
we will uh call you and ask you to

2204
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,560
unmute and show us your video if you

2205
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,340
like

2206
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,260
and so far the queue is empty and mirror

2207
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,719
is going to take over

2208
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:12,380
hi again

2209
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,219
and

2210
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:16,920
a round of interactive

2211
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,580
can see everybody on the sites

2212
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,840
um but

2213
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,060
we'll keep the mask on in good tradition

2214
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,340
here so if you actually want to see more

2215
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:28,500
of the IV without mask the full face you

2216
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,580
have to ask some questions because

2217
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,860
that's the occasion where you take off

2218
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:33,719
the mask but we do a round of

2219
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:35,880
introductions we start with you David uh

2220
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,600

and unfortunately we have uh well we're

2231
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,060
missing two people who are only remote

2232
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,340
or not not only glad to have you here

2233
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:30,080
Tommy introduce yourself please

2234
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:33,900
hello Tommy Polly ivy

2235
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,340
and Deborah

2236
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:36,719
you want to say something

2237
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:40,219
oh she was waving that's good enough

2238
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:46,339
that Deborah Burger

2239
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,420
great to have you both here joining us

2240
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:51,540
remotely okay now it's your chance for

2241
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:56,120
questions oh wait Pete ah there

2242
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,600
hi all Pete Resnick

2243
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,540
um so when you posted the announcement

2244
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:06,420
for Warren taking over the liaison it

2245
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:08,699
caused the conversation and I thought I

2246
01:25:08,699 --> 01:25:12,239
meant to send email but you're all here

2247
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,460
um I want to encourage you to do more

2248
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:17,340
with Liaisons in particular when you

2249
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:19,320
made the announcement it would have been

2250
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,600
great to not only have that he was doing

2251
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,400
this and Allison was stepping down but

2252
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,800
what that liaison's about why it's still

2253
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,600
important to keep because I assume you

2254
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,780
folks review them every so often

2255
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:32,940
um Warren happens to be an AED and I

2256
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:35,159
know we generally don't assign liaison

2257
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:37,739
ads to be Liaisons because of possible

2258
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:40,080
conflicts of interest why that was an

2259
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,820
okay thing

2260
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:44,159
um so I think that would be a great you

2261
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,080
know opportunity every time you make a

2262
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,580
change to let us know what's going on

2263
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:50,100
but I also encourage you talk to some

2264
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,500
working groups when they're doing work

2265
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,800
that impacts Liaisons and kind of let

2266
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,780
people know that you're there would be

2267
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:01,139
really a good thing over the long term

2268
01:26:01,139 --> 01:26:03,000
so actually that feedback reached us

2269
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,360
already so we're aware of that

2270
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,100
um I want to say a couple of things

2271
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,199
um we already know that we can improve

2272
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:11,820
the information we provide about liaison

2273
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:13,560
that's something we are working on um

2274
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,300
and as always the IEP is slow on this

2275
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,699
but we are working on that

2276
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:19,860
um the other thing is um we actually

2277
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:22,620
didn't really consider to kind of taking

2278
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:25,679
a liaison down because that might give a

2279
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:27,300
wrong signal to the other organization

2280
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,040
right so this is like something that has

2281
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,420
to be treated very carefully so we

2282
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:32,880
usually try to replace people but it's

2283
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,920
also not that easy to find people in the

2284
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,080
space because we need experts that are

2285
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,340
kind of knowledgeable in both

2286
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:42,179
organizations so the set is very limited

2287
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:45,780
um and but gladly a lot of the Leo songs

2288
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:48,179
are actually working very well

2289
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:49,320
um and then to your third point about

2290
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,940
working groups it's but it's not always

2291
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,219
required to have the official years not

2292
01:26:53,219 --> 01:26:54,840
to do good work we actually encourage

2293
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,540
people to just like work on a technical

2294
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,940
basis and talk to each other because

2295
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:01,860
that gives us the best outcome the cases

2296
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,840
where we have leosource there is some

2297
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,460
kind of formal requirement where we

2298
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,320
otherwise cannot access certain

2299
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,600
documents in the other organization or

2300
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,159
where it's just like the process of the

2301
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:13,080
organization as that like requires this

2302
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,460
kind of process so it does not usually

2303
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:16,500
come from our side from our side we just

2304
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,060
usually try to work together and do good

2305
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:22,139
work that's the main incentive okay

2306
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:24,900
West West URL is not coordinator you get

2307
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,159
the first word

2308
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:28,139
um so Pete thanks for the question it's

2309
01:27:28,139 --> 01:27:31,080
a good one um I I think in the process

2310
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,360
of revamping the liaison uh coordination

2311
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,980
role in the last couple years you know

2312
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,480
we've made a lot of positive changes and

2313
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,920
we're not done yet

2314
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,380
um a couple of ones to point out one is

2315
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,540
in fact this IAB open was the first time

2316
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:44,760
where we actually had a presentation

2317
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,760
from a liaison manager about what that

2318
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,560
organization was when it was about IEEE

2319
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,679
thank you so well you can think Russ it

2320
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:54,120
was a really good one second time okay

2321
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,100
second time we are trying to do that

2322
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,440
every IAB open assuming you know there's

2323
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,360
there's time on the agenda to do so but

2324
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,980
that's actually a high priority for us

2325
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:05,040
because of exactly what you said right

2326
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,480
um I have learned a lot in the last

2327
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,000
couple years as liaison coordinator the

2328
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,320
vast number of things that we have

2329
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,360
relationships with and more about them

2330
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,280
and I'm not done learning myself so

2331
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,360
there's a lot to learn and we're

2332
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,159
continuing to ramp that up so expect to

2333
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:19,440
see more of that in the future

2334
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,780
um one of the other things that we're

2335
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:24,300
doing a lot of lately is asking people

2336
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,480
in those roles who are the other ietf

2337
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,699
members that might be participating in

2338
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,560
both organizations so that we can sort

2339
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,780
of start building a list of and

2340
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:36,179
understanding who is who is available to

2341
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:37,980
fill these positions in the case of

2342
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,179
Warren he was actually the only person

2343
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:41,100
that volunteered we didn't we did make a

2344
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,020
call for volunteers and Warren's like

2345
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,760
I'll do it if nobody else does so you

2346
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,560
know Warren got the job

2347
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,219
um there are a couple of of

2348
01:28:49,219 --> 01:28:51,840
organizations that are much more remote

2349
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,420
and uh less familiar I mean Russ talked

2350
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:55,920
about IEEE today and I think most people

2351
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,900
here at least have some knowledge about

2352
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:00,300
IEEE whereas some of the other

2353
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,340
organizations that's not true and so our

2354
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,260
goal is to continue that education over

2355
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:07,460
time so thank you for the question

2356
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,920
a quick point from from the IHF side of

2357
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:11,760
things

2358
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,460
um so obviously iib establishes manages

2359
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:15,840
these relationships but they're critical

2360
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,780
to the work of the of the iatf right and

2361
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,400
um for some of these organizations

2362
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,199
especially sort of the the more formal

2363
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:25,139
older sdos right they're quite difficult

2364
01:29:25,139 --> 01:29:27,179
to establish and and once you have one

2365
01:29:27,179 --> 01:29:29,040
it's worth holding on to it even though

2366
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,420
it might go dormant for a little while

2367
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:33,239
because sometimes it can take a long

2368
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:34,920
time to get it back and if you need it

2369
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,440
and you don't have it right it's a

2370
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,699
little bit like an insurance kind of

2371
01:29:38,699 --> 01:29:41,340
thing right so so it's it's not a bad

2372
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:44,100
thing if a liaison is is quiet for a

2373
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,840
while right it's probably actually a

2374
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,159
good thing

2375
01:29:47,159 --> 01:29:49,020
um but but giving it up as you mentioned

2376
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:51,060
that right it is a is a very deliberate

2377
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:52,440
choice and we need to be very careful

2378
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,139
that that when we do that

2379
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,960
foreign

2380
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,980
okay then we take the next question

2381
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:01,280
Andrew

2382
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,699
why thank you uh

2383
01:30:10,699 --> 01:30:13,980
uh Andrew camping um

2384
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,860
I think it was really

2385
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:20,460
it was great to see the recent uh M10 uh

2386
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,080
Workshop

2387
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,000
um although I could politely say it's

2388
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,639
the nine years after the publication RFC

2389
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:29,520
yes 7258

2390
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:33,060
um so great to see it but maybe

2391
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:35,580
could be done quite a few years earlier

2392
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,920
and I wonder is there a mechanism for

2393
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,139
the community to sort of identify things

2394
01:30:40,139 --> 01:30:42,540
where the IB could help get ahead of the

2395
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:45,600
curve in considering sort of big

2396
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,000
significant architecture issues

2397
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,060
um to give direction uh rather so than

2398
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:53,159
sort of catching up what can we do to

2399
01:30:53,159 --> 01:30:55,920
help with that thank you

2400
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,960
I mean join the IB

2401
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:00,020
um

2402
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:03,239
um so I think that the one tool um that

2403
01:31:03,239 --> 01:31:04,739
we use like actually they're multiple

2404
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:06,000
tools that we used to engage with the

2405
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,679
community but the one that is like the

2406
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:09,179
the most predominant is that we have

2407
01:31:09,179 --> 01:31:11,400
these iav programs which we try to set

2408
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,260
up on topics where we think like a

2409
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,300
discussion with the IRB

2410
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,460
um is needed but I also have to admit

2411
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:20,280
that what the IEP is driving also

2412
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,500
depends a little bit on the members on

2413
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,400
the iib of course and uh and we are we

2414
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,020
are trying to or like the Nom come is

2415
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:29,340
actually doing a great job trying to

2416
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:31,920
cover broad expertise on the IRB but

2417
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,320
that always influences on where we're

2418
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,179
focusing on because we also just have

2419
01:31:36,179 --> 01:31:38,400
limited capacity of course so I'm not

2420
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,960
sure that answers your question but

2421
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,960
there are more people here

2422
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,159
[Music]

2423
01:31:43,159 --> 01:31:47,639
yeah so um one way is to send us email

2424
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:49,380
um and there's some recent examples like

2425
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:52,139
this uh uh environmental impacts

2426
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,179
Workshop that we're Now setting up for

2427
01:31:54,179 --> 01:31:55,440
for next month

2428
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,440
um that actually came about uh through

2429
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,840
several channels so there was some IAB

2430
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,340
members who were interested about it

2431
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:05,040
about a topic we thought this was

2432
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,800
important uh it was seen as uh in some

2433
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,260
parts of the industry as as uh you know

2434
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:12,900
an important issue to solve but we also

2435
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,120
got uh

2436
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,739
uh connections from from other people

2437
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:19,320
outside the IAB a total different groups

2438
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:21,659
who were thinking about this and and

2439
01:32:21,659 --> 01:32:24,179
were proposing a workshop on on this

2440
01:32:24,179 --> 01:32:26,699
this topic so we put our uh efforts

2441
01:32:26,699 --> 01:32:29,520
together and uh now we are looking

2442
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,900
forward to a very interesting workshop

2443
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:34,020
with uh 30 or so papers submitted from

2444
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,540
different angles so

2445
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:38,940
talk to us and uh it's not always just

2446
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:41,219
about like what I'm interested in right

2447
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:43,080
now I might actually be interested after

2448
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,760
you explain that this is important for

2449
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,040
these and these reasons and then I and

2450
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,139
other IAB members would get into that

2451
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:51,900
and uh yeah we'd like to hear from you

2452
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:52,630
thank you

2453
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:54,780
[Music]

2454
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:59,400
yep so one other quick point is we try

2455
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,560
and have workshops where we believe that

2456
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,780
progress can be made and and a lot of

2457
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:05,040
times if there's already progress

2458
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,960
happening in the industry it doesn't

2459
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,460
make sense for us to hold something when

2460
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:09,540
there's already a lot of other stuff

2461
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:11,400
going on or there's other times it's

2462
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,020
often too early that we don't think

2463
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,340
progress can be made because the

2464
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,900
technology is not there yet so getting

2465
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:18,060
that timing rate has been a struggle and

2466
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:19,199
we've we've thought about many other

2467
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:20,820
workshops that we have not actually put

2468
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:22,440
out because it didn't seem like it was

2469
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,300
the right time or or there it wasn't

2470
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,679
going to be a productive conversation

2471
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,420
I'm very happy that the last few went

2472
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:30,500
off so so well so

2473

01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,940
please go ahead are you in the room I

2548
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:02,460
think yeah I'm here hi hi

2549
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,960
is the Australian

2550
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,960
so my question

2551
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:09,500
my question is I don't think this is uh

2552
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:13,139
iesg responsible things but I'd like to

2553
01:37:13,139 --> 01:37:16,159
hear the mood of this community

2554
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:19,800
uh so few days ago there was a new

2555
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,260
mailing list announcement that the name

2556
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:24,900
of storing telling AG

2557
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:29,360
so I wonder what kind of story we are

2558
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:33,480
collecting for this ETF especially for

2559
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:34,580
the local

2560
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:39,239
story things because as a yokama

2561
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:41,760
resident I'd like to talk about

2562
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,360
something about Yokohama

2563
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:49,679
for the next year but if uh what kind of

2564
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:54,179
story are you are willing to know for

2565
01:37:54,179 --> 01:37:56,699
example if you want to see cherry

2566
01:37:56,699 --> 01:38:01,519
blossoms I'd like to introduce

2567
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:04,199
which is a very famous place or

2568
01:38:04,199 --> 01:38:07,920
something like that or very old story

2569
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,400
like reclaiming of Yokohama and such

2570
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:15,559
things so uh

2571
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:18,780
thanks for the question so this is a

2572
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,520
non-working group mailing list um which

2573
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,199
which is not technically under the

2574
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:24,239
purview of the isg other than we approve

2575
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:25,800
it and we are very generously improving

2576
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,480
almost anything but I think we have a

2577
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,100
moderator or the initiator of the list

2578
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:30,780
of slowly walking up the microphone so

2579
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,960
Adrian can uh tell you exactly what the

2580
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,219
list is for

2581
01:38:35,219 --> 01:38:39,000
yeah hi I'm Adrian Farrell um uh we

2582
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,820
asked for this list this was uh Ola

2583
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:44,460
Johansson and I asked for this list

2584
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:48,480
um under I think Warren's care as sort

2585
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,659
of supervisor of affiliate groups the

2586
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:53,639
purpose of this type of mailing list is

2587
01:38:53,639 --> 01:38:56,400
just to bring people together from the

2588
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,560
community have a shared interest so like

2589
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,900
there's a list for people who go running

2590
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:05,040
God help them uh and uh

2591
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:09,600
um we have an interest in uh stories uh

2592
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,020
Ola particularly storytelling me writing

2593
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:16,080
stories and we are just interested to

2594
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,719
see if there are people who like stories

2595
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,719
sharing stories and one possible thread

2596
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:25,020
to all this is stories about the history

2597
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:28,620
of the internet and the ietf that we're

2598
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:32,280
aware maybe getting lost uh in time and

2599
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:34,440
it might be fun to collect

2600
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,540
you should definitely talk to Mrs

2601
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:38,340
Sandusky over there I think there will

2602
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,920
be plenty of stories for you to start on

2603
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,840
and yeah thank you

2604
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,120
um so seeing as you talk about affiliate

2605
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,860
groups a quick bit of background on him

2606
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:49,860
we all spend a lot of time together like

2607
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,659
a couple of weeks a year

2608
01:39:51,659 --> 01:39:53,760
and it seems silly to me that we don't

2609
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,560
have a way to sort of find other people

2610
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,480
in the iitf community with shared

2611
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:59,880
interests so that's kind of the purpose

2612
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,800
of affiliate groups if you're interested

2613
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:02,820
in something

2614
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,320
you know and you think there are other

2615
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,600
people in the ietf and you want to form

2616
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,699
sort of a social group or a way to find

2617
01:40:08,699 --> 01:40:11,219
each other and self-organize that's the

2618
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:13,199
purpose of affiliate groups

2619
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:14,820
um they're linked somewhere in data

2620
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:17,219
tracker if you search for ietf affiliate

2621
01:40:17,219 --> 01:40:19,380
groups you'll find the page and you know

2622
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,600
we would like there to be a community of

2623
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,639
people interested in the topic and

2624
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:25,020
they're really easy to set up it's

2625
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,820
basically a mailing list and then

2626
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,620
whoever organizes it sort of make sure

2627
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,179
that it's

2628
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:32,520
um doing something and people are being

2629
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,320
friendly and

2630
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,699
and personable and that's it

2631
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:41,219
[Music]

2632
01:40:41,219 --> 01:40:43,560
because it this reminds us that we as a

2633
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,540
community should be telling stories like

2634
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,880
we should together have good experience

2635
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:51,179
and and work as a community and um I

2636
01:40:51,179 --> 01:40:52,980
think that was your intention of coming

2637
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,480
to America thank you for reminding us

2638
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,699
for that I'll also point out reading

2639
01:40:56,699 --> 01:40:58,320
some of the drafts I think we often are

2640
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,940
telling stories

2641
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:02,040
foreign

2642
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:06,360
let's not make the useful one uh

2643
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:09,420
uh Abdul Salam uh is a remote I believe

2644
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:12,239
could you start your video and ask a

2645
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:13,380
question please

2646
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:18,960
yes do you hear me yes

2647
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:23,820
I've uh hello I have asked the question

2648
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:26,960
before regarding uh

2649
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,320
the the cross layering or let the cross

2650
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,619
cross area documents

2651
01:41:33,619 --> 01:41:38,880
uh and I'm interested to know uh uh how

2652
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:43,080
the ad or the director for each area uh

2653
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:46,980
deals with uh with uh active documents

2654
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:51,060
which may uh become in the future uh

2655
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:55,139
interrelated to other working groups uh

2656
01:41:55,139 --> 01:41:59,400
and uh and and how do they uh between

2657
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,940
them how do they work together to make

2658
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:07,440
uh uh a better standard as as I have

2659
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:11,340
seen some a new working group is uh is

2660
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:15,360
established as let's say Computing aware

2661
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,020
or let's say a routing protocol is aware

2662
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:22,340
of another uh uh

2663
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:28,080
other protocol or another uh layer so uh

2664
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:31,980
there are some cross cross uh

2665
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:38,100
uh area uh issues here so could you just

2666
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:41,880
give me some uh maybe between uh or one

2667
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:47,000
of you can give me some uh uh uh sure

2668
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,199
often different approaches right so so

2669
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:51,900
some do work like squarely fits into one

2670
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:53,100
area and there's no need to really

2671
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:54,659
discuss you know whether TCP work

2672
01:42:54,659 --> 01:42:56,280
belongs in transport

2673
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,780
um but for things that cross the area it

2674
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:59,340
gets interesting as you note right and

2675
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,780
there's a bunch of different ways in

2676
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,219
which we do this like one principle for

2677
01:43:02,219 --> 01:43:04,320
example is that you look at

2678
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,659
um where are the harder problems right

2679
01:43:06,659 --> 01:43:08,219
so for example if it's a thing between

2680
01:43:08,219 --> 01:43:11,100
like say security and transport we would

2681
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,139
say you know is the security side the

2682
01:43:13,139 --> 01:43:15,360
heart thing or is the transport side and

2683
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,800
so we would sort of probably then place

2684
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,900
it with the area

2685
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,340
um where we believe the harder problems

2686
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:22,920
lie so that those experts have it a bit

2687
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,600
more visible on their radar as they look

2688
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,340
at work groups and agendas but there's

2689
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:28,679
other principles and and I see Eric has

2690
01:43:28,679 --> 01:43:31,679
a stand up yeah basically first notice

2691
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:34,460
that the areas are not isolated silos

2692
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:37,199
and guess what ad talks to each other

2693
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,960
but basically they're also directorates

2694
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:42,840
pretty mad that's like young any working

2695
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,940
group share can request a young

2696
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:46,800
directorate's review or DNS directorate

2697
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,840
review which I'm sure already some kind

2698
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:52,199
of cross area relationships and quite

2699
01:43:52,199 --> 01:43:54,600
often we when we spot this when we talk

2700
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:57,000
with chairs as an ID I understand that

2701
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,520
the chairs have some document in my

2702
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,280
areas in my working group say oh please

2703
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,500
request the working group last call to

2704
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,600
also be said and forward it to another

2705
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:09,540
working group and essentially some

2706
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:12,420
you say cross-go area collaboration we

2707
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,340
even within an area so there are

2708
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:16,380
multiple ways of doing it

2709
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:19,020
Warren yeah I mean Eric covered a lot of

2710
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:21,780
it already but there's also sort of when

2711
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:24,060
new work starts up we try and have Buffs

2712
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:25,619
and we try and schedule them when sort

2713
01:44:25,619 --> 01:44:27,300
of lots of people can show up so we

2714
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:29,219
share that information

2715
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:31,260
um what says Eric said you know ads chat

2716
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:32,760
amongst themselves a lot especially

2717
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:35,100
about cross area stuff we're also trying

2718
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,840
to do things like the technology deep

2719
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,179
Dives things to try and sort of get more

2720
01:44:39,179 --> 01:44:41,219
discussion between areas and make sure

2721
01:44:41,219 --> 01:44:42,719
that we don't end up quite as much in

2722
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:46,340
silos and Murray

2723
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:50,159
I'm very strict about the queues

2724
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:51,900
add on all the other techniques we've

2725
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,400
already talked about we've had a lot of

2726
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:57,060
success in planning up front and we do

2727
01:44:57,060 --> 01:44:59,340
that into two ways so Lars had alluded

2728
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:00,659
to this idea of where is the problem

2729
01:45:00,659 --> 01:45:03,900
harder we we have a tendency to send the

2730
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:06,179
send it to that area but we even have a

2731
01:45:06,179 --> 01:45:08,340
further refinement of that is to make

2732
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:09,659
sure we get that cross-area

2733
01:45:09,659 --> 01:45:11,460
collaboration and the work is seen by

2734
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:13,980
both areas we often assign an area

2735
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:16,860
director outside of the the place where

2736
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:18,900
it's home we have a couple examples we

2737
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,400
recently weren't sure we're Tigress

2738
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,800
there were issues to consider in art

2739
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,920
there are issues in sex so it is in uh

2740
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,480
it is housed in the art area but there's

2741
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,580
a responsible SEC A.D we've done that

2742
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:31,560
with things like skim we've done it with

2743
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:34,320
Ojai so this model kind of works in

2744
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,820
planning up front in that another

2745
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:38,400
mechanism we use to plan up front is to

2746
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,840
think through when we Charter to

2747
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,940
explicitly built into the structural

2748
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:43,739
it's the structural considerations of

2749
01:45:43,739 --> 01:45:45,239
the working group about what other

2750
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:47,639
working groups whether it's ITF or even

2751
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:49,380
kind of Liaisons and Partnerships we

2752
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:51,000
need to think about up front and then we

2753
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,500
name kind of parties based on how things

2754
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:55,260
are chartered right

2755
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:58,860
you covered Murray's case Robert

2756
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:01,080
another example we have is working

2757
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:03,119
groups like The iot Ops working group

2758
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,040
work sort of covering a technology area

2759
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,840
that spans multiple working groups in

2760
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,580
the ITF and the purpose of that working

2761
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:10,619
group is it necessarily to produce lots

2762
01:46:10,619 --> 01:46:12,360
of documents to act as like a

2763
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:13,619
coordination point between the working

2764
01:46:13,619 --> 01:46:15,840
groups and communication point between

2765
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:16,980
the different sorts of work that's

2766
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:18,480
happening elsewhere so that's another

2767
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:19,860
example of how we try and solve this

2768
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:22,139
sort of cross cross area across working

2769
01:46:22,139 --> 01:46:22,920
group problems

2770
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:26,020
[Music]

2771
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:27,980
okay I hope that answered the question

2772
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:31,580
are there other questions

2773
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:39,119
