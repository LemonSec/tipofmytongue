00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,100
foreign

2
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,080
so

3
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,640
thank you

4
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,979
foreign

5
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,939
welcome area this is the same networking

6
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,119
group and this is our second working

7
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,479
second meeting after our working group

8
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,060
is established

9
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,600
so uh it's a Pity that uh my culture

10
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,740
cannot attend the meeting and you know

11
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,979
have your participated media remotely

12
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,159
foreign

13
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,818
Setters and currently there are already

14
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,060
nine documents that have been uploaded

15
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,760
to the cell net

16
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,680
reportery which covers the problem

17
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,599
segment use case and requirement and the

18
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,040
seventh architecture and the solution

19
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,940
analysis aspect uh and for the first

20
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,239
step uh for the first part this off has

21
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,120
been present at the last meeting and the

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,540
author of the lead draft has clarified

23
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,959
the uh the concert that this is the deal

24
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,440
in the last practitioner and also update

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,160
there and their their document

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,780
accordingly and they will print the

27
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,200
update content today

28
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,120
the second part is the cell net

29
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,280
architecture and this is the first time

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,879
to practice in this meeting and also the

31
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,080
some drops that uh for the some initial

32
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,239
answers for the essential and the

33
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,739
influence for the new solution and uh

34
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,780
for the uh yeah lastly

35
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,400
there are also some detailed solutions

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,280
that aim to solve the similar problem

37
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,480
but not align with the proper sales net

38
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
architecture document uh we will find

39
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,360
some manager to try to sing up them

40
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,819
later

41
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,040
and now we are in according our

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,459
Milestone we are now in the face of our

43
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,140
first Milestone so the aim of the uh our

44
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,340
media we want to

45
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,599
occupant use case and the requirement

46
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,179
document during these times

47
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,940
so here is the goal of our this meeting

48
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,220
firstly we will focus on the discuss of

49
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,139
the

50
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,000
statement problem and requirement and

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,780
the capital capital

52
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,380
and after that we will discuss the uh

53
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,979
the the first the initial approach to

54
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,940
the solutions so we can evaluate the

55
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,419
capacities and and the uh

56
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,440
as a requirement for the uh that we have

57
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,580
provide

58
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,820
and the last set we went to Empire that

59
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,639
uh currently we uh our our initial goal

60
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,840
is to finish the discussion of the

61
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,840
problem statement so after the this

62
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,759
video

63
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,759
If there is no more issue raised and we

64
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,759
will take the adoption code on the mail

65
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,199
list

66
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,199
um

67
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,000
so here is the draft agenda

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,180
I have introduced the uh

69
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,639
and the first section is the problem

70
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,800
seven there are three parts interest

71
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,199
and the incentive incentive policies

72
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,419
after that we will have an open

73
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,600
discussion for the document

74
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,900
and decided what's the next step at our

75
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,679
group we will forward

76
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,620
um

77
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,320
and uh the second part the second part

78
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,259
is the architecture

79
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,500
architecture path and we also will

80
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,900
introduce the

81
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,580
info as

82
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,720
solution architecture interest and the

83
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,960
unsung table uh

84
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,180
table design and principle after that we

85
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,100
will introduce a

86
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,819
I want another solution for the for the

87
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,580
same aim and the the last one is the

88
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,880
entities for the current current

89
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,819
solution okay so uh

90
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,539
I think this is the WCR so if there is

91
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:41,539
no an issue I think we I want to um

92
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,199
move forward to the uh to the first

93
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,680
petition

94
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,280
I just want to discuss what Asian is

95
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,740
saying which is the charter has three

96
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,960
parts right and we really need to focus

97
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,419
on the first one

98
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:04,620
so uh you know what I would like to

99
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,479
suggest to to the chairs of course is

100
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,699
that uh yeah let's dedicate the time to

101
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,520
that if we start stretching a little bit

102
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,500
at the time uh we need to get those

103
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,300
those things done

104
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,979
um sooner there will be more time to

105
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,020
talk about the next steps architecture

106
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,900
and solutions

107
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,099
thank you so just to confirm what you

108
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,639
said okay thank you okay so we'll begin

109
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,780
the first operation I will

110
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,380
sorry

111
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,940
foreign

112
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,860
yeah okay okay can you control the slide

113
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,180
now

114
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,639
uh

115
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,960
yes I can okay okay

116
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:04,740
so stand IG and the Jewel for the hard

117
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,539
work

118
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:09,000
hello everyone I'm Danny from chinhua

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,360
University I'm sorry again that uh I

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,080
have to present the uh okay the draft

121
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,960
remotely uh this time

122
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,419
so uh next uh I will uh present the

123
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,500
updated version of the introduction rate

124
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,780
cap analysis problem statement and

125
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,620
requirements draft

126
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,620
uh so we know that as a cause of this

127
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,080
draft is to provide is it a couple

128
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,719
analysis of existing into domain soft

129
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,540
mechanisms summarize the fundamental

130
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,360
problems of existing instrumental

131
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,480
mechanisms and Define the requirements

132
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,959
for the new info domains of mechanism

133
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,680
so in uh in the last iatf meeting we

134
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,839
presented the first version of this

135
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,320
draft so that is version zero zero based

136
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,080
on the feedback we got in the last

137
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,320
meeting as well as the comments and

138
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
discussions in the mailing list

139
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,300
so we made the three runs over revisions

140
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,120
for this draft and today I will

141
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,940
presenting the latest version today's

142
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,440
version

143
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,860
003

144
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,180
here a couple analysis we presented the

145
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,200
last time for version zero zero we

146
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,040
discuss four scenarios where existing

147
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,800
into the minister of mechanisms cannot

148
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,100
satisfy the Practical requirements

149
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,040
the first scenario is for multi-home

150
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,399
established where

151
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,260
asymmetricology may need to improper

152
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,880
block problem

153
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,700
and this second scenario is that

154
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,820
existing in into the massive mechanism

155
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,839
that is English feature okay only works

156
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,320
for the moving traffic Arrangement here

157
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,920
from the sublet it cannot work for

158
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,199
spoofing traffic from in One Direction

159
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,399
this sort of scenario is for easy

160
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,459
problem for partial deployment so

161
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,279
various reasons can lead to partial

162
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,820
deployment for into the myself mechanism

163
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,180
so if some Edge routers do not deploy

164
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,019
English featuring there is no way for

165
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,380
the installment Network to validate the

166
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,660
spoofing traffic originated from the

167
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,300
subjects that directly connecting the

168
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,220
edges authors

169
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,120
energy fourth scenario is a misbehave

170
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,060
result the last time we presented that

171
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,019
uh result may not Faithfully conduct

172
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,100
Southern mechanism

173
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,079
so since the last iitf meeting we

174
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,800
received okay a lot of comments uh and

175
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,459
feedback for the draft we presented

176
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:18,240
uh we made the summary there are four

177
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,899
major comments the first is that why

178
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,120
couldn't you deploy itself at all

179
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,940
doctors in the into the network

180
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,700
the second is that defining Network

181
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,000
elements are trusted or untrusted is

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,560
very hard

183
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,800
the third problem is that misaligned

184
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,680
incentive means the cost of deploying

185
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,339
soft are paid by operator itself while

186
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,220
its benefits are only experienced by

187
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,040
other operators but in for the network

188
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,360
is rarely managed by multiple operators

189
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,600
and as a force comment is that are we

190
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,959
talking about non-ip package as well

191
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,459
there are also some manner comments

192
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,000
so

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,079
we just meet the revisions for the draft

194
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,279
to address all the concerns we received

195
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,160
and the main updates of this latest

196
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,459
version compared to the first version

197
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,380
okay I have

198
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,800
uh four kinds of major updates the first

199
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,640
is the updates in the cap analysis part

200
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,740
we explain the reasons for partial

201
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,160
deployment and remove the scenario of a

202
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,240
misbehaviors author

203
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,860
so for partial deployment I think we had

204
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,680
uh okay not all of our discussions in

205
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,740
the business as pointed the order okay

206
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,480
by some experts okay we acknowledge that

207
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,940
there are two main reasons for partial

208
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,300
deployment of into domain soft mechanism

209
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,240
the first is that the technical

210
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,459
limitation of today's into domestic

211
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,100
mechanism may make it hard to deploy

212
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,740
itself are always authors for example

213
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,440
this Airbase to solve requires many

214
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,019
configuration in Dynamic Networks

215
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,420
stricter your RPF Ingress filtering

216
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,240
blocks legal traffic in the scenario of

217
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,180
asymmetric technology I think okay these

218
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,579
issues are pointed out by some okay

219
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,040
operators in the mailing list

220
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,519
and the second reason is that some

221
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,980
results cannot support staff due to

222
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,260
doctoral capabilities versions and

223
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,639
vendors

224
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,720
actually the first reason for the

225
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,720
partial deployment may be okay overcome

226
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,120
by a news of mechanism

227
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,300
part of the second issue may still exist

228
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,820
for any kind of new infotainment of

229
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,459
mechanism so we still have to take

230
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,560
partial deployment into consideration

231
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,260
when designing a new instruments of

232
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,279
mechanism

233
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,279
and the behavior Gap in the scenario of

234
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,160
partial deployment is that when Ingress

235
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,440
filtering is partially deployed the

236
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,740
spoofing traffic from The undeployed

237
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,440
Edge routers cannot be blocked by other

238
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,240
routers either into the network

239
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,899
the second major update is in the

240
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,899
problem statement part we remove the

241
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,019
problem of misaligned incentive but the

242
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,079
problem of high operational overhead and

243
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,540
revise the description of other problems

244
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,180
actually all these points are just the

245
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,240
uh the response to the comments in the

246
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,720
mailing list

247
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,620
in the latest version We summarize the

248
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,199
problems of existing into domain soft

249
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:57,779
mechanisms okay as uh okay just a three

250
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,540
major problems the first problem is

251
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,699
inaccurate validation

252
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,760
the behavior Gap is that asymmetrical

253
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,160
routine may need to improper block

254
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,880
scenario in okay multi Home Connection

255
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,420
case the reason is that existing into

256
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,360
the mess of mechanism conducts itself

257
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,060
based on the local feed which may not

258
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,279
match the real data putting forwarding

259
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,500
tasks from the source

260
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,920
the second problem is limited protection

261
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,160
the behavior Gap is that okay we may

262
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
feel to block this moving traffic from

263
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,380
outside the airs North okay from the

264
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,240
anti

265
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,940
undeployed edges altered because

266
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,040
existing interdomeness of mechanism only

267
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,260
works for traffic from the directly

268
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,540
connected sublets

269
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,940
and this sort of problem is a high

270
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,680
operational overhead

271
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,160
as the pointed out by some operators in

272
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,660
the main nest

273
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,000
the behavior Gap is that the manual

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,699
updates okay are necessary when the

275
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:06,079
result is changed in the network because

276
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,459
existing okay into the minister of

277
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,220
mechanism for years to adapt to dynamic

278
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,199
or asymmetrical routine scenarios

279
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,660
the third update is in the requirements

280
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,420
part we remove the requirement of direct

281
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,120
incentive at the requirement of

282
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,880
acceptable overhead and revised the

283
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,959
description of other requirements

284
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:33,540
in the latest version We summarize the

285
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,180
requirements for allele infra domains of

286
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,480
mechanism as a okay three parts the

287
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,000
first requirement is that the mechanism

288
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,240
must ensure accurate yourself the new

289
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,060
soft mechanism should match must match

290
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,820
the real data plane forwarding parts and

291
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,279
avoid improper block under asymmetric

292
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,339
analogy the statement requirement is

293
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,920
that the mechanism must work for all

294
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,100
kinds of interdome spoofing traffic

295
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,919
be the master be able to validate the

296
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,619
traffic from all directions specifically

297
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,380
it should be able to block the spoofing

298
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,199
traffic from the offset is or from the

299
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,679
unemployed edges altered and the okay

300
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,780
the block should be as close to the

301
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,579
source as possible

302
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,040
and in this third requirement is that

303
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,099
the mechanism must not induce Max

304
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,559
overhead it means that we should

305
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,620
minimize manual updates to avoid data

306
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,840
playing packet modification then limit

307
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,520
the number of controller messages

308
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,780
the the final update is that we add two

309
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,380
new sections in the latest draft but one

310
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,539
for the survey though okay the internet

311
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,760
works to press other for security

312
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,179
considerations

313
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:57,840
first we okay uh for the intro domain

314
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,380
software work scope we think that or IP

315
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,620
encapsulated scenarios are in scope

316
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,780
including both actually before and IPv6

317
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,559
addresses and now IP packets are out of

318
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,260
scope because our purpose is to validate

319
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,539
the source I shall addresses not other

320
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,520
source information

321
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,160
for security consideration we stated

322
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,919
that staff needs focuses on launching

323
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,039
protocol-based mechanisms so this so the

324
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,440
security scope of each other myself that

325
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,080
should be similar to that of into the

326
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,700
minority protocols

327
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,820
it means that we should ensure integrity

328
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,220
and authentication of control plan

329
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,160
protocol messages and do not provide

330
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,919
protection against the compromised

331
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,679
adulterers that may point the existing

332
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,380
control protocols

333
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,700
okay that's all of my presentation uh

334
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,520
okay comments feedback are welcome thank

335
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,700
you

336
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,539
Hi how are you yeah so I know so uh if

337
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,280
there is no question I I think this

338
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,679
topic has been discussed solely in the

339
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,559
last meeting and also oh

340
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,820
okay so there is the The Cure in the uh

341
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,140
for the question so

342
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,059
okay with a moment

343
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:34,139
uh okay

344
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,640
I cannot hear you

345
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,600
hey

346
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,260
you need to press the microphone icon on

347
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,360
the media can you hear me now

348
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,340
yeah yes

349
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,980
yeah okay um I have a question I see the

350
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,480
repeated uh use of the term intra intra

351
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,860
are are we sure that that's actually the

352
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,480
correct term to use or should we be

353
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,160
using enter int ER

354
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,140
oh

355
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,179
you mean the term

356
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,919
uh

357
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,059
iPhone yeah the I pre I presented the

358
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,340
instrument part now we have the

359
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,820
interdomen part and later but I

360
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,539
I am wondering which part you mean that

361
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,080
we use the int to

362
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,580
represent the intro

363
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,799
right yeah I believe I believe the

364
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,960
entire Focus uh and if I'm mistaken

365
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,340
please feel free to point it out but I

366
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,020
think that we're looking at inter-domain

367
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,760
rather than intra domain

368
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,000
oh what people don't care the charter is

369
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,460
explicit that we are looking at both and

370
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,260
that's why we have separate evaluation

371
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,900
documents for both Roland

372
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,760
I understand but when I actually read

373
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,740
through the documents it seems like the

374
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,840
entire Focus almost is on interdomain

375
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,640
anyway it's just a linguistic thing I

376
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,020
want to make sure that that we are

377
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,400
accurately

378
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,559
um representing what we're discussing

379
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,660
here for the majority of in the majority

380
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,400
of the documents and proposals that's

381
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,220
all I had thanks

382
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,179
okay thank you

383
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,620
Anthony okay

384
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,620
um

385
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,200
could you go back a few slides because

386
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,900
I must apologize not having completely

387
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,240
read that the the changes between the

388
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,820
drafts I'm looking for the part of

389
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,799
miscellaneous engine there it is the one

390
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,500
word one more further so do I understand

391
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,380
that you removed the part of the

392
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,620
misaligned incentive and I was wondering

393
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,919
what the reason was

394
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:01,440
yeah last time uh okay we met uh

395
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,419
assumption that uh into the network may

396
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:09,480
be managed by multiple operators

397
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,760
so okay there is some deployment and

398
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,000
incentive problem but a lot of colleges

399
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,159
in the mailing lists argue that

400
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,640
eagerly into the network is managed by

401
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,580
only one operator so the incentive

402
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,640
problem primarily exists for interdoma

403
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,940
part not for instrument part

404
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,659
so I just remove this this

405
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:35,820
content yeah yeah so the comment I want

406
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,240
to make is that even for inter-domain

407
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,700
connections there is an incentive

408
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,780
for staff to be deployed but it's not so

409
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,670
much a technical

410
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,539
[Music]

411
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,280
incentive it's a very commercial

412
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919
incentive but actually because when

413
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,539
you're implementing saf you will see

414
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,059
that your traffic on your network will

415
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,100
go down for your network and for your

416
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,840
customers which means that you have more

417
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,580
capacity on your network

418
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,520
this is a commercial incentive that I

419
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,980
you know people fail to see because yeah

420
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,559
you have to do something for it you have

421
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,100
to convince your your customers or your

422
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,260
connections you know to to to sign

423
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,919
rowers or to have proper IR data but

424
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,020
once you start filtering there is an

425
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,120
incentive for your own network so the

426
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,980
misalignment is

427
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,179
perhaps not so much technical but

428
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,200
commercial-wise I think there is an

429
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,240
incentive to deploy Source address

430
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,580
validation

431
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,620
okay uh I

432
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,240
uh

433
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,460
you just had a very good question I

434
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,559
don't know we made a lot of discussions

435
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,659
for the incentive problems and many

436
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,960
names okay the primary concern is okay

437
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,840
how to encourage a operator to benefit

438
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,900
from the south mechanism they deploy I

439
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,240
think we will have a lot of discussions

440
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,039
is the two presentations later so uh

441
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,559
okay

442
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,280
right we're taking it

443
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,200
you know to to harass customers and

444
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,700
saying you know you have to clean up

445
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,740
your network Administration it's a dull

446
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,039
and boring job but once you do it your

447
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,020
network will benefit

448
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,140
yeah yeah actually for our two

449
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,179
parenthesis nature we just want to

450
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,100
translate this requirements into

451
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,860
technical problem so I hope that we can

452
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,620
have more discussions later but I'm not

453
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,260
sure okay which part should be put into

454
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,480
Instagram part or Internet part maybe

455
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,419
that's a okay a problem we need a more

456
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:45,559
discussion later yeah

457
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,600
okay thank you

458
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,299
I just wanted to respond to the last

459
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,440
comment here at the mic uh if you are

460
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,799
running a a network

461
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:07,799
and a customer says it works on provider

462
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,200
a but not on provider B and provider B

463
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,760
is the good actor

464
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,559
there is a very strong commercial

465
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,880
incentive

466
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,880
to relent on that

467
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,380
and

468
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,460
what we have to be very cognizant on is

469
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,320
that any sort of source address

470
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,419
validation may actually break more

471
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,419
things than it is preventing

472
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,900
because it is the largest attacks that

473
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,980
we see today are not from sourced from

474
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,000
spoofed packets

475
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,120
foreign

476
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,319
[Music]

477
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,779
carefully and send the term in the

478
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,600
mailing list and all the issues have

479
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,799
been tracked in the GitHub so and of

480
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,779
course welcome to join the main list and

481
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,080
we can discuss this draft further to

482
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,140
improve continuously important this

483
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,320
document and about uh

484
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,220
the discussion of incentive uh

485
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,419
uh I think that there is no uh question

486
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,419
about whether is no miscellaneous

487
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,940
incentive in the infra domain networks

488
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,700
of the discussion is about uh

489
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,940
our colleges will introduce the internal

490
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,020
domain draft to presenter uh how can we

491
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,720
improve the incentive or for SLA

492
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,000
mechanisms by technical uh

493
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,220
technical improvements of course we

494
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,960
canceled the incentive problem uh

495
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,580
material okay

496
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,820
foreign

497
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:32,659
foreign

498
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,520
slide now

499
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,760
yeah yes I can Okay so let's begin

500
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,059
okay

501
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,279
hello everyone I'm launching from

502
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,940
University we have submitted a new

503
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,059
version of source address validation in

504
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,120
interdomen networks interdom and subnet

505
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,179
Gap analysis problem statement and

506
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,740
requirements

507
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,100
now I'm going to introduce the updates

508
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,059
we have made

509
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,580
this draft aims to provide the Gap

510
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,340
analysis of existing interdomensive

511
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,580
mechanisms summarize the fundamental

512
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,460
problems of existing interdomensive

513
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,940
mechanisms and Define the requirements

514
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,899
for the new interdomenal mechanism

515
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:29,580
we introduced the version 0 0 in last

516
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,000
ITF meeting and received several

517
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,299
questions and comments in and after that

518
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,200
meeting

519
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,740
based on the discussions in the meeting

520
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,100
list we have been constantly revising

521
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,419
the draft in the past few months and we

522
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:54,899
submitted the version 0 3 recently

523
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,480
this is a quick review of version zero

524
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,159
zero

525
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,940
we proposed four scenarios to describe

526
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,059
the gap of existing interdomenal

527
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:10,740
mechanisms

528
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,779
the scenario

529
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,840
one reflects attack and the scenario two

530
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,620
spoofing within the custom coin

531
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,620
existing internal domain cell mechanisms

532
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,840
may have improper permit problems

533
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,760
in scenarios of no export and scenario

534
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,500
of direct server return existing

535
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,360
interdomenal mechanisms may have

536
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,279
improper block problems

537
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,158
foreign

538
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,640
ly summarized two main problems of

539
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,000
existing interdomenal self mechanisms

540
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,659
they are limitations in accuracy and

541
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,539
misaligned incentive

542
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:03,720
we have received many questions about

543
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,080
the misaligned incentive

544
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,460
for example some some people asks how is

545
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,460
misaligned incentive different from

546
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,140
improper permit

547
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,100
or what incentive does cell net hope to

548
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,840
achieve

549
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,940
some people also ask

550
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,179
are we talking about non-ip packets as

551
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,360
well

552
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:32,399
we have discussed discussions in the

553
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,000
meeting list and we make some practice

554
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,100
to the latest version

555
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,360
first we improve the description of

556
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,799
misaligned incentive

557
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,360
misaligned incentive is one of the main

558
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,260
reasons why some asses haven't deployed

559
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,360
BCP 38

560
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,659
several Publications have also indicated

561
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,880
the misaligned incentive problem

562
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,419
bcp3h

563
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,960
only prunes the provider who deploys

564
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,440
served from originating spoofed Source

565
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,520
traffic

566
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,419
but doesn't protect the provider from

567
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:24,419
receiving spoofed traffic or being the

568
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,580
victim of an attack

569
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,260
it means the cost of deploying itself

570
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,880
are paid by the AIS itself but the

571
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,600
benefits are experienced by the rest of

572
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,080
the internet

573
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,760
compared to bcp38 efp uipf protects

574
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,000
deployed es from receiving spoofed

575
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,880
traffic from customer interfaces

576
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,140
so it can provide some direct Institute

577
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,880
however efp uipf is not real aligned

578
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,700
with market demand

579
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,159
it is because that ESP U RPF only

580
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,779
prevents customer code

581
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:19,260
from originating spoofed traffic that

582
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,260
doesn't protect custom coin from

583
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,960
receiving spoofed traffic from outside

584
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,159
custom coin

585
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,399
doesn't doesn't give additional defense

586
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,700
against reflection attacks by deploying

587
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,320
efp urpf

588
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,159
for example in in the two cases below

589
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,059
although the victim and its Upstream

590
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,240
provider deploy itself the reflection

591
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,120
attack still succeeds

592
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,320
more details will be introduced in the

593
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,899
next presentation about the soundness

594
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:06,960
incentive consideration for defense

595
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,639
against reflection attacks

596
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,300
finally we conclude the two fundamental

597
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,659
problems of existing interdomenal

598
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,379
mechanisms the first problem is

599
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,300
inaccurate stuff

600
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,480
existing interdominal cell mechanisms

601
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,960
have improper block or improper permit

602
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,918
problems it is because that they all

603
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,460
conduct serve based on local weave which

604
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,800
means not match the real data plan

605
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,219
forwarding path from the source

606
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,219
the second problem is misaligned

607
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,379
incentive

608
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:51,540
networks still suffer reflection attack

609
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,899
even though they have already deployed

610
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,839
South

611
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,980
it is because that in existing

612
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,940
interdomenal mechanisms the victim with

613
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,700
self-deployment does not participate in

614
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,940
protecting its source addresses from

615
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,839
being forced

616
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:21,240
according to the updates in problem

617
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,020
statement we further revise the

618
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,240
description of requirements

619
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,140
we Define four requirements for the new

620
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,320
interdominal sound mechanism

621
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,240
requirements number one the mechanism

622
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,140
must ensure accurate self by matching

623
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,780
the real data plan forwarding path

624
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,900
it should avoid improper block and

625
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,540
reduce improper bleed as much as

626
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,859
possible

627
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:57,000
since this requirement cannot be met by

628
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,599
using only local Europe information

629
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,940
additional mechanisms are needed to

630
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,480
provide the required information

631
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,180
requirement number two the mechanism

632
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,320
must provide direct incentive to the es

633
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,280
who deploys the it is required to

634
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,060
validate traffic from all directions and

635
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,960
help the deployed as mitigate spoof

636
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,540
Source attacks including reflection

637
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,460
attacks

638
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,220
requirement number three the mechanism

639
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,940
must support incremental deployment

640
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,300
it must prove and Source or just spoofy

641
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,420
when it is partially deployed in the

642
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,099
internet

643
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,180
requirement number four the mechanism

644
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,060
mustn't induce much overhead it must

645
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,140
avoid data plan packet modification and

646
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,140
the limit the number of control plane

647
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,920
protocol messages

648
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,520
we also add two new sections they are

649
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,180
interdominal

650
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,220
interdominal network scope and the

651
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,240
security considerations

652
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,900
for the internal domain sound Network

653
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,800
scope or IP encapsulated scenarios are

654
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,880
in scope

655
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,560
but no IP packets are out of scope for

656
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,140
security considerations

657
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,200
cell net focuses on Rock team protocol

658
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,040
based mechanisms so the security scope

659
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,380
of interdominal soundnet should be

660
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,980
similar to that of BJP

661
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,820
if the new interdominal style mechanism

662
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,020
requires counterpillar information

663
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,599
exchange there should be security

664
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:57,839
consider reasons on the avoidance of

665
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,960
message alteration or message injection

666
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,440
thank you

667
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,579
okay

668
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:24,300
hi so uh what you are saying about the

669
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,220
reflection attacks uh if the uh this is

670
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,480
sriram from nist uh if the victim of the

671
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,180
reflection attack is on your pisps

672
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,599
customer cone for example and you are

673
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,260
doing uh Source address validation uh

674
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,380
for your customer for your customers uh

675
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,320
in that case uh the reflection attack

676
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,740
will be detected and mitigated so it is

677
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,500
not so so it is not entirely true the

678
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,740
statement you made uh that efp uh urpf

679
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:05,160
cannot mitigate reflection attack uh uh

680
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,859
in general I mean it's only any

681
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,800
reflection attack that is originating in

682
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,720
your customer con and going to your

683
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,420
peers customer account uh where the

684
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,780
victim is uh if you are if deploying uh

685
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,260
in into domain Sav using efp or PF you

686
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,200
can definitely mitigate those reflection

687
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,799
attacks

688
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,839
well uh we can see

689
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,920
these two slides if the reflection

690
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,619
attack is originated from provider and

691
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,859
the peer interfaces it cannot prevent

692
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:49,380
the attack

693
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,660
right yeah in the scenario I am

694
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,780
presenting to you is uh it's you and a

695
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,599
lateral peer of yours the provided

696
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,560
question is uh somewhat different if if

697
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,440
you have a lateral peer and your

698
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,220
customer is uh from your customer

699
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,920
reflection attack is originating uh and

700
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,320
it is and the victim is in your peers

701
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,700
customer cone the efp you are PF is able

702
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,339
to catch that and mitigate it that's

703
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,560
what I'm saying

704
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,079
so the statement you made is not true

705
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,900
across all scenarios

706
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,680
yes so we talk about the two exact

707
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,460
samples in the next presentation I also

708
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,720
more details to describe how efp uipf

709
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,800
feels to prevent the reflection attacks

710
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,079
from provider or from customer

711
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,859
okay

712
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:52,940
okay thank you

713
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,200
um

714
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,820
so um

715
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,900
I think it is stating too much that it's

716
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,780
it's always misaligned incentives uh

717
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,579
there could be cases when incentives are

718
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,300
very much aligned for example

719
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,380
um it did a value that if you can detect

720
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,040
um

721
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,140
attacks from your customer cone and for

722
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,300
example inform them that hey you have

723
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,760
compromise machines

724
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,160
um if your customers are using your AP

725
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,760
space there is value in making sure that

726
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,040
your IP space doesn't get on blacklists

727
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,119
for originating attacks

728
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:36,300
there is also value for even directly to

729
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,880
your customers for example

730
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,880
if they originate if they have

731
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,859
compromised machines in their networks

732
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:46,740
now all of the users can start getting

733
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,160
captures on all the different websites

734
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,540
and preventing that is also value that

735
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,359
is quite aligned so there is value

736
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:05,820
okay we want to uh we acknowledge that

737
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,359
efp or ipf can provide some direct

738
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,619
incentive compared to bcp38 but we want

739
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:14,400
to

740
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,359
a new into the missile maximum should

741
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,200
provide more theoretic detail to help

742
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,720
mitigate reflection attacks and protect

743
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,180
at all directions thank you

744
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,920
[Music]

745
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,740
hi I'm already

746
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,280
um

747
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,859
future Technologies

748
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,980
um if we go to slide 12 I just this is a

749
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,680
individual participant comment

750
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,359
um I think in slide trials where you

751
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:49,740
start talking about some of the

752
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,440
requirements

753
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,760
and um

754
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,339
if we get to the point where we're going

755
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,500
to build

756
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,720
um Solutions based on this we need to be

757
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,859
very specific on what we are requiring

758
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,140
um and many of these

759
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,359
um I don't know what they would be for

760
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,380
example just to pick on one the last one

761
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,420
must not induce much overhead okay

762
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,800
that's great I mean I understand the

763
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,619
general purpose of that but what does

764
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:22,800
that mean as much overhead two packets

765
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,859
10 packets 25 big packets small packets

766
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:27,900
you know what does that mean so we need

767
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,880
to you know quantify some of these

768
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,099
things a little bit better I know this

769
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,440
is the first time that uh this text is

770
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,359
in the drafts I think

771
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:39,060
so if the working group

772
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,460
decides to keep working on this document

773
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,319
that adopts it we're going to want to

774
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:45,300
look at

775
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,800
um you know clarifying these steps right

776
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,660
so that then later we can come back and

777
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,780
say oh look at the solution it meets

778
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,220
that requirement right and so it's easy

779
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,920
to and we're not arguing whether

780
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,440
overhead

781
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,680
is uh much or not much

782
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,960
which is not a very

783
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,220
um

784
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,560
technical term

785
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,180
the other thing that I want to sort of

786
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,220
throw out there

787
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:11,940
um

788
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,280
and this may be

789
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,260
a

790
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,000
longer discussion for the working group

791
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,520
and something that that the chairs

792
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,500
should consider in discussing

793
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,960
is

794
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,700
the charter

795
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,560
specifically says that this working

796
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,540
group is not going to extend

797
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,180
existing mechanisms

798
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,940
right it doesn't say

799
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,560
that the working group is not going to

800
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,880
use

801
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,099
existing mechanisms as part of a bigger

802
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:42,599
solution

803
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,599
so you know some of the arguments about

804
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,460
yes this solution existing solution

805
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,960
solves part of the problem but not all

806
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,060
the problem and uh depending on where

807
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,920
you sit and look at which is some of the

808
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,240
things that's the room was talking about

809
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,720
before you know we need to consider that

810
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,000
and again if we get to the point where

811
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,339
we're going to go build Solutions what

812
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,140
does that mean in the

813
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,839
in the face of existing ones without

814
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:08,640
extending them because that's not in the

815
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,040
charter

816
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,500
can they be used right for for a broader

817
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,000
solution or not

818
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,500
um again just kind of throwing that out

819
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,720
there so that it is discussed as we go

820
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,980
forward thanks

821
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,760
Noland

822
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,579
hi Roland Dobbins Scott Arbor a couple

823
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:35,579
of quick points on the uh misaligned

824
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:37,740
incentive uh discussion first of all it

825
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,119
needs to be acknowledged that there are

826
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,440
in fact

827
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,380
um incentives for some Network operators

828
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,740
to not deploy Source address validation

829
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,900
and those are operators who deliberately

830
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,560
knowingly are actually selling transit

831
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,400
to criminal actors who uh actually have

832
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,500
control of the attack generation

833
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,319
infrastructure to for the um reflection

834
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,300
amplification initiation traffic which

835
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,520
is what is food and also for direct pass

836
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,920
move to tax and so it's important to

837
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,119
understand that there are different

838
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,940
categories of incentives and there are

839
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,000
in fact some incentives for some

840
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,460
operators to not enforce social address

841
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,040
validation on their customers a second

842
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,480
point that I wanted to make sure that

843
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,339
everybody understands is that in terms

844
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,560
of existing mechanisms there's been a

845
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,940
significant push within the operational

846
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,920
community over the last 18 months to

847
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,380
encourage more networking operators to

848
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,480
deploy Source address validation using

849
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,119
existing mechanisms whether it's Europe

850
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,940
whether it's apples and we have observed

851
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,200
a macro level shift in the ddon attack

852
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,420
landscape as a result of that we're

853
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,640
seeing reflection amplification attacks

854
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,160
down across the board for example I can

855
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,359
tell you that DNS reflection

856
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:55,500
amplification attacks are down 31 from

857
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,980
the second half of 2021 and the first

858
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,960
half of 2022 and that's that's true

859
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,300
across the board also in terms of the

860
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,160
direct path attacks where you're seeing

861
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,920
the attack traffic emitted from the bot

862
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,480
or from the attack infrastructure and

863
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,839
just going straight to packet the target

864
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:16,040
we're also seeing spoof direct path

865
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,319
attacks down significantly as well and

866
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:22,020
so it's important to understand that the

867
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,540
incentives the economic incentives both

868
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,940
internally within the perceived economic

869
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,180
system of the operator as well as uh key

870
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,060
externalities can change over time and

871
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,220
it has changed and we're seeing even

872
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,400
more success with existing mechanisms

873
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,599
that are in place today I just want to

874
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,740
make sure that everybody involved in

875
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,359
this discussion is aware of these facts

876
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,779
thank you

877
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,900
so uh video

878
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,400
next uh necessary for the incentive

879
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,700
consideration I think this is the most

880
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,700
important point

881
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,960
okay

882
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,060
now I'm going to introduce soundness

883
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,700
incentive consideration for defense

884
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,040
against reflection attacks

885
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,400
this draft further explains the

886
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,520
misaligned incentive problem of existing

887
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,940
sound mechanisms and clarifies the

888
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,540
direct incentive that sounded hopes to

889
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,960
achieve

890
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,420
when valuable lesson we learned from

891
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:03,180
bcp38 is the importance of direct

892
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,520
incentive for cell deployment

893
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,480
although bcp3h has been proposed for

894
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,260
more than 20 years some ases still do

895
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,339
not deploy dcp3h due to the misled

896
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:21,839
incentive

897
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,200
specifically it only prevents a provider

898
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,359
who deploys that from originating

899
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,319
spoofed traffic but do not protect the

900
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:34,380
provider from being the victim of an

901
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,819
attack

902
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:39,420
therefore to improve the adoption of

903
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,599
Staff the new South mechanism must

904
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:45,540
provide direct incentive

905
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,500
if a network deploys sub but finds that

906
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,859
it only helps other networks the network

907
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:56,640
will not be motivated to deploy itself

908
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,599
if a network deploys staff and finds

909
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,380
that sometimes it can help itself

910
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,720
compared with not deploying the network

911
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,779
will be more motivated to deploy itself

912
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,140
nowadays Source addressed spoofing can

913
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,800
be used in various malicious attacks and

914
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,819
is mainly used in reflection attacks

915
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:30,060
to conduct a reflection attack

916
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,660
and attacker will force the victim's

917
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,800
Source IP address in requests sent to

918
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,780
the reflector server

919
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,500
after you see me the spoofed request the

920
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,020
reflector server will reply to the

921
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,319
victim with a lot of messages

922
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:52,440
therefore preventing reflection attacks

923
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,619
depends on the self filtering on path

924
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:59,760
between the attacker and the reflector

925
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,819
to get protection against reflecting

926
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:06,540
attacks customer or user networks have

927
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,119
incentive to ask their Upstream

928
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,180
providers to deploy stuff to protect

929
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:16,880
their Source addresses from being forged

930
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,619
considering the market demand from

931
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:22,380
customer or user networks Network

932
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,520
operators can improve their

933
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,500
competitiveness by providing defense

934
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,420
against reflection attacks

935
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:39,119
however efp uipf is not real aligned

936
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,839
with the demand it is essentially

937
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:47,280
deploying pcp38 at the top of a custom

938
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,079
code

939
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:52,559
it only validates traffic from customer

940
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,559
interfaces but doesn't validate traffic

941
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:58,859
from provider and the pure interfaces

942
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:03,420
it means that efp uipf only prevents

943
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,660
custom coin from originating spoofed

944
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,260
traffic but doesn't protect the custom

945
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,500
coin from receiving spoof traffic or

946
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,260
being the victim of a reflection attack

947
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,339
from outside customer coins

948
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:25,099
in addition efp uipf a algorithm B even

949
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:28,020
compromises directionality among

950
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,240
customer interfaces

951
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,720
as a result network still suffers

952
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,559
reflection attack you will win it and is

953
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:41,280
Upstream providers have deployed efp

954
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,119
uipf

955
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,260
here we first used an example to

956
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:53,940
illustrate why efp uipf feels to prevent

957
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,400
reflection attack

958
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,660
we simplify the participants in a

959
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,960
reflexive attack into three rules they

960
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,099
are attacked as reflector es and the

961
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:13,380
victim is in this example as1 is the

962
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,599
attacker as as2 is the reflector as and

963
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:23,119
as3 is the victim ES

964
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:27,599
to conduct the reflection attack the

965
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,079
attacker forces the victim's Source IP

966
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,619
address in the spoofed request sent to

967
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:36,319
reflector

968
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:42,119
assume as2 and as3 deploy efp uipf in

969
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,920
this case both efp uipf algorithm a and

970
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,540
efp uipf algorithm B field

971
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:56,099
it is because that efp uipf only works

972
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:00,300
at customer interfaces but next Source

973
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,940
address validation at provider and

974
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,780
appear interfaces therefore es2 will

975
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,559
commit the spoofed request from provider

976
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,559
interfaces and finally the attack

977
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,460
succeeds

978
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,380
this is another example in which ES1 and

979
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:31,220
as3 are both customers of es2

980
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:37,140
similarly ES1 is the attacker as as2 is

981
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:42,059
the reflector es and ES3 is the victim

982
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:44,359
ES

983
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,559
the attacker in as1 will spoof The

984
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:53,940
Source IP address of victim to the to

985
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,619
send a spoof request to the reflector in

986
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:00,900
as2

987
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:07,559
assume es2 and as3 deploy EFT uipf in

988
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:11,579
this case if they apply efp uipf

989
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,980
algorithm a

990
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,180
as2 can successfully block the spoofed

991
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,619
request but if they apply efp uipf

992
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,960
algorithm B

993
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,920
FF to prevent the reflection attack

994
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:34,099
it is because that efp uipf algorithm B

995
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:37,440
compromises directionality among custom

996
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,160
customer interfaces it cannot prevent

997
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,819
asses in the same custom coin from

998
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:47,960
spoofing each other

999
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,000
foreign

1000
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,819
we have defined several requirements for

1001
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:00,540
the new inter-domain sound mechanism in

1002
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,500
the previous presentation

1003
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,500
for the seek of description we

1004
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,099
temporarily name a possible new cell

1005
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:14,339
mechanism as soundnet

1006
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:18,540
since there is no specific or mature

1007
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,140
subnet solution yet we assume cell net

1008
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,420
could meet the following two

1009
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,660
requirements first it could validate

1010
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,880
traffic from all directions

1011
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,880
second it could match the real data

1012
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,640
plane forwarding path originated from

1013
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,180
each deployed it has in this way cell

1014
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:43,260
net would work better than efpu RPF at

1015
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:47,660
defending against reflection attacks

1016
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:55,319
in the previous example where EFT uipf

1017
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:56,760
feels

1018
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:02,180
if in this case as2 and as3 deploy

1019
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:07,920
soundnet subnet could notify as2 of the

1020
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,380
real incoming interface for Source

1021
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,559
addresses of P1

1022
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:18,020
therefore as2 could learn that package

1023
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:22,079
with Source addresses of P1 must come

1024
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,700
from interface 3.

1025
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,400
when es2 receives the spoofed request

1026
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,720
with Source addresses of P1 from as2

1027
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,780
from the provider interface 1

1028
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,260
the spoofed request will be blocked and

1029
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:45,500
the reflex attack is prevented

1030
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,839
in the other example where EFT uipf

1031
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:57,300
algorithm B feels if es2 and as3 deploy

1032
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,559
subnet similarly as2 could learn that

1033
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:05,339
package with Source addresses of P1 must

1034
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:08,640
come from interface 1 or it must come

1035
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,400
from interface 3

1036
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,119
therefore when es2 receives the spoofed

1037
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,859
request with Source addresses of P1 from

1038
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:23,460
interface 2 the spoofed request would be

1039
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,480
blocked and the reflection attack would

1040
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,319
be prevented

1041
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:37,799
next I will propose more reflection

1042
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:41,220
attack scenarios to measure the

1043
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:45,359
incentive that efp uipf or a possible

1044
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:48,900
new sound mechanism can provide to the

1045
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,740
victim Network

1046
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,760
we still use the simplified reflection

1047
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,799
attack example

1048
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:03,240
but with enumerate multiple attack

1049
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,180
scenarios by changing the relative

1050
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,900
positions of the three rules in a

1051
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,140
reflection attack

1052
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:15,540
assume the victim Network always deploy

1053
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,960
sound mechanism because only the victim

1054
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,900
Network benefits from the defense

1055
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,780
against reflection attacks

1056
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,319
then for any deploying cases of the

1057
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,859
other two networks we check whether the

1058
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,980
reflection attack can be prevented if so

1059
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:38,579
the victim can be motivated to deploy

1060
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:41,940
itself if not the victim cannot benefit

1061
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:45,540
from deploying staff

1062
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,540
in scenario number one where the

1063
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,660
reflector network is located on path

1064
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,240
between attacker networks and victim

1065
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,660
Network for all deployment cases we

1066
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:03,119
found subnet could work in the 75 cases

1067
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,559
while efp uipf air algorithm a Works in

1068
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:13,079
30 cases EFT uipf algorithm B Works in

1069
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:16,020
20 cases

1070
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,079
in scenario number two where the victim

1071
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:21,960
networks is located on path between

1072
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,099
attacker Network and reflect a network

1073
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:29,819
for all deployment cases we found some

1074
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:34,799
net could work in 100 cases while efp

1075
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:39,180
uipf a algorithm a and algorithm B work

1076
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:43,098
in 60 cases

1077
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,020
a scenario number three

1078
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,440
where the attack network is located on

1079
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,720
path between victim Network and

1080
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,660
reflector Network for all deployment

1081
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,260
cases we find none of them could prevent

1082
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:01,920
the attack it is because South Fields

1083
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,579
when victims Source address shares the

1084
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,220
same incoming interface with the

1085
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,799
attacker Source addressed in the South

1086
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,220
world

1087
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:17,160
in summary for any attack scenarios or

1088
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,980
deployment Keys we find that soundnet

1089
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,740
could work better or not worse than efp

1090
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:26,220
uipf therefore a network could have more

1091
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,099
essential to deploy soundnet as the

1092
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:31,799
sound mechanism because it would have

1093
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:34,680
higher probability of Defending against

1094
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:39,078
reflection attacks thank you

1095
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:42,079
yes

1096
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,640
hey Lauren you are

1097
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,200
okay

1098
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,260
guess hi uh a couple of uh comments uh

1099
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,540
here uh first of all there is a an

1100
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,400
overemphasis on reflection amplification

1101
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,440
and an under emphasis on direct pass

1102
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,880
boost attacks and I think that that's

1103
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,740
something that we need to address

1104
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:11,160
throughout all the documentation uh and

1105
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,339
and discussion here about the problem of

1106
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:16,619
smooth traffic in general secondly there

1107
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:18,720
is insufficient differentiation between

1108
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,900
the spoofed attack initiator traffic and

1109
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,420
the Amplified attack traffic you know

1110
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,099
the Amplified attack traffic is actually

1111
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:28,319
not spoofed on the leg from the

1112
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,780
reflectors amplifiers to the targets and

1113
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,400
I know most of the folks involved in

1114
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,900
this discussion understand that but I

1115
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,819
think that it needs to be uh clearly

1116
01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:37,859
documented thirdly

1117
01:02:37,859 --> 01:02:39,540
um I I wanted folks to understand that

1118
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,819
we're increasingly seeing uh attacks

1119
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:44,220
where uh attackers who can in fact

1120
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,200
launch reflection amplification attacks

1121
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,059
are deliberately choosing reflectors

1122
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:51,000
amplifiers that are topologically cited

1123
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,220
near the Target because the fewer

1124
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,540
administrative boundaries that the

1125
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,640
Amplified attack traffic has to be

1126
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,160
traversed provides fewer opportunities

1127
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,319
for detection and classification Trace

1128
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:05,460
back and mitigation another I guess this

1129
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,880
is almost a question to my knowledge efp

1130
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,180
or PF hasn't actually been implemented

1131
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,099
in any any routing Hardware at least in

1132
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:17,220
my knowledge and I personally don't know

1133
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,619
of any operators who's actually deployed

1134
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:22,200
it and so I'm a little bit puzzled by

1135
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,619
seeing these statistical comparisons of

1136
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:28,020
efp RPF which at least has been

1137
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,640
specified but to my knowledge has never

1138
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,859
been deployed and then some assertions

1139
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:33,960
about savnet which hasn't even been

1140
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,900
fully defined so I'm kind of confused by

1141
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,480
this and perhaps the previous speaker

1142
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,059
can help clarify that that's all I had

1143
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:43,559
thank you

1144
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:49,440
uh yes uh as far as I know efp uipf has

1145
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,799
not been implemented in existing routers

1146
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:56,940
maybe eager can could clarify the

1147
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:00,960
deployment for efpu ipf so we are

1148
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,280
talking about the technique technical

1149
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,799
analysis between EF View ipf and the

1150
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:11,339
7net so there is

1151
01:04:11,339 --> 01:04:15,119
no mature solution yet and we just

1152
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,940
assume a possible sound mechanism could

1153
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:22,260
meet the requirements we proposed

1154
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,240
yeah I don't think this is actually a

1155
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,400
technical analysis I think that this is

1156
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,859
a theoretical hypothetical

1157
01:04:28,859 --> 01:04:32,460
um sort of um positing of of uh some

1158
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,140
opinions it's not really based in fact

1159
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,420
thank you okay thank you

1160
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,400
so I think uh

1161
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,500
uh

1162
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,079
open discussion for the for the schedule

1163
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,900
so I think uh we can't continue we can

1164
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:58,440
also begin the open discussion about the

1165
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,540
periods would be cut to five minutes

1166
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,839
okay

1167
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,480
your turn okay yeah you can call me

1168
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,740
sriram

1169
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:23,540
um

1170
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:27,359
I have a quick comment for you uh or a

1171
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,180
request for you before I go to my

1172
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,960
question uh I put a request in the chat

1173
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,200
box for you to share pointers to the

1174
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,319
work that you were mentioning earlier

1175
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:43,020
um about uh measurements that show that

1176
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:46,020
the Adidas attacks have reduced because

1177
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:50,579
of the deployment of uh uh urpf

1178
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,660
Etc I would appreciate that

1179
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,500
thank you

1180
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,720
thank you

1181
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,780
um so um can you go to slide seven

1182
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,859
please

1183
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:03,920
um

1184
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,380
seven

1185
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,619
yeah so one thing to note here is that

1186
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:15,780
uh if as1 as1 is a provider of as2 and

1187
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,299
the attack is assuming that attack is

1188
01:06:18,299 --> 01:06:20,819
not originating from as1 itself because

1189
01:06:20,819 --> 01:06:24,059
it's a provider uh it is originating

1190
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:28,079
from a customer of as1 and if you deploy

1191
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,619
the search technique your EF erpf or or

1192
01:06:31,619 --> 01:06:34,140
whichever one is best on the customer

1193
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:37,740
side of as1 that is where that attack is

1194
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,680
most successfully prevented because you

1195
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,559
cannot move up the chain of customer to

1196
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:46,440
provider and try to implement

1197
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,740
um these techniques as a very

1198
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:53,880
effectively at the higher levels in the

1199
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,039
higher hierarchy so what you have to do

1200
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:58,200
is you look back down towards the

1201
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,260
customer cone again from as1 down to

1202
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:05,339
into its customer cone and if the sav

1203
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:07,920
mechanisms are implemented they there

1204
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,319
then the attack is prevented in the cust

1205
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:17,039
even like it's not successfully emerging

1206
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,000
out of as1 to proceed towards as2 so so

1207
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,760
that's something that to keep in mind uh

1208
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,339
and as you move higher in in the

1209
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:29,099
hierarchy uh in in the customer provider

1210
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:31,920
chain what happens is that uh it it

1211
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,920
becomes uh I mean it becomes less

1212
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,039
effective uh you have to uh I mean

1213
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:41,160
unless you do a lot of things uh uh

1214
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,380
additional a lot of additional overhead

1215
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,960
unless you do that what happens is that

1216
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:49,079
at the higher levels in the hierarchy it

1217
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:51,599
is harder to implement it it is harder

1218
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,660
to achieve the objective of

1219
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:55,859
directionality that you have been

1220
01:07:55,859 --> 01:07:58,380
talking about you would have to sort of

1221
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:02,940
resort to a feasible uh uh yeah a loose

1222
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:06,359
urpf for example uh it becomes harder to

1223
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:08,880
implement a achieve a good sense of

1224
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,819
directionality at that level because uh

1225
01:08:13,819 --> 01:08:17,520
yeah basically because the uh the the

1226
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,339
complexity is higher uh the customer

1227
01:08:20,339 --> 01:08:23,819
cone is much larger uh and the and there

1228
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:25,738
are difficulties with the implementation

1229
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:27,779
of course at that level but at the lower

1230
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:30,120
levels if you implement it on both sides

1231
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,359
not on the not only on the on the on the

1232
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,420
customer side of of

1233
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:39,420
as2 as3 but also on the other side of

1234
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:42,299
as1 where the traffic is then then it

1235
01:08:42,299 --> 01:08:44,759
then these things work much better so

1236
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:46,920
that's one comment

1237
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,759
um

1238
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:51,920
if you have I can pause

1239
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,920
yes to achieve accurate style at

1240
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,979
provider interface is much more

1241
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:05,698
difficult than a TV accurate style at

1242
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:10,439
customer interface yes but uh

1243
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:13,160
I see

1244
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:18,000
8704 it recommends to deploy loose uipf

1245
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,299
at provider and the pr interfaces and

1246
01:09:21,299 --> 01:09:25,799
deploy efp uipf air algorithm B add

1247
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:27,899
customer interfaces

1248
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:31,679
but to simplify the menu configuration

1249
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,580
overhead for deploying sound uh is

1250
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:39,420
required to we need one mechanism that

1251
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,319
can validate traffic from all directions

1252
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,359
uh instead of applying different stuff

1253
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,040
at different directions right

1254
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,140
besides we should pay more attention to

1255
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,000
South at provider or pure interfaces

1256
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,739
yes

1257
01:09:57,739 --> 01:10:03,120
is a difficult task but it is a really

1258
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,580
necessary requirement and it is

1259
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:09,739
Meaningful is worth doing

1260
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:13,560
yeah and my other question is uh like

1261
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,500
Roland pointed out what you are

1262
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,900
describing here is savnet you haven't

1263
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,920
described uh what savnet is perhaps you

1264
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,040
are referring to the another one I think

1265
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,920
that is the architecture document

1266
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,380
um so so at this point I think it is

1267
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:34,440
still uh like a continuation of the

1268
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,640
requirements uh how efp or PF or other

1269
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,820
urpf don't meet the requirements how and

1270
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:45,540
how uh the the new requirements for

1271
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:48,780
savnet will overcome uh the limitations

1272
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:51,659
of the previous methods uh so I think

1273
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:53,520
that's what you are doing here but but

1274
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,100
you don't really have a solution that

1275
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,840
you can call savnet at this point uh

1276
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,920
unless you are referring to the another

1277
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,840
document that is the architecture

1278
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,739
document so I would I will be careful to

1279
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:09,540
say that there is this solution and it

1280
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:14,300
performs forms better than efp urpf

1281
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,739
yeah nah okay

1282
01:11:22,219 --> 01:11:25,880
from our technology

1283
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:29,040
so this document some something about

1284
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,760
this document uh this is a supporting

1285
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,560
director and uh is uh temporary so it

1286
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,420
should

1287
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,640
incentive is a whole topic on how many

1288
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,659
discussions in the mailing list so we

1289
01:11:44,659 --> 01:11:49,219
have a desire to make a individual draft

1290
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:52,020
actually it should be included in the

1291
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,440
inter domain problem statement crafter

1292
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:58,860
and the traveler is actually a technical

1293
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,500
analysis

1294
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,440
result presents some technical analysis

1295
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:09,020
results uh way to an auto give some

1296
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:13,020
implementations and something may be

1297
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,000
misleading in the presentation something

1298
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,640
that is not a solution maybe two more uh

1299
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,420
Solutions like information

1300
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,739
is provided in the present Edition

1301
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:28,440
actually there is a normal pool some

1302
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,739
United Center can perform a candidate

1303
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:34,520
already requirement in the

1304
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,980
previous problem statement after

1305
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:41,000
okay that's all

1306
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:52,199
so let's begin the second part of for

1307
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:55,140
the serenade architecture so before we

1308
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:57,000
introduce the into our internal domain

1309
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,120
architecture for the author will like to

1310
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,300
introduce the cell type of service table

1311
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,060
architecture for the discussion of the

1312
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:09,679
next tools like okay

1313
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,260
so I can change the slide really quiet

1314
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,100
okay

1315
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,940
okay hello yeah hello everyone uh glad

1316
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,179
to give our presentation here uh this

1317
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:24,659
chapter is another solution draft uh we

1318
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:27,360
will describe abstractly the social

1319
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,699
surprise validation and

1320
01:13:29,699 --> 01:13:34,440
some typical validation modes so that we

1321
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:38,100
can uh easily to understand which kind

1322
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,739
of offers ISO weight table can be

1323
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:44,219
generated or used in different scenarios

1324
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,679
size please

1325
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:49,860
so why there is such a document isolate

1326
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,659
tables are used for filtering specific

1327
01:13:51,659 --> 01:13:54,600
social prefixes and they can be

1328
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,080
generated manually or automatically in

1329
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,239
the data plane they are implemented by

1330
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:04,260
SL office or some other resources it's

1331
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,179
important for engineers and

1332
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,260
operators to understand which kind of

1333
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,400
associatables should be used in

1334
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,760
particular scenarios but existing so

1335
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,400
mechanisms have their own data

1336
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,620
structures these data structures are

1337
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,580
coupled with corresponding underlying

1338
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:28,620
implementations and there is no unified

1339
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:32,640
data structure in for the SOA table in

1340
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,300
different scenarios the levels for

1341
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,760
validation accuracy and the validation

1342
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,179
strictness are different so it's not

1343
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:44,340
easy for us to understand which kind of

1344
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:46,980
isolutable can be generated or implement

1345
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:50,760
or enabled in the data plane and finally

1346
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,580
for validated packages we may take

1347
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,820
either or permit action or Block action

1348
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:59,159
but sometimes those actions are not

1349
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:02,059
available

1350
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:20,100
ISO weight table and any existing tables

1351
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,460
can be expressed by this abstraction uh

1352
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,920
based on the abstraction we describe the

1353
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,679
four typical validation modes and as

1354
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:32,460
well as their application conditions uh

1355
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,500
finally we'll start using multiple

1356
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,719
actions for different operations

1357
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,360
requirements

1358
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,300
this router can help Engineers to make

1359
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,540
the design goals clear to have them did

1360
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:49,320
is a new isoa mechanisms to improve the

1361
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,960
existing

1362
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,760
designs and they can also provide

1363
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,060
guidance to operators to tell them which

1364
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,820
kind of

1365
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,739
tables can be used in particular

1366
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:03,360
Networks

1367
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,940
next please

1368
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:09,960
this is the isolated abstractor is very

1369
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,179
simple

1370
01:16:11,179 --> 01:16:15,540
for any kind of isolatables we will

1371
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:19,199
check whether or Source prefix arrives

1372
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,840
from a validate interface so there are

1373
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,120
two dimensions in the SQL table there

1374
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,159
are Source prefix and the interface

1375
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,659
respectively

1376
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:30,360
any existing is waitable generating

1377
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,400
mechanisms

1378
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,420
is to fill this table in the table each

1379
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:40,080
cell indicates the validity state of a

1380
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,060
pair of source prefix and the interface

1381
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,179
the state can be

1382
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:47,460
valid invalid or unknown so more

1383
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:50,460
complicated the table is the more strict

1384
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:53,699
the validation is and the more accurate

1385
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:57,420
the table is the less improper block and

1386
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,480
improper permit there will be

1387
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,960
and there is only one isolated table

1388
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:07,080
abstraction in this document on one

1389
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,739
device next please

1390
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:13,920
or we can configure Excel rules to do

1391
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,600
Ingress filtering at different

1392
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,300
interfaces and we

1393
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,840
we can easily express this kind of

1394
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,520
isolate table by using the describe the

1395
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,260
expert table abstraction under another

1396
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,840
example of full strictly RPF can be

1397
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,440
found in the backup slides as this

1398
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,420
uh

1399
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:41,340
okay what can we do uh you by using the

1400
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,860
abstract I swear table we Define some

1401
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,699
typical validation modes that

1402
01:17:46,699 --> 01:17:49,440
describes the typical value station

1403
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:53,159
procedures uh why do we need this most

1404
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:56,400
why do we Define these modes in

1405
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,500
different application scenarios

1406
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:03,380
uh the Suva tables may have different

1407
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,360
levels of accuracy and validation

1408
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,040
strictness so we Define some

1409
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:13,260
validation modes that are suitable to

1410
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,719
different scenarios

1411
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:19,620
and uh decimals can help us to easily

1412
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,780
understand which kind of vegetable can

1413
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,540
be generated under input and enabled in

1414
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,760
the data plan

1415
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,400
uh there are four validation modes

1416
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,159
module one is interface-based prefix on

1417
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:35,460
our list we are very familiar with this

1418
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,219
mode uh most of the existing activities

1419
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:41,400
are try to generating accurate terms

1420
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,840
or isolate table under mode one

1421
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,360
this model is used a full circle in

1422
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,620
great filtering

1423
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:52,080
if we want to use Mode web

1424
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,480
we need to learn the complete set of

1425
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:58,440
source prefix that may allow at the the

1426
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,380
kindergarten interface and the mode 2 is

1427
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:05,100
interface-based prefix block list if if

1428
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,679
we are sure some prefix are not invalid

1429
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,960
for this interface we can put them into

1430
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,600
the block list

1431
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,520
and the business model and more tool

1432
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,280
will have mode 3 and mode 4. they are

1433
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,500
prefix based interface on our list and

1434
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,960
the prefix is the block list

1435
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,860
uh actually the that are similar so

1436
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:29,040
let's talk about the model 3 only most

1437
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,500
trade is less considered in the existing

1438
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:36,480
Sue mechanisms uh if we want to protect

1439
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,060
the specific Source prefix we can use

1440
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:42,719
modestly or model 4.

1441
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:46,320
and if we cannot obtain the complete set

1442
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,659
of those prefix we can also use this

1443
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:54,000
mode so uh effect yes by choosing uh

1444
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,480
different modes in the suitable

1445
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,699
application scenarios we can provide as

1446
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:02,760
much protection as possible

1447
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,280
next please

1448
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,340
well the procedure is simple we will

1449
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,739
look at Apple I swear table in specific

1450
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:13,860
mode by using as social address and the

1451
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:16,020
incoming interface and we get validity

1452
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:21,500
state next uh thanks

1453
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:28,400
yeah

1454
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,800
there are many available actions

1455
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,980
that can be picked for the validator

1456
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,040
package

1457
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,659
that there are permission block already

1458
01:20:39,659 --> 01:20:43,440
limiting or sampling UFO invalid even

1459
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,719
for the package with invalid State we

1460
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:48,540
can use permeate block really limiting

1461
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:52,199
and sampling actions to do we can use

1462
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:54,239
sampling actions to do further analysis

1463
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,820
for example yes there are for meeting

1464
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,400
interest value operation requirements

1465
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:03,019
okay that's all thanks

1466
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,739
for one more word uh let's drop it

1467
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:09,719
doesn't focus on how to generate and

1468
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:11,940
implement the sway table

1469
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:16,020
yeah it's a supporting craft

1470
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,920
okay hear it

1471
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:21,800
shared much

1472
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,840
uh so if you go back I I think it was

1473
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,000
one slide where you're talking about

1474
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,800
um you know the potential to You Know

1475
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,940
sample

1476
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:32,400
the packet you know or even rate limit

1477
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,179
them or something uh no move forward

1478
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:38,460
um you know but it

1479
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,440
you know this is something that many of

1480
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,480
The Operators are already doing is

1481
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,860
they're actually you know they're

1482
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:46,380
already collecting data through either

1483
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:50,420
netflow ipfix or S flow based collectors

1484
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:54,659
to go and uh Trace back

1485
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,400
um when there are spoof packets on their

1486
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,199
Network

1487
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:01,860
but I'm also struggling a little bit in

1488
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:04,440
in a multi-tenant environment so if I

1489
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,679
have a you know an L3 VPN

1490
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,560
uh you know type of environment you know

1491
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,520
I may not know all of the source

1492
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,679
IP addresses that are valid in that

1493
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:19,560
entire environment so are you talking

1494
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,719
here about having all the all the

1495
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:24,060
routing protocols and all the Affy

1496
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:27,719
staffies and vpns contribute to this Sav

1497
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:29,940
table

1498
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:33,600
uh thanks Jared uh yeah it's an

1499
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,000
interesting question uh the answer is no

1500
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,420
wait wait wait don't uh assume that the

1501
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,520
other routine protocols will work for

1502
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,699
some net yeah or we just said that we

1503
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:45,500
can

1504
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,760
take a sampling action into

1505
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,100
consideration because it will help us to

1506
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,640
analysis where the texts come from so

1507
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,400
that we can do better Ingress filtering

1508
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,640
or yeah but but one of the things you

1509
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,500
need to do is to make sure that if I

1510
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,500
have ibgp for example you know I need to

1511
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,719
make sure that that contributing you

1512
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,900
know slash 128 or slash 32 route

1513
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,120
gets into the South table so I don't

1514
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,120
drop the source packet of the bgp

1515
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,900
session in my igp so you you do need to

1516
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,420
go and create a contributing table out

1517
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,920
of all of

1518
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:25,080
uh you know all of the routing protocols

1519
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,540
involved and if we're going to try and

1520
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:30,420
describe how to you know hear where

1521
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:32,100
you're talking about some of the

1522
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,560
prefixes are known all of the prefixes

1523
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,659
are known and some are known and some

1524
01:23:36,659 --> 01:23:37,920
are unknown

1525
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,020
we need to have a way to take all of

1526
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,480
those connected interfaces

1527
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,380
that may be assigned from a provider an

1528
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,659
internet exchange point you know for

1529
01:23:48,659 --> 01:23:50,580
peering or something like that that is a

1530
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:52,340
valid source address for a packet

1531
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:55,500
especially like uh you know an exception

1532
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,920
packet like a icmp error or TTL expire

1533
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,920
or or something like that we need to

1534
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,679
ensure that all of those

1535
01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:08,640
are still flow through these Networks

1536
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,460
um and are not dropped because that is

1537
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,980
important operational information that's

1538
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,320
needed to debug the networks when there

1539
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,360
is a problem so we do need to make sure

1540
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,239
that there is some way to contribute

1541
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,739
from those other routing protocols to

1542
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:24,719
build really what we're talking about

1543
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,179
it's a superset list from multiple data

1544
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:28,920
sources

1545
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,219
yeah thanks uh yeah we're just provide

1546
01:24:32,219 --> 01:24:35,520
some options for the validation modes we

1547
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,900
must classify which model can be used

1548
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:44,840
in the Target networks so we give some

1549
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:48,000
application suggestions in the draft

1550
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,440
yeah

1551
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,360
thanks

1552
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,000
okay thanks

1553
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,580
to the

1554
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:58,560
yeah we have no time for the for for

1555
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,179
discussion we must move to the next

1556
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:01,260
partition

1557
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:03,679
okay

1558
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,640
okay

1559
01:25:31,699 --> 01:25:36,480
can you help me okay yeah uh I think a

1560
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,040
little little closer to the back okay

1561
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,659
oh okay

1562
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:45,960
um my controller slide yeah you can

1563
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,400
control

1564
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,299
oh okay

1565
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,980
offline

1566
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:19,519
so

1567
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,400
right

1568
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,400
now can you eat nah can you introduce

1569
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,639
the oh okay okay he returned to the

1570
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:38,360
meeting okay

1571
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:42,440
okay

1572
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:47,059
uh controller slide now

1573
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:00,260
foreign

1574
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,440
I

1575
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:32,460
I I have a keyword control for it to you

1576
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:33,840
okay

1577
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,719
you can't control the slide

1578
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:39,120
oh is it gonna work for me I think

1579
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,179
I think okay I I work hard okay

1580
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:42,960
um

1581
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,600
let's start now

1582
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,679
um

1583
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,360
this is the phone call from Jungle

1584
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:51,659
International in Beijing the topic of my

1585
01:27:51,659 --> 01:27:53,760
presentation today is about architecture

1586
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,340
of internment satellite I will introduce

1587
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:58,320
this in the following three aspects

1588
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,600
goals and the requirements analyzing

1589
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,540
some like flow and the effect of Supply

1590
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:05,340
implementation

1591
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,440
I did the first beginning let's have a

1592
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,600
review about the gaps or problems of

1593
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,420
existing into them itself negatively for

1594
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,520
the urpf it have the limitation on

1595
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,739
celerio which is produced at the

1596
01:28:16,739 --> 01:28:18,900
improper block and the asymmetrical

1597
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:21,179
routine scenario and it also have the

1598
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:23,639
limitation on the directions it cannot

1599
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:25,620
cover the smooth traffic confirmed

1600
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,780
outside the As and come from the

1601
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:30,780
uncapable or undeployed age routers on

1602
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:33,360
the other hand ACL based increase as

1603
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,340
filtering seems walkable and more

1604
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:37,980
cellulose or technical but it need

1605
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,560
continues and complex menu configuration

1606
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,620
to Cable accuracy

1607
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,500
so if some men want to resolve all these

1608
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,620
issues the following functions need to

1609
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:51,920
be considering or provided

1610
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,620
for the perspective of accuracy Supply

1611
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:58,560
needs to obtain completely social prefix

1612
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,199
in the mighty homie solution and

1613
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:05,100
identify accurate interfaces in the

1614
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,380
asymmetric routine scenario just like

1615
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,300
the PBR or even the different

1616
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,880
bi-directional HP codes to design I

1617
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,940
think all of those are some popular and

1618
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:16,739
ordinary deployment in most of

1619
01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:19,440
commercial networks and for the aspect

1620
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,620
of Direction Sublime need to try to

1621
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:25,139
support validated traffic from all the

1622
01:29:25,139 --> 01:29:27,540
directions if it could work and more

1623
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,639
routers you don't have it will have the

1624
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:32,100
chance to protect the subwoofing traffic

1625
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,219
as close to the source as possible and

1626
01:29:35,219 --> 01:29:37,560
could have the chance to block the

1627
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,540
suburbing traffic from outside of the as

1628
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:43,139
on the other hand providing a approach

1629
01:29:43,139 --> 01:29:46,020
to generate some rules dynamically is

1630
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:48,600
also important goals under requirement

1631
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,060
as it could help to make the maintenance

1632
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,820
course to be affordable and the correct

1633
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:56,940
seven rules according to changes in the

1634
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,860
real time

1635
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:03,480
so we want to make all those goals the

1636
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,940
key idea of sublight is to try to

1637
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:08,460
generate an independent and accurate

1638
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:11,040
subtitle on each router which follows

1639
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,159
the related plane exactly its Discovery

1640
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,920
the related platform in parts we are

1641
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,199
hoped by hope notification and then

1642
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,719
generate some rules hope I hope along

1643
01:30:21,719 --> 01:30:25,020
the path after some rules generated on

1644
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,300
the deadline

1645
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:30,000
we have a diagram figures showing how it

1646
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,940
process when a package comes in before

1647
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:35,540
it look up the field table

1648
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:38,639
button pattern destination IP address

1649
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:42,540
the source address will be validated in

1650
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:45,360
the subtable there are the seven rules

1651
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,840
and um through this new procedure it can

1652
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,940
support validated package received from

1653
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:53,340
all directions and the protect the

1654
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,440
source profits of the deployed error

1655
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,260
from be forged

1656
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,840
okay I will show you the overall

1657
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,840
architecture

1658
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:06,120
through the diagram on the right side

1659
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,400
there are two components on the control

1660
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,679
plane

1661
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:13,199
Sapa and SPD both of them are targeted

1662
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:15,540
to generate self growth on a data plane

1663
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:18,000
and each one have accuracy bounding

1664
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,600
protocol message the first component on

1665
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,300
control plane is the spa Source prefix

1666
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:27,659
advertisement it has three tasks and

1667
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:30,179
first they need to obtain completely so

1668
01:31:30,179 --> 01:31:32,820
local Source prefix then it will support

1669
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:35,760
to generate seven rules on the Ingress

1670
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,580
interface of each each routers then

1671
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:42,239
support SPD to generate some rules by

1672
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:44,580
provided resource prefix their Spa

1673
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:45,600
messages

1674
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,320
they mentioned the SPD just now sapd is

1675
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,840
the second component on control plane we

1676
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,600
call it as an Source pass Discovery it

1677
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,940
will identify the accurate incoming

1678
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:59,460
interface for Source prefixes by

1679
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:02,219
discovering the real data plane 40 parts

1680
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:04,920
then generate some rules

1681
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,920
on network to network interface of each

1682
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,699
intermediate routers

1683
01:32:10,699 --> 01:32:14,580
here through this new mechanism sounds

1684
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:17,219
like we are trying to apply in more

1685
01:32:17,219 --> 01:32:19,980
scenario of the real life work and on

1686
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:23,340
all directions whatever is the impact or

1687
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:25,860
outbound traffic and with an automatic

1688
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:30,179
manner for generated sub rules

1689
01:32:30,179 --> 01:32:31,739
okay

1690
01:32:31,739 --> 01:32:34,500
um in the following tonight I will

1691
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,780
expand on the co-op flow of the

1692
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:40,020
satellite and show how it works in each

1693
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:43,639
step by some examples

1694
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:49,040
the first step is sp8

1695
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:53,520
record Target of the Sapa is to obtain

1696
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,460
the completely solved prefix

1697
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,440
let's take a look at the figure on right

1698
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:02,040
each router in the domain will conduct

1699
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:05,159
as an orange return and lungs is also

1700
01:33:05,159 --> 01:33:07,560
prefix to all other routers in the

1701
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:10,500
domain by the spa messaging under the

1702
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:13,139
sapn receiving router will generate a

1703
01:33:13,139 --> 01:33:15,840
table to store the relationship between

1704
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,719
the orange root ID and the source prefix

1705
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:20,820
belongs to each

1706
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:24,000
it's just as shown in the bottom left if

1707
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,400
something sounds not so complex I want

1708
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,820
to highlight here in the my homies may

1709
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:31,440
take a look at the root value and the

1710
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:34,320
rooted 2 for example a tag mechanism

1711
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,420
will be adopted here for the source

1712
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:38,880
prefix synchronization between these two

1713
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,380
routers

1714
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:43,500
a tech value either identified of the

1715
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:47,040
same consumer and it is taken in the

1716
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,040
Sapa message it will identify the source

1717
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,380
prefix and the interface belongs to the

1718
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:55,080
same consumer and have to go to the

1719
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,960
computer source prefix for the two

1720
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,719
routers and the interface pair

1721
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:05,219
next after Spa procedure let's take a

1722
01:34:05,219 --> 01:34:07,380
look at what what happened in the

1723
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:10,679
subtable of the age routers about the

1724
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:12,659
serverless generation of the Ingress

1725
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:15,900
interface basically take them some table

1726
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,620
of root one and Rule 2 for example and

1727
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:22,260
it's autonomy bottom left

1728
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:27,179
the record in the black color is the

1729
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:29,340
source prefix comes from the local

1730
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:32,340
information so it's the signal since

1731
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:35,280
with the current submachry zip but the

1732
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,520
record with green color is the source

1733
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,219
prefix achieved by Spa synchronization

1734
01:34:41,219 --> 01:34:45,179
and just this new green record well that

1735
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:48,179
is true avoid improper Block in the Dual

1736
01:34:48,179 --> 01:34:51,960
homine cellular and that is definitely

1737
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:55,440
one of the reason why adopt a mechanism

1738
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,440
of a corporate between routers and

1739
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,659
counter plane

1740
01:35:00,659 --> 01:35:04,139
okay then let's go to the next step it's

1741
01:35:04,139 --> 01:35:08,400
a source pass Discovery SPD plus CU SPD

1742
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,460
procedure is Task 2 generate some rules

1743
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:14,219
on the intermediate routers and the

1744
01:35:14,219 --> 01:35:17,580
network to network interfaces the main

1745
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:22,080
idea of spt is neglect each routers send

1746
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,719
the sapd message on a preferred pass

1747
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,520
according to the real data plane

1748
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,739
information then the receiving return

1749
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:30,719
notice the incoming interface and

1750
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:33,420
funding this with the source profits and

1751
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,940
generate some rules on the date plane

1752
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:40,320
actually SPD is um operated Group which

1753
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:43,440
consists with three sub steps we look at

1754
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,020
the figure on the right this time we

1755
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:49,380
take the root 3 for example

1756
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:52,860
unit 3 will generate a orange spt

1757
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:53,940
message

1758
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:58,620
for the prefix of P1 and P2 on the left

1759
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:02,360
to the next hope group six

1760
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:07,020
after the receiving sap team message

1761
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:10,199
from root 3 it will generate um some

1762
01:36:10,199 --> 01:36:12,300
rules according to the incoming

1763
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,940
interface at first then execute the

1764
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:18,600
remaining operator to operation to the

1765
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,760
received SPD message

1766
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:24,540
then it will going to the next hope of

1767
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:28,020
root 5. out of the five operation is the

1768
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,659
similar with Root 6 so we are we will

1769
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:34,759
repeat here and go ahead

1770
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:38,699
at last the SPD message arrived at reach

1771
01:36:38,699 --> 01:36:42,120
the last node of the destination P1 and

1772
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:45,360
P2 the root 1 and root 2 will generate

1773
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,639
sub rows at first according to the

1774
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:50,520
incoming interface then execute

1775
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:53,340
determination to the received SPD

1776
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,139
messages

1777
01:36:55,139 --> 01:36:58,139
and here now the whole spt procedure is

1778
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:00,900
done and some rules generated on each

1779
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:03,659
hop of the whole spt pumps

1780
01:37:03,659 --> 01:37:06,300
I want to highlight here is that in

1781
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:08,239
order

1782
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,739
accuracy of that incoming interface

1783
01:37:10,739 --> 01:37:14,340
during the four SPD procedure all

1784
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:16,800
factors that influence the volume Parts

1785
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,920
just negatively performing or PPR we are

1786
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,020
determine the directions and outgoing

1787
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:25,800
interface of the sap message on each hub

1788
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,360
okay that's all of the co-op flow and

1789
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:33,719
they have a quick summary again it is

1790
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:36,719
the benefit achieved by sublet and

1791
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,300
comparing with the existing star

1792
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:43,320
magnitude we look at the diagram again

1793
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,840
by this new mechanism some light can

1794
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,600
apply to more Solarium just connect to

1795
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,219
the 1.1

1796
01:37:50,219 --> 01:37:52,860
money homie and 1.2 or symmetrical

1797
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:55,560
routine and the supply can protect

1798
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,800
deployed errors from spoofing attack on

1799
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,520
all directions just make the 2.1 for the

1800
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,440
swimming traffic come from outside the

1801
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:07,560
As and 2.2 for the subwoofing traffic

1802
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:10,380
comes from the uncapable or antipolar

1803
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:13,139
deployed 80 routers and the third is

1804
01:38:13,139 --> 01:38:15,000
that the sublime can generate some rules

1805
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,199
dynamically which well reduced maintain

1806
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:22,678
his cost okay

1807
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,980
we are focused on the workflow

1808
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:28,320
considering most of the people were

1809
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,600
interested with the convergency and the

1810
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,820
partial deployment scenes so I simply

1811
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:36,000
missed some design principle of them

1812
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,580
here for the convergency the principle

1813
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:42,060
is balancing performance and overhead so

1814
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,159
it will be first new sub rules

1815
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:46,980
installing and snow some rules removing

1816
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:51,300
the best mechanism for convergency is a

1817
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,820
mixture of periodical updating and aging

1818
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:56,820
time experiencing if we want to fast the

1819
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,460
convergency a trigger updating mechanism

1820
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:03,900
or backup sub rules preparation in the

1821
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:06,480
if I asked celerio is also could be

1822
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,400
adopt

1823
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,040
and for incremental deployment the

1824
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,620
principal leader to con concerned about

1825
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:16,800
the device capability and the igp arrow

1826
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,460
design it isn't recommend to deploy from

1827
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,920
the higher ability device and

1828
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:25,199
aggregation or core layer and the

1829
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:29,400
backbone area of the ATP and then it

1830
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,800
expands to the lower capability device

1831
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:35,100
access nail and no backbone error of the

1832
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:39,060
ICP going to be step by step uh it's

1833
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:41,880
just some simple principle here we can

1834
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,800
have further discussing

1835
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:46,199
um offline and Marine list

1836
01:39:46,199 --> 01:39:49,920
okay is the final summary we mentioned

1837
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,139
the goals of introdomen subnet and an

1838
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:54,120
architecture of into domain Sublime

1839
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:57,360
which is consisted by spa and sapd

1840
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,880
procedure on control plane and the

1841
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,159
subtable in the display

1842
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:04,560
um Advanced the architecture is protocol

1843
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,960
independent extension of the routing

1844
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,900
protocol are not focused and mentions in

1845
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:12,840
today's document okay that's all about

1846
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,100
the topic

1847
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,080
thank you for listening and welcome to

1848
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,739
your comments

1849
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:21,960
okay London

1850
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:24,540
I think because the time is critical so

1851
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:28,739
we must make a comment uh every

1852
01:40:28,739 --> 01:40:29,420
um

1853
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:31,560
conveniently okay

1854
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,540
yeah very quickly I just want to point

1855
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,400
out that in the intro domain case it's

1856
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,960
important to understand an engineer

1857
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,940
domain case for that matter that the

1858
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:41,159
majority of spoofed attack traffic

1859
01:40:41,159 --> 01:40:42,900
whether it's direct path to dance attack

1860
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,639
whether it's a spoofed attack initiation

1861
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,500
traffic that's used to stimulate

1862
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,239
reflection amplification attacks the

1863
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:49,560
majority of this traffic is actually

1864
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,719
generated by server-class machines in

1865
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:54,300
data centers internet data centers idcs

1866
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:56,340
and there's a well-known mechanism it

1867
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:57,420
was actually described in an

1868
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:00,120
informational Roc which I put in the

1869
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,820
chat that's called draft Baker Saba

1870
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:05,219
Cisco IP sourcegard zero zero it's

1871
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:06,780
called IP sourceguard and it's a

1872
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:08,400
mechanism that actually operates at the

1873
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,080
switch level and I'm kind of it's

1874
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,760
surprising that I haven't seen any

1875
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,340
discussion of that uh in in this working

1876
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:16,560
group especially in the intro domain use

1877
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,800
case and then secondly when we come to

1878
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:22,199
Cable types cmts types of access systems

1879
01:41:22,199 --> 01:41:24,120
there's another mechanism called cable

1880
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,820
Source verify which is very similar

1881
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:28,880
there is no draft that actually

1882
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,900
describes us to my knowledge but it's

1883
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:32,880
not patented technology and so I think

1884
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,500
that we need to take a look at this

1885
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:37,199
especially since it's this is a

1886
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:39,239
mechanism that is an intra-domain

1887
01:41:39,239 --> 01:41:41,460
deployed mechanism that can work quite

1888
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:42,719
well I just want to make sure everybody

1889
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:44,340
in the working group was aware of these

1890
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:46,320
two mechanisms that's all I oh and

1891
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,540
finally there's a typo

1892
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:51,780
um the convergence ends with an e and

1893
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:53,760
not with a Y just a minor thing thanks

1894
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,580
very much that's all I had

1895
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:59,480
okay thank you

1896
01:42:04,139 --> 01:42:04,800
um

1897
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,199
future with Technologies

1898
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:10,020
comment as an individual participant

1899
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:12,179
so when I look at this architecture uh

1900
01:42:12,179 --> 01:42:13,739
you know clearly that table that we're

1901
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:15,840
trying to build seems to be the focus of

1902
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,980
the architecture however this document

1903
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:22,739
defines or is based on

1904
01:42:22,739 --> 01:42:25,260
the Assumption of a specific solution

1905
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:26,699
right there are many mentions in the

1906
01:42:26,699 --> 01:42:29,639
presentation around uh you know periodic

1907
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:31,320
updates and even a discussion at the end

1908
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:33,179
around incremental deployment and how do

1909
01:42:33,179 --> 01:42:34,500
we converge faster and things like that

1910
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:38,520
which are related to a solution

1911
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,380
right not related to what the actors

1912
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:43,380
might look like the point here is that

1913
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:44,520
um you know the architecture can still

1914
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:45,659
be met

1915
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,100
with

1916
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,900
different solutions

1917
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:51,420
and what I would like to see is this

1918
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:53,520
document to be a general document

1919
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:57,300
of what we would like to again the high

1920
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:58,920
level architecture to be not the

1921
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,739
solution solution is going to come later

1922
01:43:00,739 --> 01:43:03,000
and it is something that we will need to

1923
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,520
to discuss of course so I think that

1924
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,500
again this document can definitely be

1925
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:12,239
generalized uh without losing the

1926
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:13,020
um

1927
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,820
the advantages they're trying to be to

1928
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:16,139
be presented here

1929
01:43:16,139 --> 01:43:17,760
thanks

1930
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,119
yeah

1931
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:40,560
okay

1932
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,560
foreign

1933
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:50,340
we will share some preliminary ideas

1934
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:54,360
that is to narrow the gaps of existing

1935
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:58,080
inter domain as a way mechanisms uh here

1936
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:03,119
is the three main gaps of they are they

1937
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:04,860
have been described in the problem

1938
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:08,520
statement uh draft first is in power

1939
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,500
permit in part and the second is in

1940
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:13,260
power block and the third one is running

1941
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:16,739
in San Diego next time please

1942
01:44:16,739 --> 01:44:19,800
uh so how to narrow the gaps we think

1943
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:21,360
about

1944
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,920
oh okay

1945
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:27,360
uh so hot narrow the gaps uh we think

1946
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:30,540
about generating accurate as we rules at

1947
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:33,719
all directions of the validation as the

1948
01:44:33,719 --> 01:44:37,320
validation s is a lesson conductor

1949
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:39,840
social class validation there are two

1950
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,199
key points firstly is accurate as well

1951
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,300
rules that means I call The Source

1952
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:47,540
prefix and the accurate

1953
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:50,580
incoming interface and second is all at

1954
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,860
all directions generate that is

1955
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:57,860
generator rules at our interface of a

1956
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:59,659
interface

1957
01:44:59,659 --> 01:45:02,880
there are two expected results if those

1958
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,420
one is if we have accurate more accurate

1959
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:09,480
as well rules we can reduce improper

1960
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:12,540
permit as a provider interface and the

1961
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:16,080
incentive can be improved can also be

1962
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,540
improved a little and the second result

1963
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:21,540
is if how accurate as we rules as a

1964
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,360
customer interface uh where you can

1965
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,100
avoid the improper block and the

1966
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:28,260
improper parameter in some particular

1967
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:32,400
scenarios yes please uh tour trip this

1968
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,380
goal is not easy we need to overcome

1969
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:35,699
some challenges

1970
01:45:35,699 --> 01:45:39,600
for validation as if the validation S12

1971
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,639
generator as we rules for the source

1972
01:45:41,639 --> 01:45:44,940
prefix Source prefixes of orange AIS

1973
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:48,239
there are usually Three Steps step one

1974
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:51,900
is to get the source prefixes of the 100

1975
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:55,679
as Step 2 is to obtain the real incoming

1976
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:57,900
direction of the package coming from the

1977
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:00,900
100 as and the substrate is to generate

1978
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:02,820
as well Rules by bending the source

1979
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:07,080
prefixes to the incoming interface the

1980
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,900
channel one comes from Step One how can

1981
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:12,119
we get the accurate and complete set of

1982
01:46:12,119 --> 01:46:15,540
photos prefixes of uh of the orange as

1983
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:18,480
and the challenge tool is how to get

1984
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,639
accurate and complete incoming

1985
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:22,940
directions of the only AIS

1986
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:25,679
uh by using the local rape information

1987
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:29,360
is not enough so the main idea is to

1988
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:33,119
allow axis to cooperate with each other

1989
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:35,400
they can exchange some extra information

1990
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:39,480
to address challenge one uh we

1991
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,820
we use Source prefix either attachment

1992
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:44,520
process that is Spa process the main

1993
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:48,060
idea is simple uh so orange s can or

1994
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:50,940
knows the heightened prefixes to the

1995
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:55,260
validation as even the prefixes are not

1996
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:58,739
or non-stop by pgp the validation s can

1997
01:46:58,739 --> 01:46:59,900
learn the

1998
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:03,480
prefixes owned by the owner or original

1999
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:06,380
AIS through the spa message

2000
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:09,619
this process can be used in the DSR

2001
01:47:09,619 --> 01:47:13,560
scenario yes please and the second is

2002
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:18,300
SPD process only as can advertise is

2003
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:21,980
preferred as passes to the validation as

2004
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:26,159
soon so as passes connects to the orange

2005
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:28,380
s and the validation as then the

2006
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:30,360
validation s will learn the real

2007
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,760
incoming Direction and any other

2008
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:35,900
directions will be considered as invalid

2009
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:39,600
you and the their relationship

2010
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,400
between the neighbors and the validation

2011
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:45,600
is is set to be if you see our V2 here

2012
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,360
next please

2013
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:50,420
yeah here are some Financial

2014
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:53,219
improvements Improvement we can deal

2015
01:47:53,219 --> 01:47:56,100
with the improper block problems in the

2016
01:47:56,100 --> 01:48:00,000
DSR scenario and second is eliminated in

2017
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,760
proper Block in the no export scenario

2018
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,020
next

2019
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:05,400
uh

2020
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,219
and the improved 3 is about the

2021
01:48:08,219 --> 01:48:12,000
incentive we can have a relatively more

2022
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
strict validation as a provider

2023
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,239
interface and the reflective attacks can

2024
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:22,440
be blocked here so the social prefix can

2025
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:25,980
be protected by the validation s and

2026
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:31,080
finally is no improper parameter in

2027
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:35,040
yeah okay uh

2028
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:39,000
uh of course tour child is go uh by

2029
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,540
using spa and the SPD is not enough uh

2030
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:43,739
if the

2031
01:48:43,739 --> 01:48:46,080
uh as fast in the control player and the

2032
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,980
data plan are not inconsistent the

2033
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:53,040
results may be

2034
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:57,239
not good I mean there may exists in

2035
01:48:57,239 --> 01:49:02,119
proper block problems uh

2036
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:07,260
advertise the redirection as access to

2037
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:10,860
the Andreas so that the validation s or

2038
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:14,219
can also learn the redefraction pass

2039
01:49:14,219 --> 01:49:17,340
from the Orange is yes please

2040
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:21,060
uh here are some considerations uh we

2041
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:23,639
have some analysis in the draft next

2042
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:25,440
please

2043
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:29,040
yeah really a quick presentation because

2044
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:32,040
due to time limitation this architecture

2045
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,800
is protocol independent welcome to Lee

2046
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,500
we are comments or questions in the chat

2047
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:39,780
box and the mailing list we will respond

2048
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:43,820
to term one member thanks

2049
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:53,520
so we will leave no time for discuss and

2050
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:57,080
we'll move to the next protection

2051
01:50:19,639 --> 01:50:21,739
this is

2052
01:50:21,739 --> 01:50:25,199
yeah uh I don't know who do you like to

2053
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:29,280
uh also I think we have one minute to

2054
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:32,699
foreign okay

2055
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:38,040
for the question

2056
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,460
okay

2057
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,239
let's begin on my part please please

2058
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:44,659
proceed

2059
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:48,420
you'll drive the slides

2060
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:49,940
okay thank you

2061
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:54,719
hey everybody I'm Igor last time uh last

2062
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:55,860
ATF

2063
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:57,840
um we talked a little bit about barthev

2064
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,639
our

2065
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:02,460
one of our Solutions this is a work

2066
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:05,280
we're doing with cider apps but it's

2067
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,260
super relevant so we wanted to make sure

2068
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,659
we keep you appraised of what we're

2069
01:51:09,659 --> 01:51:12,860
doing next

2070
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:16,560
thank you so

2071
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,739
um this is just a list of requirements

2072
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:22,980
for Sav as we're looking at them

2073
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:26,159
again we're not doing uh we're not

2074
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:29,400
boiling the ocean we're just protecting

2075
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:32,699
uh a network looking at only the

2076
01:51:32,699 --> 01:51:35,460
customers and uh peers we are not

2077
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:37,679
protecting from traffic from uh coming

2078
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:41,639
from provider just to before but anyway

2079
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:44,400
um the requirements for service seniors

2080
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:47,699
are the most important thing by far is

2081
01:51:47,699 --> 01:51:51,420
improper block uh that's basically if

2082
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:52,980
you have improper blocks that's what

2083
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:56,880
gets you uh not implemented because

2084
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,760
that's that's a network optimized for

2085
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:00,840
the most

2086
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:03,360
um don't break their customers

2087
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:06,300
um and obviously improper permit or

2088
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:09,480
otherwise what's the point so

2089
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:13,139
just can't emphasize it more uh the rate

2090
01:52:13,139 --> 01:52:15,840
of improper block you should really be

2091
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:18,600
competing against loser payoff

2092
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:22,500
um so that's that's the goal and

2093
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:25,199
comes hand in hand a high quality

2094
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:28,199
implementation is required no matter if

2095
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:31,500
your algorithm is vague or too

2096
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,840
complicated uh

2097
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,500
and it's not implemented right like it's

2098
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,600
almost as good as you don't have a good

2099
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:41,400
algorithm

2100
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:46,139
um next is incremental deployability uh

2101
01:52:46,139 --> 01:52:49,440
super important uh business economic

2102
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:52,739
incentives as a key if you are the first

2103
01:52:52,739 --> 01:52:56,340
adapter and you don't get benefits you

2104
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:58,020
don't implement it and therefore we

2105
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:00,060
don't have adoption

2106
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:02,760
um especially there should be benefits

2107
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:05,100
for early adopters

2108
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:06,239
um

2109
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:10,619
so there are some benefits to protecting

2110
01:53:10,619 --> 01:53:12,000
just

2111
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,760
traffic going up from your customers or

2112
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,060
from your peers I mean your reputation

2113
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:21,239
of uis is go is important uh stopping

2114
01:53:21,239 --> 01:53:22,800
your traffic

2115
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:26,040
telling your customers that they have a

2116
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:29,460
problem is it could be useful useful

2117
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:33,540
service and like it was said before if

2118
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:35,760
you're spending a lot of bits a lot of

2119
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,880
capacity and garbage uh well that's your

2120
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,880
network capacity too and depending on

2121
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:45,060
um your cost structure it may be

2122
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:46,920
actually a good idea not to pay for

2123
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:51,119
transit for traffic that's garbage

2124
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:53,900
all right and um

2125
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:56,100
ease of adoption it's usually an

2126
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:58,560
overlooked Factor but it's very

2127
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:02,040
important uh human factors are huge uh

2128
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:03,119
so

2129
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:06,600
um it's very important thing and network

2130
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,460
effects that's kind of later if

2131
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:10,920
everybody is adapting in this have maybe

2132
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:13,260
some government will require it but uh

2133
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:16,100
so anyway next

2134
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:18,440
um

2135
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:20,540
not gonna

2136
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:23,760
the next slide please thank you I'm not

2137
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,619
going to describe it in detail uh

2138
01:54:25,619 --> 01:54:27,840
basically the power save is just taking

2139
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:31,139
BJP data that's usually that other

2140
01:54:31,139 --> 01:54:33,119
algorithms are using and augmenting is

2141
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:36,480
this rpki data for cases where there is

2142
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,400
a symmetric routes and or any other sort

2143
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:42,119
of traffic engineering uh we can get uh

2144
01:54:42,119 --> 01:54:45,300
information about uh prefixes as well as

2145
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:49,619
customer relationships from rpki

2146
01:54:49,619 --> 01:54:51,900
through the detailed presentation so I'm

2147
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:54,000
not going to go into much more detail

2148
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,840
here next

2149
01:54:57,900 --> 01:55:00,420
um again this is a general operation of

2150
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:03,239
it you can read the slides uh basically

2151
01:55:03,239 --> 01:55:05,580
compute the customer code by following

2152
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:09,659
asps relationship in bgp as well as asba

2153
01:55:09,659 --> 01:55:12,119
when available once you have the

2154
01:55:12,119 --> 01:55:14,159
customer code which is set of os numbers

2155
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:17,280
in that your customer for any particular

2156
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,560
interface you can build a separate

2157
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:23,880
interface you look at again DGP uh

2158
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:27,060
matching originating AES and prefix as

2159
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:30,300
well as raw data that's registered and

2160
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:33,239
compute the set of cider blocks and

2161
01:55:33,239 --> 01:55:38,159
that's your as filter for the save next

2162
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:39,980
um and this is basically my last slide

2163
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:42,659
uh how we are measuring against improp

2164
01:55:42,659 --> 01:55:45,659
what we're doing for our requirements uh

2165
01:55:45,659 --> 01:55:48,060
we are trying to reduce person for most

2166
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,280
improper block by discovering more

2167
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:54,360
prefixes and more as numbers uh using

2168
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:57,360
information not available in BJP

2169
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:59,719
um we have in the new draft

2170
01:55:59,719 --> 01:56:03,239
implementation guidelines for trying to

2171
01:56:03,239 --> 01:56:06,540
improve the quality of implementations

2172
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:09,600
it doesn't require signal for from

2173
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:12,420
anybody else so it's Deployable

2174
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,719
um and it doesn't require people to

2175
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:18,600
learn any new technologies Beyond bgp

2176
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:22,199
and rpki so it's like uh

2177
01:56:22,199 --> 01:56:25,139
easier for people to understand

2178
01:56:25,139 --> 01:56:29,239
um right it doesn't require new hardware

2179
01:56:29,239 --> 01:56:31,679
really as long as you have a little bit

2180
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:35,040
of memory uh for the new sub list you

2181
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,860
can use your an existing Hardware you

2182
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:40,020
just need to make sure you can load it

2183
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:43,639
and that's about it

2184
01:56:44,219 --> 01:56:45,900
thank you

2185
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:48,840
so I think this is one kind of a seven

2186
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:52,500
table at one kind of measure that will

2187
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:55,860
form for for my established service

2188
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:58,199
table okay

2189
01:56:58,199 --> 01:57:01,219
thank you

2190
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:06,980
yeah I don't know okay

2191
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,119
to make a journal comment that this

2192
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:11,159
direction seems to be

2193
01:57:11,159 --> 01:57:13,320
um to me to be more in alignment with

2194
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:16,080
the actual statement uh uh in the

2195
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,880
working group Charter about making use

2196
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:20,360
of existing mechanisms and not extending

2197
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:22,320
mechanisms but rather we're actually

2198
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:23,760
looking at potentially weaving them

2199
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,880
together and so of all of the

2200
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,679
um approach potential approaches that

2201
01:57:28,679 --> 01:57:30,480
have been discussed so far this General

2202
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:33,420
approach to me seems to be

2203
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:36,239
um the one that uh at least a vector

2204
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:40,020
that has a higher uh potential degree of

2205
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:43,159
success than some of the others

2206
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:46,920
foreign

2207
01:57:58,739 --> 01:58:00,540
chair can you hear me

2208
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:02,159
yeah okay

2209
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:05,099
okay thank you uh I'll be quick uh hello

2210
01:58:05,099 --> 01:58:08,239
everyone this is mungshao from new h3c

2211
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:11,219
technologies uh this presentation is

2212
01:58:11,219 --> 01:58:14,159
about analysis of some data playing

2213
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:16,260
Performance Based on an implementation

2214
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:20,040
of independent step table

2215
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:22,519
foreign

2216
01:58:24,619 --> 01:58:27,300
we've heard some concerns about the data

2217
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:29,900
play performance since last meeting

2218
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:33,179
whether of the existing said nothing

2219
01:58:33,179 --> 01:58:35,040
wrongs or new ones

2220
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,080
one of the main purposes of this draft

2221
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:40,820
is to address those concerns

2222
01:58:42,599 --> 01:58:45,360
I think now has already given a good

2223
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,699
presentation about the basic idea of set

2224
01:58:47,699 --> 01:58:53,598
table so let me just skip this slide

2225
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:57,900
uh in order to improve the accuracy in

2226
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:00,840
new format mechanisms are expected to

2227
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:03,780
generate step rules based on the real

2228
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:07,380
forwarding path so independent self

2229
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:10,020
table may be required actually the

2230
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:13,440
existing efp uipf already requires

2231
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:16,199
independent self table or referred to as

2232
01:59:16,199 --> 01:59:20,340
the RPF list but efp record has never

2233
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:23,940
been coded in the draft we describe a

2234
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:26,760
possible method to realize independent

2235
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:29,400
cell table on data plane as shown in the

2236
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:31,380
figures each line count has a local

2237
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:33,960
table which stores part of same rules

2238
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:36,480
that are related with its own interfaces

2239
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:39,599
the keys of local table are Source

2240
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:42,719
prefix and valid incoming interface and

2241
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:45,900
no result zone is required a global

2242
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:48,179
table is also used to store all the

2243
01:59:48,179 --> 01:59:51,840
known source prefixes which is a union

2244
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,739
of source prefixes in all local tables

2245
01:59:55,739 --> 01:59:57,360
uh

2246
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,020
and the figure shows the

2247
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:02,580
packet processing procedure

2248
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:04,280
[Music]

2249
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:09,300
and a you you can read the draft for

2250
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:14,360
more details or just a scoop here

2251
02:00:17,159 --> 02:00:19,320
yeah this slide shows the performance

2252
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:22,080
testing including some existing

2253
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:25,699
mechanisms and the independent subtable

2254
02:00:25,699 --> 02:00:28,679
the tested equipment is an interesting

2255
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:32,159
CCR device the test of Graphics are IPv6

2256
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:35,099
small package Flows at line rate

2257
02:00:35,099 --> 02:00:39,440
my performance is evaluated by PPS

2258
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:43,320
compared with playing forwarding the

2259
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:45,840
performance loss of different theft

2260
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,099
mechanisms are all around five percent

2261
02:00:49,099 --> 02:00:53,219
the performance of independent self

2262
02:00:53,219 --> 02:00:57,360
table is roughly equivalent to uipf we

2263
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,300
also tested the

2264
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:02,580
independent self table mechanism under

2265
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:06,420
different scales of source prefixes and

2266
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:08,580
the performance has no substantial

2267
02:01:08,580 --> 02:01:11,059
changes

2268
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:15,540
uh yeah and uh the next step is to

2269
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:17,340
revise the draft according to feedbacks

2270
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:19,380
and any questions or comments are

2271
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:22,280
welcome thank you

2272
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:27,739
yeah that's all thank you

2273
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:37,800
yeah I was I was curious

2274
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,480
um based on the requirements there is

2275
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:40,920
there's only a few requirements that I

2276
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:42,239
saw in the

2277
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:45,300
um analysis drafts

2278
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:45,960
um

2279
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:49,440
and I was wondering how like we've seen

2280
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:52,020
this SPD table stuff and I'm just new to

2281
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:55,139
this so excuse my unfamiliarity with it

2282
02:01:55,139 --> 02:01:58,679
but um I've seen the SPD table stuff as

2283
02:01:58,679 --> 02:02:01,080
kind of one solution maybe not an

2284
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,460
architecture but it looks like a

2285
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:05,280
specific solution and then the the bars

2286
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:07,980
have stuff is has the is there any

2287
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:10,980
analysis that the group has done on you

2288
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:12,659
know comparing these two things like

2289
02:02:12,659 --> 02:02:14,400
existing

2290
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:18,420
technology solution versus the SPD table

2291
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:19,920
this isn't specifically for this

2292
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:21,659
presenter but if you know something that

2293
02:02:21,659 --> 02:02:24,060
would be great thanks

2294
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:29,340
uh I think uh this uh this data plane

2295
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:33,300
subtable uh can be used by different uh

2296
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:36,719
control uh uh control plane mechanisms

2297
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:41,219
and uh is not limited to a specific

2298
02:02:41,219 --> 02:02:44,219
solution

2299
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,179
all right thanks

2300
02:02:48,179 --> 02:02:50,219
thank you

2301
02:02:50,219 --> 02:02:52,699
okay

2302
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,699
um very quick question is the source

2303
02:02:56,699 --> 02:02:58,500
code and the implementation details for

2304
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:00,960
the South mechanisms that were listed in

2305
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:02,159
the performance table is that

2306
02:03:02,159 --> 02:03:05,360
information publicly available

2307
02:03:06,599 --> 02:03:11,219
uh sorry uh uh uh the source code is

2308
02:03:11,219 --> 02:03:14,639
currently not available and uh we we

2309
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:19,639
just implemented an early prototype

2310
02:03:19,739 --> 02:03:22,199
I'm sorry uh very helpful if those could

2311
02:03:22,199 --> 02:03:23,820
be allowed to examine the source code

2312
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:26,239
thank you

2313
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:31,739
okay thank you for overcoming so uh we

2314
02:03:31,739 --> 02:03:34,080
must close the media and for the foreign

2315
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:37,080
okay

2316
02:04:11,219 --> 02:04:14,219
foreign

2317
02:04:41,219 --> 02:04:44,000
foreign

2318
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:21,679
foreign
