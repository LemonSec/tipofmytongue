1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,219
I think

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,980
on the right

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,980
okay

4
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,020
what you said

5
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,679
I'm gonna try

6
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,200
again

7
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,340
we have two microphones for some reason

8
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,760
so

9
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,900
yeah issues

10
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,220
sound check right

11
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,939
oh

12
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,340
I don't know if that works all right but

13
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,720
you're gonna drive the slides or you've

14
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,820
got the slides I've got the slides

15
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,779
right yes

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,299
maybe I need a football game and is

17
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,720
there a

18
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,380
oh

19
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,420
is that your computer do you want to do

20
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,899
it on this one

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,299
okay

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,780
uh bootstraps

23
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,020
yeah so we'll just ask people to do

24
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,080
things slide yeah

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,280
anyway we can get started whenever

26
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,080
all right I think we're ready to get

27
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,440
started

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,800
do you not hear me

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,340
I can ask

30
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,900
all right

31
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,860
Mike for breakfast

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,560
um all right so if we can get started

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,900
um we are your chairs I'm Leslie he's

34
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,360
Kyle for the media operations working

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,920
group

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,700
um

37
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,500
and as noted on the slide this session

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,000
is being recorded next slide

39
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,980
um I hope you have all noted well this

40
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,200

um so just let me know when you want me

106
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,979
to Advance the next Slide the clicker is

107
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,159
not working

108
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,500
okay hi everyone my name is uh rainan

109
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,440
Krishna and I'll be presenting an update

110
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,759
to our draft uh this is Joint work with

111
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,500
this is Joint work with uh

112
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,740
do you want to check yeah

113
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,360
but stay on the painting so that you

114
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,699
stay in videos

115
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,240
yeah

116
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,539
so uh for this particular update we have

117
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,020
uh changed sections or updated sections

118
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,100
3.1 and 5.1 and we'll uh describe what

119
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,720
we have done in those sections in the

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,460
next few slides next slide please

121
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,819
so uh thanks to Colin Jennings we have

122
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,919
uh elaborated the techniques to acquire

123
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,460
a model of the real world and this is in

124
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,880
section 3.1 so we already had an

125
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,919
annotated Point cloud based model

126
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,740
description uh we have added a couple of

127
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,900
lines for polygon mesh and texture

128
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,000
mapping techniques

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,120
and we have added a model based on light

130
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,300
field which is uh in data structure

131
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,940
terms a table called uh environment map

132
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,759
that describes the intensity or color of

133
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,800
the light rays arriving at a single

134
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,380
point from arbitrary Direction so a

135
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,780
couple of lines each for uh all of those

136
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,259
three models looks like this

137
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:42,120
uh in section 5.1 we have elaborated the

138
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,599
AR traffic workload characteristics uh

139
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,340
that the operators will have to support

140
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,639
in use cases such as us so uh in

141
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
particular uh if we imagine multiple AR

142
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,780
devices connecting to uh Edge server uh

143
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,000
each of the traffic being generated by

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,300
each of the AR device is actually uh

145
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,120
heavy tail and um

146
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,400
if you aggregate heavy-tailed uh traffic

147
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,940
what you'll find is what is known as a

148
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,979
long-range dependent traffic with two

149
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,560
particular uh characteristics the first

150
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,800
is the parameters of the traffic such as

151
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,699
uh volume of XR data uh burst time uh

152
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,840
idle time uh they are uh they could be

153
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
widely separated in time but show

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,120
correlation and also you'd find a long

155
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,500
bursts of uh traffic so the operators

156
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,140
should be able to provision net server

157
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,779
so that they can manage the long bursts

158
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,560
and traffic uh next slide please

159
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,779
so really this slide should have been

160
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,779
titled uh next steps so in the previous

161
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,399
ITF we uh were uh the working groupers

162
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,459
had suggested us to uh present some

163
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,820
numbers so we have uh dug into some of

164
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
the publicly available data and uh so

165
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,060
here is a list of uh throughputs uh for

166
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,700
certain types of applications

167
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,700
so for example for image and workflow

168
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,880
downloading uh you'd have one Mbps and

169
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,160
we've given the reference there for

170
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,740
video conferencing we'd need a capacity

171
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,760
of two Mbps

172
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,000
for 3D model and data visualization uh

173
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,240
we'll need 2 to 20 Mbps

174
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,519
uh for two-way telepresence we'd need

175
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,779
five to uh 25 Mbps for uh current

176
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,560
generation 360 video typically 4K you'd

177
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,620
need 10 to 50 Mbps

178
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,120
um for Next Generation 360 degree video

179
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,920
and that should read 8K not BK sorry

180
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,000
about that and 90 plus frames per second

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,459
HDR and stereoscopic

182
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,200
stereoscopic coming for for uh for both

183
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,980
eyes you'd need typically 50 to 200 Mbps

184
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,160
uh per second

185
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,920
and finally for six degree of Freedom

186
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,500
video or Point Cloud you'd need 200 to

187
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,899
1000 Mbps

188
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,420
um uh so so these are the some of the

189
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,279
throughput numbers that we have found in

190
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,000
reference one next slide please

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,240
and here is another set of numbers here

192
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,180
we have included the expected end-to-end

193
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,540
latency values as well uh and we have a

194
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,760
a set of applications arranged in uh

195
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,440
taxonomy

196
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,580
so the first one is ar-based remote

197
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,079
surgery with uncompressed 4K 120 frames

198
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,019
per second HDR 10 bit real-time video

199
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,880
stream

200
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,980
so for this the expected end-to-end

201
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,640
latency is around 750

202
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,500
microseconds uh the expected data

203
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,100
capacity is 30 gbps and uh possible

204
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,980
implementation examples are this is

205
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,839
basically a newspaper article which

206
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,940
claims to be the world's first remote

207
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,060
surgery over 5G

208
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,339
then the second application is mobile

209
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,040
ar-based remote assistance with

210
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,180
uncompressed 4K 120 FPS HDR 10-bit

211
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,000
real-time video stream uh the expected

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,560
end-to-end latency is less than 10

213
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,440
milliseconds the expected data capacity

214
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,940
is 7.5 gbps and a possible

215
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,380
implementations or examples are

216
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,620
assisting maintenance technicians

217
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,019
so these are essentially uh helping in

218
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,779
the workflow then industry four point or

219
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,540
remote maintenance remote assistance in

220
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,660
robotics industry with those references

221
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,000
then the third application is indoor and

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,120
localized outdoor navigation and in this

223
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,260
taxonomy from reference to uh our

224
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,899
particular AR use case fits in that

225
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:01,860
category

226
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,560
so the expected end-to-end latency is

227
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,260
less than 20 milliseconds the expected

228
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,940
data capacity is 50 to 200 Milli Mbps

229
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,519
and a possible implementation examples

230
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,600
are theme parks shopping malls

231
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,779
archaeological sites and Museum guidance

232
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,540
and finally for cloud-based mobile AR

233
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,940
applications the expected end-to-end

234
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,579
latency is less than 50 milliseconds uh

235
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,740
the expected data capacity is 50 to 100

236
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,260
megabits per second and you have a

237
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,760
couple of possible implementation

238
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,980
examples there

239
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,640
um

240
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,100
so one thing we wanted to point out for

241
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,060
our use case is that our use case is

242
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,660
obviously for a mobile AR scenario and

243
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,620
that it uh specifically deals with a

244
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,440
scenario where you have uh tourists

245
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,660
moving in an outdoor location

246
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,180
and outdoor locations are typically very

247
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,680
challenging for most of the techniques

248
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,339
because the uh the uh light conditions

249
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,800
change continuously the angle at which

250
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,740
the uh tourists is looking at the scene

251
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,839
changes continuously

252
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,000
and there might be people uh moving in

253
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,380
and out of the uh AR Field view so so

254
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,399
our particular uh use case uh tries to

255
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,180
uh showcase the problems inherent in an

256
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,940
outdoor mobile AR system

257
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,399
so with JS permission now I'd like to

258
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,760
invite uh comments and discussion uh

259
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,139
does the working group like these

260
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,459
numbers uh do we uh is it okay to for us

261
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,320
to write up these numbers in the actual

262
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,300
draft because this slide in the previous

263
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,579
Slide the numbers shown there have not

264
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,320
yet been included in the internet draft

265
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,240
because we wanted to have a discussion

266
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,779
at this ITF so uh comments suggestions

267
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,940
are welcome and please please use the

268
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,200
mediacal queue

269
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,480
so

270
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,339
or the round trip time

271
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,500
yes

272
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,100
um

273
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,700
but

274
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,519
hmm

275
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,100
so yes this is round trip time yes

276
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,200
so you are assuming the application is

277
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,940
interactive right

278
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,100
say it again you you are assuming the

279
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,079
application is Interactive

280
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:49,019
yes okay and uh this 30 gigabits per

281
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,540
second the number is seems too huge

282
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,300
right uh absolutely uh I think one of

283
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,279
the questions which I had after seeing

284
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,279
this reference was uh is is it common

285
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,820
practice so send uncompressed 4K videos

286
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,620
um

287
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,480
or or do we need to send the compressed

288
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,399
4K video because if you send

289
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,360
uncompressed 4K you would get uh a high

290
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,579
data capacity requirement

291
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,820
yeah I think the problem is your entire

292
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,920
latency is too tight maybe for the

293
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,100
compression the conversion com Computing

294
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,880
time is only bigger than okay this one

295
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,220
and I know that there are more people in

296
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,779
the mic line than there are in the

297
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,820
online line so if you could use your

298
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,320
phones while you're in the mic line to

299
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,959
actually get in queue uh next thing here

300
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,979
is Sam Hurst

301
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,779
other Sam has BBC already uh just a uh

302
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,760
on the uncompressed have you considered

303
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,279
maybe doing something like an iframe

304
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,440
only very low latency and code that's

305
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
going to have much higher quality and

306
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,459
we'll be

307
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,560
realistically as close as uncompressed

308
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,000
could possibly be to the human

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,519
perception

310
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,959
sorry could you repeat that I couldn't

311
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,660
hear that yeah um

312
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,279
we're gonna we're gonna raise the mic

313
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,180
just give it aside

314
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,959
um yeah it's just uh instead of using uh

315
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,579
completely uncompressed to be considered

316
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,040
a really low latency iframe only in

317
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,959
Crash uh compression which is to the

318
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,699
human visual system will be as close as

319
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,500
uncompressed and would probably save you

320
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,899
quite a lot of that data capacity

321
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,000
uh yeah absolutely and I think so so

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,920
this is this is from someone else's

323
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,899
world this is not our work

324
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,720
um and what we really want to do is to

325
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,420
capture the current industry practice uh

326
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,579
in this document

327
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:44,220
um and the goal really is to have uh

328
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,980
some operator going out and deploying uh

329
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,000
in the field something like our use case

330
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,519
and uh and definitely I'd welcome uh

331
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,339
your comments on the draft at GitHub if

332
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,680
uh if you feel that that's an important

333
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,480
thing that needs to be mentioned in the

334
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,000
graph okay thanks very much thanks

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,040
all right and the chair recognizes

336
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,140
himself

337
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,859
um

338
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,839
it's it seems to me like if you're going

339
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,900
to put numbers in at all they're kind of

340
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,599
a a moment in time and they need to be

341
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,579
from the same moment in time right I

342
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,679
mean uncompressed video right obviously

343
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,900
is not going to change bitrate ever for

344
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,520
the same resolution but compression

345
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,859
compressed video will over time so are

346
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,559
these numbers all from kind of a similar

347
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,540
generation of technology for video

348
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,400
compression that would be the important

349
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,900
part and to make it clear in the draft I

350
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,240
I note I note that I I haven't read it

351
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,580
since you've made the changes

352
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,620
um uh

353
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,480
it does the draft make it clear that

354
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,820
that this is from a moment in time and

355
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,280
you know put it in that context

356
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,860
absolutely so so this is uh this is from

357
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,840
uh reference to so uh see so all the

358
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,380
references from there are uh roughly in

359
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,660
the

360
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,640
2017-2018-2020 time frame

361
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,580
um and I agree that we should specify

362
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,059
the time frame for for the numbers there

363
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,799
uh because they will of course keep

364
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,100
changing

365
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,880
Spencer

366
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,520
uh Spencer Dawkins and

367
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,600
um I congratulate you for uh having

368
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,799
numbers and uh my suggestion I think for

369
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,140
the working group is for us to think in

370
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,580
terms of

371
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,439
rough uh

372
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,240
orders of magnitude you know clumps

373
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,100
rather than you know talk about whether

374
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,039
something is less than 20 milliseconds

375
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,160
or less than 30 milliseconds uh we we

376
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,559
spent an awful lot of time having

377
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,280
similar conversations on streaming media

378
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,200
and uh draft that was just published as

379
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,100
an RFC and uh if I if I had one thing to

380
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,460
do over again I think that would be

381
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,440
like I said moving to moving towards

382
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,160
ranges

383
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,400
and kind of having that that Focus

384
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,539
um

385
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,280
this

386
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,679
this gives us something to shoot at

387
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,720
you know and if somebody accidentally

388
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,780
comes up with a way to uh compress light

389
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,260
Ray uh that'll be awesome

390
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,660
um and uh

391
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,820
kind of not be surprised if we don't

392
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,400
find things to do with the bandwidth

393
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,120
you're just like well if it's not

394
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,840
about 7. you know 45 gigabits

395
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,160
um

396
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,559
you know it will be you know it will be

397
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,539
something but you know something very

398
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,460
large so

399
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,900
um

400
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,539
taking taking what Kyle said about you

401
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:49,919
know going with the show you know one

402
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,360
generation of numbers

403
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,020
uh yeah you know and uh then thinking in

404
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,700
terms of branches I think that's the

405
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,799
best advice I could give to the working

406
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,919
group about about this draft thank you

407
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,400
thanks

408
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,980
uh a couple of other uh issues uh so

409
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,600
yeah but there are there are sorry there

410
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,860
are actually still a couple people in

411
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,500
queue do you wanna do you wanna still

412
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,320
yeah yeah okay all right uh Giles next

413
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,559
foreign

414
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,059
thanks hopefully I'm I'm on audio now

415
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,400
yeah I think for the first number

416
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,780
um I guess I would say I get to my

417
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,960
nervous whenever I see numbers below one

418
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,160
millisecond

419
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,380
um where humans are involved

420
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,179
um absolutely given our perception and

421
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:37,679
particularly if you look at that being

422
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,780
120 frames per second for the first

423
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,799
example

424
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,880
you're never going to get the video

425
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,860
latency down below eight milliseconds on

426
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,880
that basis

427
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,860
so you know really those kind of events

428
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,720
about latency figures are pointless at

429
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,679
that at that stage

430
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,299
foreign

431
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,160
follow-up or you just want to take that

432
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,120
on board

433
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,919
say that again any follow-up or do you

434
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,660
just want to leave a comment on so so

435
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,179
the other issue was

436
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,700
um uh so a couple of ideas ago someone

437
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,580
mentioned that besides Edge we we could

438
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,299
look at other architectures uh but we we

439
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,480
have uh argued in the work in the draft

440
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,960
that edge servers are necessary for uh

441
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,559
latency reasons you need to place the

442
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,440
computation close to the user so one

443
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,280
question I had was are there other

444
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,059
architectures which do not use that

445
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,658
paradigm

446
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,320
other architectures in particular for

447
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,419
for AR for offloading they are

448
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:55,020
computation uh

449
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,080
anyone

450
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,980
anyone

451
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,039
doesn't look like anyone has some any

452
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,659
concrete follow-up I think you might

453
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,220
want to put a comment in the document to

454
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,900
that effect because see if readers of

455
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,340
subsequent versions

456
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,539
have thoughts yeah uh the other issue

457
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,179
was that we envisaged this uh running

458
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,260
over some form of wireless link

459
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,100
uh possibly 5G but Wi-Fi as well

460
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,919
um and we'd like the input from the

461
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,659
working group of what kind of issues

462
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:37,520
might arise uh between various kinds of

463
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,020
Technologies or is that not an issue at

464
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,139
all

465
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,280
oops

466
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,120
not a very working working group this

467
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,239
morning

468
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,340
so I think that these are all important

469
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,140
questions and sort of one of it maybe we

470
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,700
can slide into the where from here part

471
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,059
of of the discussion around the document

472
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,700
um I think that the there's sort of

473
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,559
three things on my mind one I think that

474
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,760
those are all important questions

475
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,380
particularly since people have brought

476
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,000
them up in previous meetings it's like

477
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
can we get closure on whether or not

478
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,299
there are things to follow up here and

479
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,520
if not drop them if yes have concrete

480
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,380
suggestions

481
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,080
um and then there's the question of I

482
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
mean it seems like it's worth it's

483
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,620
important to include some level of

484
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,780
numbers because it's valuable to have

485
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,640
the concreteness

486
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,440
um but I mean following on Spencer's

487
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,299
suggestions and and other sort of

488
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,760
follow-ups it's probably more important

489
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,020
to you know

490
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,559
have a sense of scale of where this fits

491
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,780
with regards to current technology so

492
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,760
keep it current as Kyle said not just in

493
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,960
terms of

494
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,419
all of these numbers from the scene time

495
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,760
period but also compared to what we are

496
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,980
you know what is realistic to deliver or

497
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,900
what what are where are the challenges

498
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,260
in in sort of contemporaneous times

499
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,720
and then the final question is well and

500
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,340
what else

501
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,039
you know is it is it just

502
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,320
it sounds to me the like the the current

503
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,299
action items on this document are the

504
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,940
numbers as just discussed you see do a

505
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,580
last a last you know set of questions to

506
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,659
the working group to see if there's

507
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,820
follow-up on the open questions

508
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,179
and you know if not what else are we

509
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:22,799
done question mark

510
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,299
do you have any thoughts on what else

511
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,520
there will be so so even for numbers for

512
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,280
example we'd love to hear from people uh

513
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,559
if they have numbers with regards to

514
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,020
traffic characteristics

515
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,720
um because uh for from what we have seen

516
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,940
so far to the best of our knowledge that

517
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,940
kind of work has still not been done

518
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,620
um so it would be great to hear from

519
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,080
people if they have some numbers to do

520
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,900
with traffic characteristics

521
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,760
um to make things more concrete really

522
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,380
okay and then there's the question of

523
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,059
how do we best follow this up because

524
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:58,740
I'm getting the sense that remembering

525
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,880
what the questions were at the last

526
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,080
meeting and bringing them to the next

527
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,240
meeting is not is not for provoking

528
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,460
answers

529
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,140
um so I think maybe what we can do is

530
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,120
sort of pull all these questions out and

531
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,860
put them to the mailing list you know

532
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,140
immediately following this meeting and

533
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,240
and try to chase them up

534
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,039
um because I think I'm getting the sense

535
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,020
that we're you know

536
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,179
we may be last calling this document by

537
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:22,860
next meeting

538
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,600
um at least for working group last call

539
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,659
and and we should use that as a Target

540
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,279
yep

541
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,299
any other thoughts from people on that

542
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,980
have I scared everybody out of the mic

543
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,580
queue sorry

544
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,820
okay

545
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,559
thank you very much thank you very much

546
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,120

548
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,140
foreign

549
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,100
you're gonna run the slides yes yes

550
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,740
hi there I'm glendine from Comcast NBC

551
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,600
Universal and today I'm going to give an

552
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,220
update um one of the things when we

553
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,500
created mops a couple years ago was to

554
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,240
try to connect you know

555
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,580
the professional media industry

556
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,520
streamers with work on the ITF and vice

557
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,720
versa so one of the things we've been

558
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,159
doing uh ongoing is at svta means we

559
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,299
give an update on what's going on with

560
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,659
the ITF and at mops meetings we give an

561
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,299
update on what's going on to svta as a

562
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,880
wave connect industry with the media Ops

563
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,320
working group so here's the update for

564
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,440
iitf115 next slide please

565
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,940
so the first thing I'd like to announce

566
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,799
is that SVA

567
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,820
has changed its name to the svta has a t

568
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,100
now because T's are cooler than not

569
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,440
having a t in your name

570
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,760
um but new name same Mission uh we have

571
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,679
a t and we got a new logo that also has

572
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,480
a t in it so it's even cooler than the

573
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,940
old logo uh and we have a new domain

574
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,200
name which is actually much easier to

575
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,400
hike the old one with streaming video

576
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,000
technology Alliance or Siri Siri anyways

577
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,520
that one has just svta much shorter

578
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,760
easier to type and life is better

579
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,520
next slide please

580
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,500
and for those who haven't heard these

581
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,980
updates in the past svta is a Industry

582
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,760
Group

583
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,440
sorry

584
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,080
oh svk is the industry group that is

585
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,940
focused on the following topics it's

586
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,559
really around streaming but it's around

587
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,340
covering you know immersive video uh QE

588
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,740
edge storage players on playback live

589
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,320
streaming metadata open cache networking

590
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,760
and Transport Group I actually share

591
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,799
over there and privacy and protection so

592
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,580
it takes stuff from the ITF and other

593
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,559
groups and it actually is professional

594
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,179
media people doing this for living

595
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,400
delivering this environment and putting

596
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,679
this stuff to work and so that's why we

597
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,120
have this connection point because this

598
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,980
is what's using output for us here at

599
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,360
the ITF

600
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,299
and then feeding back insights next

601
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,159
slide please

602
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,140
and as an example of the stuff that is

603
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,000
actively being used Within These groups

604
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,500
uh one of the things we're doing over

605
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,240
the svta is we're cataloging going

606
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,779
through and identifying key Technologies

607
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,720
from groups like The ITF and we plan on

608
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,779
submitting a draft into mops cataloging

609
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,760
what professional groups are using in

610
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,380
terms of ITF Technologies what really

611
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,760
key ones because obviously use a lot of

612
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,159
things right at the very bottom DNS DNS

613
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,679
is used by everything obviously but

614
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,539
clearly you know we have ingest stuff

615
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:51,419
going on we have webrtc big thing in in

616
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,419
this world Asia lost huge

617
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,159
um and all the caching work in fact the

618
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,620
cdni caching being done here at the ITF

619
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,720
is built upon it like I have a few

620
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,279
slides about that but it's built upon

621
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,559
over at the svta into a thing called

622
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,380
open caching which is then being used in

623
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,659
production in environments for in the

624
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,039
real world so it's a great connection

625
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,440
point next slide please oh but I see I

626
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,480
had a typo there I should have RC 9000

627
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,419
for quick not 900 I will fix that

628
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,860
um this this horrible picture and but

629
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,179
it's a great picture at the same time

630
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,220
and if you go to that link you can

631
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,620
actually see the the full picture in all

632
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,380
its Glory what this does is this is a

633
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,820
mapping of

634
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,740
where open caching from svta makes

635
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,779
interconnections with cdni from the ITF

636
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,940
and builds it actually into a production

637
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,159
environment so you can sort of see where

638
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,440
the two pieces All Connect together and

639
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
it makes it all very relevant for for us

640
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,559
here at the ITF and what we're working

641
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,700
on

642
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,200
and that is a horrible picture I

643
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,419
admitted uh I'm gonna try to get them to

644
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:58,679
make a better picture for the next time

645
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,179
we do this so we can sort of illustrate

646
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:02,039
it and you can actually read it so my

647
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,360
apologies

648
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,880
next slide please

649
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,940
uh we have updated the open cache

650
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,039
configuration interface specification

651
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,980
again this builds upon cdni uh there's

652
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,840
version 1.1 just got released over at

653
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,840
the SBA svta sorry I'm still stuck

654
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,640
without that T I need to learn to stick

655
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,820
that t in always but this covers you

656
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,380
know the interfaces for controlling

657
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,899
these environments uh that are deploying

658
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:30,840
uh cdni built upon the open cache

659
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,000
framework from the svta

660
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,720
next slide please

661
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,120
uh RFC 9000. so there's a PLC going on

662
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,179
over at the svta which is attempting to

663
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,039
take quick because for a lot of

664
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,200
streamers quick everybody knows next new

665
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,880
thing really cool technology

666
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,120
production environments very hesitant at

667
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,620
times to pick up brand new technology

668
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,399
and deploy it at scale this is scary and

669
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,960
when we talk to the people who are doing

670
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,220
these things we said well what's your

671
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,500
key problem when they identified well I

672
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,000
know I want to play with it I know I

673
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,039
want to test it but I don't necessarily

674
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,720
know how to do that there's too many

675
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,120
options when I say give me a you know a

676
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,919
quick server there's a lot of quick

677
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,899
server implementations out there how do

678
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,220
I test that I don't know I've got a lot

679
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,659
of guys that are experts you have

680
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:21,899
expertise in TCP delivery a quick

681
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,460
delivery not so much what do we what do

682
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,260
I even have to ask the questions of so

683
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,980
what we've taken on is doing a PLC but

684
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,500
it's sort of a meta PLC in addition to

685
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,720
ultimately measuring you know quick

686
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,140
delivery versus HTTP 2 delivery we're

687
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,299
also documenting how do you build that

688
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,820
test environment so that people who want

689
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,620
to play with a quick technology for

690
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,559
streaming delivery have a framework that

691
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,179
they can take and then they in their own

692
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,520
environments can build it test it and

693
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,399
run it and this involves things like

694
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,500
metrics uh you know how do you hook into

695
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,140
players on on this on the player side

696
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,760
and collect data for them how do you

697
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,620
monitor on the network and how do you

698
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,940
ask the questions and what questions

699
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,860
should you even be asking when you want

700
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,020
to evaluate and understand quick better

701
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,980
next slide please

702
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,480
and in fact one of the exercises we're

703
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,580
doing isn't at the very end of that PLC

704
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,500
to produce a final report with a lot of

705
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,659
glossy slides what we're doing is along

706
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,760
the way we are documenting the thought

707
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,159
process that's going into the quick PLC

708
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,659
so one of these we've already produced

709
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,279
we've produced a tech brief that talks

710
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,539
about quick overall to the streaming

711
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:31,100
environment next slide please

712
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,140
slide I think it was like and we also

713
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,200
have produced a document which talks

714
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
about the testing environment and the

715
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,559
criteria and how we're going to go about

716
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,299
doing it documents the lab environments

717
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,279
we have a phase one lab environment a

718
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,159
phase two lab environment and it talks

719
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:51,299
about the sdhd 4K VR content and the

720
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:53,460
various suggestion control algorithms

721
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,140
we're going to play with as part of the

722
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,299
test framework and so this idea here is

723
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,039
that you can not just see the results of

724
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,720
the test but even before we run the

725
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,539
tests you can weigh in on what tests are

726
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,760
going down and why and why would you

727
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,799
even do that particular test and ask the

728
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:08,940
question are there tests that we're

729
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,440
missing that are relevant to the

730
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,000
professional media environment

731
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,620
and that's available at the link down

732
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,519
below

733
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,419
next slide please

734
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,980
uh so there's a few of us actually the

735
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,980
participants here in the svta but uh so

736
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,679
Sanji over here is uh one of the chairs

737
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,360
over there and there's the email address

738
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,559
if you want to find out more information

739
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,559
I'll point out Ali as well a chair over

740
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,960
at a working group on players and I

741
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,940
chair that we can Transport Group uh so

742
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,500
if you're interested in any of the work

743
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,320
we're doing uh if you've got comments uh

744
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,059
again we release it publicly so you can

745
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:42,960
go take a look you don't have to be a

746
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,539
member to read it uh have a look come

747
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,279
find one of us or drop us email and ask

748
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,919
us questions we're happy to answer them

749
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,539
and with that I'll take any questions

750
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:55,220
that people have at the mic line

751
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,299
and again I'll encourage people to use

752
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:01,200
the media Co Mike line uh one thing that

753
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,820
I'd like to sort of reiterate while

754
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,380
waiting to see if there are questions or

755
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,880
thoughts is

756
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,380
one of the reasons why we're

757
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,659
particularly Keen to have these ongoing

758
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,000
updates from the svta is the fact that

759
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,119
that's the the alliance of Industry

760
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,159
players who are deploying this stuff and

761
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,179
using it at scale so I mean I think it's

762
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,300
it's valuable to see what kinds of

763
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,020
um experiences and ex and expertise

764
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,300
um is available there and not just sort

765
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,060
of the not just

766
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,879
this is not academic deployments of of

767
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,859
Technologies but rather real real world

768
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,320
deployments at scale so opportunities to

769
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,239
ask questions and see what's going on in

770
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,940
terms of uh the use of our Technologies

771
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,119
in that context and and we've also uh

772
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,739
you know the Outreach between the two

773
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,239
groups has resulted in a whole pile of

774
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,760
people that are svta people who didn't

775
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,219
previously come to ITF meetings they're

776
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,020
now coming to ITF meetings and engaged

777
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,280
in the working groups here which is

778
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,080
really awesome that's something I've

779
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,520
championed for a long time to get more

780
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,619
media people into the room here and

781
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,119
we're getting them and I'm really happy

782
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,599
success is always good

783
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,880
yep go ahead

784
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,240
Sam has BBC r d uh just to clarify when

785
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,280
you say over quick do you mean stuff

786
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,040
over HTTP 3 or more broadly everything

787
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,099
over quick no it's already gdp3 the

788
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:24,660
framework yeah it's it's we're not

789
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,400
trying to get into the weeds yet whether

790
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,619
it's really just using it as a as a as a

791
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,720
transport pipe okay right thanks very

792
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,640
much but maybe down the road we'll play

793
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,140
with you know we'll get in and play with

794
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,420
some really cool stuff but baby steps

795
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,520
yeah yeah there's the mock working group

796
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,020
as well which might be of interest there

797
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,300
uh I can't remember exactly which day

798
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,280
that meeting's on

799
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,079
okay if there's no other questions I'll

800
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,599
give up the mic great thank you very

801
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,020
much Glenn

802
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,680
all right

803
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,800
so next we have Luis Contreras

804
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,900
talking about yes thank you

805
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,920
hello everybody so I I will present now

806
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,320
uh follow-up of the one project that we

807
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,020
have in in telefonica the idea is to

808
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,599
deploy Alto for integrating for exposing

809
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,880
the network topology that could be

810
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,460
consumed by the telephonica CDN so this

811
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,339
is an update from uh last IDF so next

812
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:34,020
please

813
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,720
so the the rationale for the work as a

814
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,240
reminder well the idea is to optimize

815
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,099
the delivery of the traffic right so

816
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,099
nowadays the the CDN in telefonica is

817
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:46,380
consuming the topology but is a loaded

818
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,800
uploaded manually so this is apart from

819
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,780
being prone to errors and so the point

820
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,160
is that they are working with a

821
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,900
semi-static view of the topology even

822
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,940
though the topologies have load loaded

823
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,520
time to time there is some in between

824
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,560
the gaps let's say we of this uploaded

825
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,200
upload and there are changes in the

826
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,359
topology and these changes are missed as

827
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,700
are lost so the idea is to have an

828
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,740
automated way of populating the topology

829
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,380
in such a way that telephotical CDN

830
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,000
could have a timely view of the topology

831
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,220
in in every moment right so taking the

832
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,980
best decisions not only thinking on on

833
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,500
the capabilities of the cache node but

834
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,180
also on the transport circumstances

835
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,640
transport situation so this project was

836
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,220
presented in in last idea so I recommend

837
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:33,000
the the progress on that so next please

838
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,940
yeah also as a reminder we are playing

839
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,380
essentially with two concepts the

840
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,480
network map and the cost map and the

841
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,300
network map essentially we identify we

842
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,820
associate in different pids the prefixes

843
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,960
or of the let's say the endpoints of of

844
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,740
um

845
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,900
of the map in this case the endpoints

846
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,400
will be the prefixes for the end users

847
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,260
on one side so the ones that are

848
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,359
requesting the content and another side

849
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,300
the the endpoints will be the cdns the

850
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,640
caches itself so we will have the ideas

851
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,640
to have a number of pids considering all

852
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,700
this kind of endpoints right and then we

853
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,460
will have the the cost map the cosmap

854
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,320
essentially shows the relationship in

855
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,200
terms of some metrics between those pids

856
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,940
in this case the method that we are

857
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,859
using by now is the number of hops the

858
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:21,599
ideas to improve and to enrich all this

859
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,180
metric in the future adding performance

860
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,480
capabilities like latency and and so

861
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,839
so um important to say the the network

862
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,900
map is essentially retrieved through bgp

863
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,540
so the idea is that the alto contains a

864
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,460
bgp speaker the bgp speaker is connected

865
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,380
to Raw reflectors in the network for

866
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,640
collecting this information from the

867
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,040
user so dep session in the in that in

868
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,619
that point and the cost map is retrieved

869
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:50,040
by leveraging on bgpls so bdpls provide

870
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,839
us they build the topology how the

871
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,060
different nodes are interconnected in

872
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,980
the network so having a view of the

873
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,380
number of hops or some other

874
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,560
capabilities that could be exposed by

875
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,578
vdpls next please

876
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,280
so the process follows so far we started

877
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,020
with some

878
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,839
toy environment in the lab then we moved

879
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,599
to the production lab and and then

880
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,820
finally we have ran a pilot in a live

881
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:22,140
network uh two weeks ago one week ago so

882
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,320
the the work is yet ongoing in terms of

883
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,540
processing the information and this is

884
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,820
what I will present to you so what we

885
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,579
did between 90f114 and idea15 was

886
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,400
essentially to put the the alto into the

887
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,920
production networks of fitting all the

888
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,839
security stuff the server installation

889
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,180
the definition of the flows how to

890
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,099
connect with our reflectors and so on so

891
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:45,540
far

892
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,680
so next please

893
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,820
there was at the time of running in the

894
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,079
parade there was an initial constraint

895
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,380
an initial restriction so this is a kind

896
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,720
of of level shows you are a basic

897
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,780
topology basic hierarchy that we have in

898
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,240
telephonical network so we have more or

899
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,400
less one to five levels in some cases

900
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,280
six depends on the size of the country

901
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,380
the being the level one interconnection

902
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,079
within the the lower part the SLC router

903
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,020
so uh between the backbone level I mean

904
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,660
the the mesh of the routers and

905
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,700
connecting or moving the traffic in a

906
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,700
national uh in the National footprint

907
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,859
and connected with the different regions

908
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,500
we have some issue with one of the

909
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,200
vendors one of the rotor vendors the

910
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,300
ability system that we have the dealing

911
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,640
support or had promised for supporting

912
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,200
bgpls

913
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,480
um for ospf so we are trying to fix that

914
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,540
this was an initial uh constraint so we

915
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,460
know in advance that we will not collect

916
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,800
or we will not be able to collect in

917
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,300
this point or to retrieve in this point

918
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,700
the complete topology but at least we

919
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,119
have a region that is completely we have

920
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,579
all this over there so at least this

921
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,760
would be let's say the the the the POC

922
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,420
we will be focused on this region by now

923
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,820
next please

924
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,560
so after uh realizing the book The Pilot

925
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,020
so in a preliminary analysis that we are

926
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,180
running we have some good news and not

927
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,339
so good news so we present first the

928
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:21,300
good news so we are retrieving uh a good

929
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,640
amount of summarize summarize IP address

930
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,480
ranges so these are

931
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,800
ranges that are used for fixed mobile

932
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,400
and Enterprise this is more or less as

933
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,480
expected

934
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,720
also as one of the IP ranges are

935
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,119
external this is understandable ones

936
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,800
that we are collecting and are those for

937
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,940
the in the for the national

938
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,280
interconnection the point is in the

939
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,240
telephonic and international

940
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,020
interconnection is is run by a career a

941
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,579
tier one career also from the

942
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,500
telephonical group so what we are

943
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,880
collecting here is only the national

944
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,740
interconnections that are being run by

945
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,260
this operation in telefonica

946
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,839
this is good because

947
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,000
in the telephonica CDN is serving also

948
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,160
traffic to external customers so it's

949
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,859
good to have a a view of those that are

950
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,200
not from telephonica side if we have in

951
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,400
the National interconnection or in

952
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,140
international interconnection is

953
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,579
certainly true that this could be

954
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,980
obtained by other means but here we

955
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,900
could have an automatic automatized way

956
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,800
of of collecting and and aggressive

957
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,540
retrieving information that those

958
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,760
customers are rich by certain nodes that

959
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,500
are serving the national interconnection

960
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,000
so we could optimize the traffic also

961
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,859
for those external customers that are

962
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:34,560
not part of telefonica

963
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,420
the available information in the course

964
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,760
map is currently retrieved as well and

965
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,220
reflects the defined IEP metrics so that

966
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,980
is working fine so we are not taking

967
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,960
only the number of hops but also we are

968
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,119
taking the the proper geometric defined

969
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,180
on those links between the nodes and

970
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,460
from the perspective of the alto server

971
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,320
itself the the load of the service is

972
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,180
not significant so we are retrieving all

973
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,740
the topology even though we cannot

974
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,720
relate because we have that gap for the

975
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,819
VIP less the ospf that I mentioned

976
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:04,920
before we cannot Stitch let's say all

977
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,480
the nodes but we are retrieving the

978
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,800
information from all the nodes and the

979
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,319
load of the server is not not high so it

980
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,520
seems to be sufficiently I mean scalable

981
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,099
so next please

982
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,560
in this slide I show you just an example

983
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,060
of the network map retrieve the real

984
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,660
level map and the real cost map uh

985
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,480
I put some asterisk on the pids just to

986
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,220
let's say

987
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,079
don't disclose let's say the the real

988
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,119
information of the network but you can

989
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,400
see the IP addresses from the phonica

990
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,680
site and also you can see the in the

991
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,720
cost map the actual igp metrics between

992
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,940
different mpids so this is being

993
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,700
collected properly at this point in time

994
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,040
so next please

995
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,319
they're not so good news or the the news

996
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,180
that uh well the points that we need to

997
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,940
to keep working on is that we don't have

998
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,940
information for some uh pops the four

999
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,619
percent of the pops we are not receiving

1000
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,359
information so we need to analyze what

1001
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,160
what are the particularities of these

1002
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,319
pops why these pops are not populating

1003
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,880
the information

1004
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,880
also some of the IP ranges seems not to

1005
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,980
be retrieved so we need to check we have

1006
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,900
the proper bgp sessions established so

1007
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,520
probably we could be the case that we

1008
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,760
need to connect to some

1009
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,680
other some additional root reflector so

1010
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,720
this is also understudy

1011
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,380
and probably a more complex problem is

1012
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,520
this the third one that we only have 27

1013
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,839
pids both in the network map and the

1014
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:32,819
cost map this could be the case of the

1015
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:34,920
ospf issue for the bgplse information

1016
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,079
that I mentioned before but we need to

1017
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,599
further Analyze This to to verify that

1018
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,280
this is the point

1019
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,460
and also the the latest one the pids for

1020
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,220
the CD CDN nodes the caches are not yet

1021
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,400
captured so probably probably is also a

1022
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,440
matter of connecting to a new reflector

1023
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,500
so this is as well under study so next

1024
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,680
please

1025
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,480
so as next steps for the pilot itself to

1026
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,400
understand the first point will be how

1027
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,440
to understand I mean understand how to

1028
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,480
consume the other information so how

1029
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,700
often so we need now to enter into their

1030
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,700
operability of the health information so

1031
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,040
yeah to define the frequency of

1032
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,839
Retribution topology analyzing the

1033
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,220
topology and uploading the topology

1034
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,760
automatically also we need to continue

1035
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,500
analyzing the information received to

1036
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,119
understand the Dynamics in a production

1037
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:25,800
Network so how the changes have

1038
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,920
reflected how how we can be sure that we

1039
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,839
don't lose let's say any any kind of

1040
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,280
change in the network

1041
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,460
also we need to debug the issues that

1042
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,960
could be funded in the process so this

1043
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,579
is a new process and we don't have an

1044
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,160
operational experience on that and then

1045
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,079
we need to wait for sure until the

1046
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:44,640
resolution of the operating system of

1047
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,240
this router vendor to be ready for

1048
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,560
having the possibility of a stitch in

1049
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,380
all the areas all the pids and

1050
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,240
completely see the map of all the

1051
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,359
network

1052
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,400
foreignification of Alto so making make

1053
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,099
some developments on how to and create a

1054
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,460
component that could run smoothly in an

1055
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,839
operational Network

1056
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,300
uh so all the security concerns the

1057
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,099
logins all the kind of this kind of

1058
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,020
stuff the logs and so

1059
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,020
and and then also to work on the uh

1060
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,180
loading automatically the topology into

1061
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,040
the logic of the telephonica CDN so by

1062
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,560
now we can retrieve the the topology but

1063
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,040
there is just tending to uh to interest

1064
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,660
me to work let's say

1065
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,460
to integrate that with the logic of the

1066
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,020
telefonica CDN in such a way that could

1067
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,060
be essentially automatically done

1068
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,579
working group the intention is to

1069
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,319
document the pilot so I'm not sure if

1070
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,640
this could be also interesting for for

1071
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,599
mobs uh second step is to identify gaps

1072
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,160
issues and improvements in the solution

1073
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,579
for instance we are now

1074
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,839
seeing that probably we need to lose

1075
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,599
something into the security part so so

1076
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:03,720
how obfuscate the the pids and so if we

1077
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,700
are exposing this to third parties so

1078
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,859
that would be a matter to let's say no

1079
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:10,859
not reveal a sensible information

1080
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:13,079
and then well and the next step finally

1081
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:14,520
step for sure is to provide another

1082
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,160
update if possible in the next ITF and

1083
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,780
hopefully with all the solves the issue

1084
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,180
let's see if we are able to do to do

1085
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,520
that and I think that that was the

1086
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,140
biggest one

1087
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,420
so thank you

1088
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,640
thank you very much

1089
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:35,000
um so any questions from remote or local

1090
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,520
what are you sure do you plan to work

1091
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:47,599
with the other uh Telecom operator also

1092
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:51,420
you mean to work in terms of sharing the

1093
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,000
development

1094
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,300
or exposing yes for instance uh

1095
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,619
interconnecting some Alto Maps or that

1096
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,619
that well there are no plans by now

1097
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,839
because this is let's say in internal

1098
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,599
project for the CDN but uh once we have

1099
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,839
the the alto in place we could consider

1100
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:14,640
to transport that topology to third

1101
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,040
parties for sure but there is no a plan

1102
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,440
for that right now

1103
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,240
some capabilities should be incorporated

1104
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,640
they probably to filter some parts of

1105
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,780
the topology and so this I mean as as it

1106
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,180
is now probably would not be the way of

1107
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,579
of sharing with other operators

1108
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:34,500
further work could be required for

1109
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,940
filtering things and and so

1110
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,420
thank you and all again encourage people

1111
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,119
to use the Meade Echo Q for asking

1112
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,420
questions

1113
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:52,260
yes as as ours our Note Taker says

1114
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,180
otherwise they show up as participant so

1115
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,560
you lose your Fame and Glory

1116
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,200
all right okay thank you thank you very

1117
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,640
much

1118
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,060
okay then moving right along uh we have

1119
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,520
a remote presentation now

1120
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,319
um I believe he's remote anyway Lenny

1121
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,220
are you ready to go

1122
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,359
yes I am

1123
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,900
so uh should I request to drive the

1124
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:29,240
slides or just tell you to advance them

1125
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,839
and you want to if you want to share all

1126
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,520
if you want to share I'll stop sharing

1127
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,280
money just use the uh use the sharing

1128
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,700
tool

1129
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,500
there you go

1130
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,500
and

1131
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,300
okay looks good

1132
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,099
all right

1133
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:58,940
can you hear me okay

1134
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,960
this is I'm sorry uh Kyle is my audio

1135
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,660
good can you hear me

1136
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,000
sounds good over here

1137
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,680
great

1138
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,099
all right thank you so um

1139
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:20,160
uh we'd like to present uh today

1140
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,859
um our draft on treaty end which is a

1141
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:25,319
tree based cdns

1142
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:27,480
um which is an architecture optimized

1143
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,180
for live streaming to mass audiences

1144
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,160
um the problem we're trying to solve

1145
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,560
with treaty in is um

1146
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,960
are we

1147
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,720
are are we at a you know unique uh

1148
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,640
perhaps inflection point for the

1149
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,900
internet

1150
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,200
um with live streaming audiences kind of

1151
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,140
exploding in size uh combine that with

1152
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,880
increasing size bit rates something that

1153
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,819
was talked about in previous

1154
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:58,260
uh talks today

1155
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,540
um

1156
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,020
uh are we at an inflection point for

1157
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,920
the resources consumed uh by

1158
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,940
um live streaming uh on the network

1159
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,079
um

1160
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:17,339
one recent uh kind of a perfect example

1161
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:18,180
is

1162
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,400
um for those not familiar uh Thursday

1163
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,319
night NFL Thursday night football which

1164
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,339
is American football is um in the last

1165
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:28,680
two months uh for the first time ever is

1166
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,200
being streamed exclusively over the

1167
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,460
Internet

1168
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,880
um Amazon Prime uh announced that the

1169
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,339
first game which was in mid-september

1170
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:42,859
had I believe over 11 million uh

1171
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:48,720
uh stream uh streams for that event

1172
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,740
so the question is uh in you know for

1173
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,420
those not familiar with American

1174
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,040
football it's kind of the closest thing

1175
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,000
to

1176
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,400
a national religion in the U.S

1177
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,720
um

1178
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,839
um so with with events like this uh

1179
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:04,980
occurring

1180
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,980
um and and becoming more common uh

1181
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,240
across the internet

1182
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,559
um like I said are we at a new

1183
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,480
collection Point um if not now will we

1184
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,680
ever be

1185
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,819
um and if the answer to either those

1186
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:16,800
questions is yes uh the question is what

1187
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,540
should we do

1188
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,920
um one thing to keep in mind is live

1189
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,280
streaming is is has a unique set of uh

1190
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,579
requirement characteristics

1191
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:29,280
um that are different from say on-demand

1192
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,380
streaming um you know they're

1193
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,020
some folks have said hey what's the

1194
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,480
difference between live streaming versus

1195
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,400
uh you know people just watching

1196
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,640
on-demand movies you know on Netflix

1197
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,619
um

1198
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:45,720
uh you know if if people are going to be

1199
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,119
watching you know there's a fair amount

1200
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:50,160
of saturation and people are on a given

1201
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,359
evening they're probably going to be

1202
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,500
watching something what's the difference

1203
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,260
whether it's uh a live stream of a game

1204
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,200
versus um you know a movie

1205
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,000
um and when it comes to live streaming

1206
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,160
particularly of you know say sporting

1207
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,420
events it's the most

1208
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,000
you know obvious use case

1209
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,980
um there's an expectation of of lower

1210
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,180
latency

1211
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,099
um so

1212
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:13,380
um for example if you have you know if

1213
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,119
you're watching a movie you can live

1214
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,339
with a minute or two play out buffer um

1215
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:18,839
you know the movie was made perhaps

1216
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:20,400
years ago

1217
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,760
um so uh on the other hand if it's a if

1218
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,319
it's a sporting event

1219
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,240
um you know much longer than say you

1220
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,680
know 10 seconds the traditional

1221
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,960
broadcast television has had

1222
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,960
um you run the risk that uh you can get

1223
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,460
a text message from your friend saying

1224
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,720
man what an incredible you know

1225
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,460
game-winning score

1226
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,440
um you know a minute or so before it

1227
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,540
actually happens or you hear people

1228
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,180
cheering next door or at a bar before

1229
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,119
you know a minute before you see what

1230
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:49,680
happens

1231
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,260
um and then you know that for for uh use

1232
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,000
cases on things like in-game micro

1233
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,500
betting

1234
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,540
um the the latency requirements are even

1235
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,819
tighter um

1236
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,220
the other thing is uh join rates and

1237
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,540
traffic rates are vastly different

1238
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,180
depending on demand and live streaming

1239
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,839
um if you look at the typical uh traffic

1240
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,040
streams

1241
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,559
um on a service provider what you'll see

1242
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:17,040
is kind of a very smooth predictable

1243
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,520
um uh growth rate there's you know we've

1244
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,319
all seen kind of those diurnal patterns

1245
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,900
of you know it starts out at about 9 00

1246
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,599
a.m and Rises till about five and then

1247
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,940
drops and then about 8 P.M up till about

1248
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,980
midnight

1249
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,020
you see a much higher Spike and that

1250
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,880
corresponds to people watching stuff uh

1251
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,140
streaming content

1252
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,119
um over the Internet

1253
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:45,180
um it's it's it's it's significant but

1254
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,619
predictable

1255
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,059
um on the other hand if you know for

1256
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:50,099
sporting events it can resemble more of

1257
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:51,839
like a step function

1258
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,420
um as everybody Tunes in uh and tries to

1259
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,059
join a stream you know right at game

1260
00:54:57,059 --> 00:54:58,680
time

1261
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,480
um so

1262
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,540
um

1263
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,640
how do we solve it

1264
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,520
um or how do we address this uh in terms

1265
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,920
of network-based replication

1266
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,579
um

1267
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,559
you know this is a much more efficient

1268
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:16,859
way of of uh delivering this content

1269
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:19,500
um and and specifically multicast uh has

1270
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,940
been you know this is what multicast is

1271
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,140
out there for

1272
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,599
um and it has been fairly successful in

1273
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,400
some use cases

1274
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,079
um it's absolutely vital in financial

1275
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,300
networks uh for video distribution

1276
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,240
networks it's commonly used as well as

1277
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,700
you know VPN service providers and some

1278
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,839
Enterprises

1279
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:40,020
um it's it's uh it's a must-have uh

1280
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,720
solution in it and it is it is used

1281
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,459
um uh in these places

1282
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,599
however on the internet in terms of

1283
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:52,099
internet multicast not so much it has uh

1284
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,619
hasn't had the best story for Success uh

1285
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:58,440
over the last uh two plus decades

1286
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,240
so it's worth asking you know what what

1287
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,339
went wrong uh when it comes to internet

1288
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:04,859
multicasts and you know is this a viable

1289
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:08,960
option for this type of content

1290
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,819
um

1291
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:14,760
there have been uh over the years you

1292
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,079
know the best best way to describe the

1293
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,520
issues with with

1294
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,680
um internet multicast has been it's been

1295
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,839
kind of like three main problems with

1296
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,280
Internet multicast one is the All or

1297
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,440
Nothing problem uh and that is for for

1298
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,300
multicast the work you need every single

1299
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,119
layer three hop uh

1300
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,880
between the source and destination to be

1301
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,740
multicast enabled needs to be running

1302
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,700
some type of multicast routing protocol

1303
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,819
and it turns out having

1304
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:43,880
every single

1305
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,500
interface on every single router and

1306
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,780
firewall on the internet running a

1307
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,220
complex set of protocols is a pretty

1308
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,480
high bar and it's it's uh it's proven to

1309
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,579
be really really difficult to get

1310
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,220
everyone to do something uh like I said

1311
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,220
I think V6 has has a similar problem

1312
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,460
um anything that requires you know that

1313
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,520
kind of level of change on the Internet

1314
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,640
ubiquitously is going to struggle for

1315
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,800
traction and deployment

1316
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,339
um the second problem uh has been you

1317
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:18,540
know anybody who's familiar with

1318
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,900
multicast is is probably aware of the

1319
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,059
the challenges and the complexities of

1320
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:27,480
of uh of deploying and operating a

1321
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,980
multicast network

1322
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,220
um operators have long complained that

1323
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,640
you know the the protocols uh are really

1324
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,740
complex and it's too difficult and too

1325
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:41,220
difficult to deploy operate troubleshoot

1326
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,800
um and uh you know they've they've

1327
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,300
complained for for years that just

1328
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,280
multicast is just too complex

1329
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,599
and then of course there's the chicken

1330
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,760
and egg problem which is

1331
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,780
um you know there's no multicast

1332
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,280
audience because there's no multicast

1333
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,300
content

1334
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,040
and there's no multicast content because

1335
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,079
there's no multicast audience

1336
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,359
so uh the good news is there have been

1337
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:02,880
recent developments uh in network

1338
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,920
replication Technologies uh that are

1339
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,260
available today uh to address these

1340
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,140
problems so you know these you know the

1341
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:13,500
the uh it's not your your grandfather's

1342
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,400
internet multicast uh Solutions today we

1343
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,220
now have solutions that address these

1344
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,720
problems

1345
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,359
um and I'll kind of go through those

1346
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:27,660
so what is tree treaty end um

1347
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,680
uh tree-based cdns uh it leverages

1348
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,480
um

1349
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,000
advances in uh and developments in

1350
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,859
Native Technologies as well as overlay

1351
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:40,859
Concepts to deliver a service to end

1352
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:41,940
users

1353
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,859
even where parts of the network don't

1354
00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:45,540
support multicast

1355
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,400
um so if we kind of divide the problem

1356
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,819
up to uh there's the native component of

1357
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,040
the network

1358
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,839
as well as the overlay let's talk about

1359
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:57,059
the native part

1360
00:58:57,059 --> 00:58:59,520
um what treaty n prescribes is on the

1361
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,099
native part of the uh of the network

1362
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:03,780
that is the part the part of the network

1363
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,980
that supports uh IP multicast natively

1364
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,880
um to use SSM Source specific multicast

1365
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,579
um it turns out uh

1366
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:16,260
the complexity that folks have

1367
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,020
complained about with multicast

1368
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,000
it's it's not that multicast is too

1369
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,520
complex it's that ASM is too complex

1370
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,319
which is any source multicast which is

1371
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:28,260
the traditional model for multitask

1372
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,920
um SSM uh is source-specific multicast

1373
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,280
um and it vastly simplifies uh the the

1374
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,440
deployment of multicast

1375
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,500
um and uh with with SSM you eliminate a

1376
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,540
lot of the complexities and headaches of

1377
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,700
multicast things like um Rendezvous

1378
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,540
points and msdp and

1379
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:52,040
shared trees Pim register messages

1380
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,680
register end cap dcap uh tree switch

1381
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,900
over

1382
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,220
data-driven State events all of those

1383
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:03,119
things which comprise probably you know

1384
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,099
more than 90 of the complexity of

1385
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:08,400
multitask get eliminated um in SSM

1386
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,099
SSM can be delivered it's most often

1387
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:15,660
delivered by Pim SSM but could use any

1388
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,960
um any protocol uh any multicast routing

1389
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,400
protocol

1390
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,700
um or uh delivery mechanism uh data

1391
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,040
plane delivery mechanism

1392
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,540
um the point is uh if you just use SSM

1393
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,040
you can address the most common use

1394
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,339
cases and eliminate a lot of the

1395
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:38,579
complexity of multicast deployment

1396
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:41,339
the second key component of treaty n is

1397
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:43,200
overlays

1398
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,500
um and uh

1399
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:49,079
automatic multicast tunneling AMT which

1400
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:54,119
is described in RFC 7450 is a technology

1401
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:58,559
that dynamically builds tunnels uh from

1402
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,359
end hosts

1403
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:01,260
um

1404
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,720
you know a laptop smartphone iPad

1405
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:08,520
whatever and it it it enables the um

1406
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:13,319
uh tunneling from uh end devices to uh

1407
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:15,599
the multi to the border of the multicast

1408
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,220
enabled Network

1409
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,319
um so it allows

1410
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:22,619
users on unicast only networks unicast

1411
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:25,400
only parts of the network to Tunnel

1412
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,040
dynamically to uh the the edge of the

1413
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,680
multicast network and receive content so

1414
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,420
this enables

1415
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,700
any and everyone uh who is on the

1416
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:39,000
internet with AMT is able to receive

1417
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,920
multicast content even if they are not

1418
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,200
on a multicast enabled Network

1419
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,339
um so this solves the All or Nothing

1420
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:46,920
problem that fundamental uh you know

1421
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,780
probably the biggest of the three Pro by

1422
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,119
far uh problem of All or Nothing also

1423
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,440
solves the chicken and egg problem

1424
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,520
because

1425
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,400
um with AMT

1426
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,839
um potentially any uh every single

1427
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:03,119
um post on the Internet is a potential

1428
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,220
audience member

1429
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,880
um am AMT is the most uh common has some

1430
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,260
really nice benefits because it's a

1431
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,780
dynamically built tunnel it can be

1432
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,359
integrated into the application uh or in

1433
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,040
the host stack

1434
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,760
um

1435
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,280
uh but uh any other

1436
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,319
um uh overlay networking technology

1437
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,079
could also be used something like lisp

1438
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:28,260
um you know is another uh uh overlay

1439
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,900
technology that could also be um uh

1440
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,940
leveraged um for for this component of

1441
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,440
the network

1442
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,980
um the key thing is treaty n uh provides

1443
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,559
you know a significant benefit that

1444
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,260
previously was not available

1445
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,940
um with multicast which is incremental

1446
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,260
deployment

1447
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,000
um

1448
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,799
for those parts of the network that are

1449
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,480
multicast enabled they enjoy the

1450
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,760
benefits of multicast and for the rest

1451
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,160
of the network that is unicast only

1452
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,380
um we simply we simply tunnel over those

1453
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,599
parts of the network so end users

1454
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:03,540
receive the service regardless of uh

1455
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:07,260
what the what the topology looks like

1456
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,099
um

1457
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:10,799
and uh you know significantly end users

1458
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,839
are not dependent on their last mile

1459
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:15,720
provider uh to the to support multicast

1460
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,098
in order for them to receive the content

1461
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,559
so here's kind of a a 30 000 foot view

1462
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,740
of what treaty end looks like and

1463
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,480
they they

1464
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,880
um those familiar with IP multicast

1465
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,200
technologies will notice that there's

1466
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,040
there's no there's nothing

1467
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,780
groundbreaking or really new from a

1468
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,760
protocol standpoint it's really the

1469
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,980
synthesis of existing tools and existing

1470
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,859
protocols uh to Define an architecture

1471
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,440
and describe an architecture that

1472
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,619
operators can leverage and service

1473
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:49,020
providers can use to deliver new

1474
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:52,799
Services uh for customers and end users

1475
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,079
so we can see here you have the big eye

1476
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:56,280
internet

1477
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:59,520
um and uh the the uh within that a

1478
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,140
smaller subset of the network that is

1479
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,760
multicast enabled traditionally we've

1480
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,799
called this the M bone which is the

1481
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,859
multicast enabled part of the internet

1482
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:09,299
um but you can imagine you have a treaty

1483
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:13,380
and provider uh that uh the the green

1484
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,839
part of the that green cloud is a native

1485
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,940
multicast enabled Network you have a

1486
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,099
content provider uh pushing out

1487
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:23,760
multitask content and that traffic is

1488
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,099
delivered natively uh within the green

1489
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:28,200
part of the network and if you have

1490
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,599
receivers who are off net who are on

1491
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:33,480
unicast only networks we use AMT to

1492
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,960
tunnel and deliver that traffic to them

1493
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,180
that's kind of the high level view of

1494
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,520
the whole internet and where treaty n uh

1495
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,119
fits within that ecosystem

1496
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,819
um kind of drilling down into you know

1497
01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:49,260
what does

1498
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,579
um you know what would the treaty end

1499
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:53,160
part look like um let's compare it a

1500
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,579
treaty end to a CDN without multicast

1501
01:04:55,579 --> 01:04:58,740
there's different models for cdns but a

1502
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,680
common one is you have a uh An Origin a

1503
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,079
source with content that kind of pushes

1504
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,540
it out to CDN boxes

1505
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,220
um pushes it to one and they kind of

1506
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,859
distribute it and those CDN boxes that

1507
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:12,619
are deployed throughout the network

1508
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:16,500
handle local receivers

1509
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,780
uh much more scalable than unicast

1510
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,960
obviously uh and has the nice benefit of

1511
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,400
not requiring

1512
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,040
um you know just works over the Internet

1513
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,780
doesn't require

1514
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,640
um you know a set of uh it doesn't

1515
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,440
require multicast protocols to make it

1516
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,900
work so that's why it's been popular

1517
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,380
um that said uh you know with treaty end

1518
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:40,260
to compare with uh cdns without

1519
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,619
multicast we can rename these those CDN

1520
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:46,619
boxes we'll call them AMT relays push

1521
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:49,760
them out to the Border uh of the network

1522
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,640
and they deliver traffic notice that the

1523
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,160
the the the multicast tree gets

1524
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,040
delivered natively from The Source uh to

1525
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,799
those AMT receivers uh I'm sorry those

1526
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:04,819
AMT relays who handle remote

1527
01:06:04,819 --> 01:06:08,640
local receivers

1528
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,960
um the different you know some of the

1529
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,640
differences one like I said it's uh

1530
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,599
pushes

1531
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:13,200
um

1532
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,380
the uh the replication points um to the

1533
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,500
uh to the Border uh of the multicast

1534
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,480
enabled Network it also delivers only

1535
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,119
two relays that have um interested local

1536
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:25,500
receivers

1537
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,960
um if if there are no interested

1538
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,119
receivers in an area uh those relays

1539
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:34,200
will not um uh participate in the tree

1540
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,539
um and the key difference the key value

1541
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:38,280
is

1542
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,599
um if those

1543
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,740
AMT relays are deployed on existing

1544
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,380
Network infrastructure

1545
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,780
um it's essentially a CDN on a chip uh

1546
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,880
this there are

1547
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,059
um routing router platforms out there uh

1548
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:57,059
that support AMT tunneling natively and

1549
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:58,319
what that means is

1550
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:01,260
you if you have these devices in your

1551
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:02,760
network at the borders of your network

1552
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,400
say it period points or Edge routers

1553
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,559
you can offer this service at

1554
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:10,260
essentially zero cost at only the cost

1555
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,180
of configuring a few lines of config on

1556
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,640
your on your routers so it's essentially

1557
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,700
zero capex and you can argue you know

1558
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,160
zero Opex because you're not you know

1559
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,920
typically CDN boxes in these you know a

1560
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,740
stack of x86 boxes that are

1561
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,420
sitting in a network that need to be

1562
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,160
racked and powered and plugged into

1563
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,680
Revenue generating ports

1564
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,660
um on on routers and the network

1565
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:36,359
infrastructure we eliminate that

1566
01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:39,240
um when it's when it's built directly in

1567
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,460
and available in the existing

1568
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,500
infrastructure so

1569
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,480
um you get uh the benefits without

1570
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,780
having to deploy any new any new boxes

1571
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:52,160
so that's the key uh benefit of using

1572
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,859
cdns with uh multicast or treaty ends as

1573
01:07:55,859 --> 01:07:59,220
opposed to without

1574
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,119
um so in terms of the benefits of treaty

1575
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:04,140
end

1576
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,839
one you get the more efficient uh

1577
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:09,660
utilization of the network

1578
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,599
um and Resources by using

1579
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:13,920
um

1580
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,339
uh the latest and greatest capabilities

1581
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:20,640
in network-based replication

1582
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,160
um we're not just talking about scaling

1583
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,520
to support existing

1584
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,040
existing content but

1585
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,759
um really it it also more importantly

1586
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:35,219
scales to make new content uh viable and

1587
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:38,160
available so think about

1588
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,560
um live streaming of AR to mass

1589
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,000
audiences

1590
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,679
um you know we saw some of the some of

1591
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:44,939
those numbers

1592
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:47,640
um discussed uh in an earlier talk

1593
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,339
um uh this morning

1594
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:53,100
um what if you wanted to

1595
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,920
live stream in AR

1596
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,660
um you know the experience of sitting

1597
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:01,080
Courtside uh at a you know front front

1598
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,500
row Center Court at a basketball game or

1599
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,040
a you know a soccer football game uh

1600
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,660
what it's like to to sit in the stadium

1601
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,939
and and you look left and right we see

1602
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,279
the crowd and you see the game as if

1603
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:15,719
you're there and

1604
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:18,120
um what if you wanted to to deliver

1605
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,859
those those streams uh live to mass

1606
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:25,439
audiences of thousands tens of thousands

1607
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,939
perhaps Millions

1608
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:29,100
um could the internet do that today

1609
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,080
uh if so would be really really

1610
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,339
expensive

1611
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:35,819
um with uh treaty n uh this is something

1612
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:37,679
that can be trivially done because the

1613
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,620
network need only a given link need only

1614
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:43,259
be able to support uh enough bandwidth

1615
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:46,100
to handle a single stream

1616
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:49,380
um it enables uh service providers and

1617
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:52,198
operators to offer new Services uh

1618
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:54,600
replication as a service send us your

1619
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,000
content we'll replicate it and we'll

1620
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,120
deliver that to uh to end users I mean

1621
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,380
essentially this is what cdns have

1622
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,840
always been uh but

1623
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,760
um what's what's key here it is it

1624
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,120
allows operators

1625
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,100
to offer this service at potentially

1626
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,100
zero cost to deliver the service

1627
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,739
um if existing infrastructure already

1628
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:19,020
supports AMT

1629
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,080
uh it's also an open open

1630
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,520
standards-based architecture uh that's

1631
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,860
used using um that's leveraging widely

1632
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,780
available protocols

1633
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,360
um as opposed to some uh

1634
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,120
uh you know CDN technologies that are

1635
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,300
kind of uh proprietary or specific to

1636
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,179
certain operators

1637
01:10:38,179 --> 01:10:40,440
and it also requires far less

1638
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,420
coordination between the content

1639
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,480
provider and CDN

1640
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,980
essentially you know with treaty end the

1641
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,739
CDN is just forwarding packets there's

1642
01:10:49,739 --> 01:10:52,500
no need for storage or data protection

1643
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,260
or key management things like that just

1644
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,120
just pushing out packets

1645
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,760
uh the other nice uh part of this

1646
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,400
technology is it is a democratizing and

1647
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,260
decentral it's it's a decentralized

1648
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,480
architecture

1649
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,100
um which uh essentially makes it

1650
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,219
exceedingly inexpensive uh for sources

1651
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:15,780
to

1652
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,699
um send

1653
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:21,179
High data rate streams uh to met to an

1654
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:23,340
arbitrarily large audience

1655
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,679
um you know most of the Technologies and

1656
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,420
solutions available today on the

1657
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,500
internet

1658
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,260
um are dependent on uh you know a small

1659
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,179
handful of companies and you know is it

1660
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:35,280
is it healthy for the internet and

1661
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,960
society that

1662
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,580
um you know the only way to distribute

1663
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,739
live stream content to large audiences

1664
01:11:40,739 --> 01:11:44,100
is a really viable way is through a

1665
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,400
handful of um of of companies uh to

1666
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,020
distribute that content

1667
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:50,960
um this is a

1668
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,340
decentralized and democratizing

1669
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,260
technology for

1670
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,840
um uh content distribution

1671
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,520
um in terms of use cases and applicable

1672
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,140
applicability

1673
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,219
um

1674
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:07,500
I focused on

1675
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,159
um

1676
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,020
live streaming a video because that's

1677
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,820
kind of the sexiest and most interesting

1678
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,199
uh use case but really it's it's it's

1679
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,880
applicable for any any traffic that

1680
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,820
needs to go to multiple destinations

1681
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,800
um so live streaming isn't the obvious

1682
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,040
and you know sexiest uh use cases

1683
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,600
um you know typically Multimedia Audio

1684
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,960
Video specifically AR uh could also be

1685
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,640
Telemetry data

1686
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,460
um from things like uh you know imagine

1687
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,300
weather satellites that need to push out

1688
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,040
real-time Telemetry data to research

1689
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,940
institutions that's uh one use case

1690
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,219
um but there's also a large file uh

1691
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:50,179
software updates things like OS upgrades

1692
01:12:50,179 --> 01:12:52,679
those are you know things that can

1693
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:54,600
really crush a network when you have a

1694
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,880
you know uh

1695
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,100
an OS upgrade that needs to go out to

1696
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,480
say you know

1697
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,000
tens of hundreds of millions of devices

1698
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,120
say the latest IOS upgrade

1699
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,040
so

1700
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,300
um it's really you know any

1701
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,140
multi-destination traffic

1702
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:15,360
so kind of the to summarize what what is

1703
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,159
treaty end

1704
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,620
um it's really about

1705
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,880
um

1706
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,800
kind of the the there's there's these

1707
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,280
Crossing of supply and demand curves

1708
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,620
um when it comes to live streaming on

1709
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:29,640
the internet

1710
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,280
um on the demand side uh it's really

1711
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,620
that combination of exploding audience

1712
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:38,219
sizes combined with increasing bit rates

1713
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:42,120
um to to generate you know large amounts

1714
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,620
of Demand on the internet for live

1715
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,600
streaming and

1716
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,100
um the potential uh

1717
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,840
resource consumption implications on the

1718
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,620
network

1719
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:54,719
and on the supply side

1720
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,940
um you know for for those who kind of

1721
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:59,100
tuned out and said you know 15 years ago

1722
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,719
and said you know multicast isn't viable

1723
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,360
let's let's not waste our time on this

1724
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,520
um you know there have been uh

1725
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,500
developments in evolution

1726
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,679
um in in how uh multicast can can

1727
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:12,780
replicate across the Trap across the

1728
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:15,480
internet and address the issues that you

1729
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,460
know plagued internet multicast

1730
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:21,000
um you know uh in in previous decades um

1731
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
so it is now

1732
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,940
easier uh to deploy and more available

1733
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:29,940
and useful than ever so it's really kind

1734
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:32,820
of the the synthesis of existing tools

1735
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,800
to address

1736
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,400
um you know a very recent phenomena uh

1737
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,199
where you know

1738
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:40,739
um

1739
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:43,199
live streaming is consuming significant

1740
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,199
amounts of resources in the networks

1741
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,280
and that's what that's what treaty end

1742
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,100
is it describes a CDN model

1743
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:52,860
to address uh this type of content that

1744
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:55,320
is putting increasing strain on uh on

1745
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,120
the network

1746
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,739
not only for the content of today but

1747
01:14:58,739 --> 01:14:59,760
also

1748
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,400
um you know enables new content from

1749
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,280
potentially new uh new sources for

1750
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,840
tomorrow

1751
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,580
um in terms of Next Step

1752
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,920
um we'll be presenting this at mbon d as

1753
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,140
well um but uh we're we're looking for

1754
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,719
working group adoption

1755
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:18,120
um is this something that uh you know

1756
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,760
I've looked at mops the the uh

1757
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,100
the charter for mocks and and I I think

1758
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,239
we're

1759
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:26,640
um we'd be open to mops or MBD but to me

1760
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,440
it looks like mops uh based on the

1761
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,580
charter

1762
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,920
um seems like the more appropriate place

1763
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,260
um there's a lot more

1764
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,980
um expertise in the CDN area so we'd

1765
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,199
love to see if mops is interested in

1766
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:42,120
adapting this work

1767
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,560
with that I'd be happy to take any

1768
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,719
questions

1769
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:49,320
thank you and uh Kyle is first in the

1770
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,060
queue

1771
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,739
thank you Leslie

1772
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:55,560
um so uh I'm speaking as uh you know

1773
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,420
with Hats Off not as chair here I have a

1774
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,880
a couple of points um so I read the I

1775
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,500
read the draft when you initially uh

1776
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:05,460
made the request to uh to presented mops

1777
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,360
um and I thought it was really

1778
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,780
interesting the presentation here has

1779
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:12,060
um has uh answered a bunch of the

1780
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,800
questions that I had after reading the

1781
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,140
draft but I still have some I still have

1782
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:18,060
some issues um and I don't know if we

1783
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,280
want to go into all of these at the

1784
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,380
moment um but I can maybe outline what I

1785
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:26,219
was thinking so the the issue of or the

1786
01:16:26,219 --> 01:16:27,719
the benefit that you say about a

1787
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:30,239
democratizing Content distribution is

1788
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,400
you know I take that as

1789
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,460
as uh like that's a good point

1790
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,040
um I'm not sure like that it that

1791
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,900
addresses democratization of

1792
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:44,100
availability of the of the the the sort

1793
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,260
of replication function the fan out

1794
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,520
function

1795
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,960
um it doesn't address the

1796
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,300
democratization of content right I mean

1797
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,120
there are rights holders that have you

1798
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,219
know that have access to that have

1799
01:16:56,219 --> 01:16:59,340
exclusive uh you know access to say

1800
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,560
sporting events and that's not gonna

1801
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,000
that's not gonna go away you're not

1802
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,620
going to be able to you know legally

1803
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,380
broadcast some some soccer game right

1804
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:08,820
that you don't have rights to broadcast

1805
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,380
I mean you might be able to do it

1806
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,880
technically but somebody will shut it

1807
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,280
down so there's that issue

1808
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,900
um but you also I mean there's a

1809
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,520
you're essentially you're introducing a

1810
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,020
novel attack surface when you have

1811
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:24,420
replication as a service and so not

1812
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:27,120
having any controls over that seems like

1813
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,699
it it at least requires a significant

1814
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:30,960
amount of thought to figure out how to

1815
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,300
avoid problems with that

1816
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,500
right

1817
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,600
the other the only other thing that that

1818
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,699
I that I was thinking of as a I mean I'm

1819
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:40,020
not trying to I'm not trying to throw

1820
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,340
cold water on this I'm just trying to

1821
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,020
bring up a bunch of a bunch of things

1822
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,699
that I thought of when I was when I was

1823
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:46,679
reading the the draft and listening to

1824
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:50,100
your presentation is uh the you know

1825
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,699
related to the the content rights issue

1826
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:56,460
is you say well you know there's no key

1827
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:58,440
management well that's not really true

1828
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,699
you're just kind of moving Key

1829
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:01,739
Management to another layer because the

1830
01:18:01,739 --> 01:18:04,620
cdns are required to only make the

1831
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,540
content available to people who are say

1832
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,960
paying subscribers in in that case

1833
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,340
um and there are related issues around

1834
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,040
privacy that you're going to run into

1835
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,679
when you try to integrate this into

1836
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:18,600
you know into say web protocols and this

1837
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,340
is something that that Jake and I were

1838
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:22,380
you know spent a lot of time

1839
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,600
trying to figure out how to address in a

1840
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,280
way that would

1841
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:29,120
not set off everyone

1842
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,860
that you know who over the past 10 years

1843
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,460
have put a ton of time and effort into

1844
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,679
into thinking about

1845
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,140
um you know what are what are the the

1846
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:43,800
consequences of outside observers being

1847
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,719
able to know what content you're

1848
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:47,219
consuming

1849
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:49,080
um and how do you you know how do you

1850
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,540
kind of fit that into the web security

1851
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:53,820
model and it's not there are a lot of

1852
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,320
subtleties there and I don't think we've

1853
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,940
even kind of teased them all out yet but

1854
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,679
I'm it's something that I'm happy to to

1855
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:02,280
help uh to help work on to to push this

1856
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,719
work forward

1857
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:05,340
um I just think that there there are a

1858
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,719
bunch of issues that are that remain

1859
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,640
unresolved that go well beyond the the

1860
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,280
technology that's essentially the you

1861
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,080
know like the the broad point I'm trying

1862
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,000
to make

1863
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,820
sure um so let me try to take uh all

1864
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,560
three of those and I I wrote them down

1865
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,880
it's

1866
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,860
it's kind of early and uh I'm I'm

1867
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,020
struggling to stay remain coaching so

1868
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,719
hopefully hopefully yeah

1869
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:29,820
yeah and I think maybe maybe what we

1870
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:31,620
want to do is just address them at a

1871
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,880
very high level and then I think they're

1872
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,140
I think they're pointers to questions

1873
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,239
that would need to get addressed

1874
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,300
gotcha uh in terms of content rights yes

1875
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,920
absolutely I think that goes without

1876
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,060
saying

1877
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,520
um you know you you can't legally

1878
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,260
broadcast something on the Internet it's

1879
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:47,940
content on the internet unless you have

1880
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:50,719
the rights to do so or or or or or

1881
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,600
rather the other way around uh you you

1882
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,940
can't legally broadcast something if you

1883
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:00,840
don't if if uh you are if someone else

1884
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,340
has rights to that

1885
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,560
um but from a democratizing technology

1886
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,580
think

1887
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,800
um all the content in the world that

1888
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,679
doesn't have uh that isn't restricted by

1889
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,300
um uh the content rights so imagine

1890
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:16,560
nature cams I imagine flying a

1891
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:21,239
flying a drone around uh or you know

1892
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:24,900
um uh or or

1893
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,460
um you know nature cams or or

1894
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:33,179
broadcasting the the the uh say sporting

1895
01:20:33,179 --> 01:20:34,980
events or other kinds of events that

1896
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,920
don't have uh rights explicit rights uh

1897
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,960
I think I think it goes without saying

1898
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,120
that you know

1899
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,159
democratizing techn the technology that

1900
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,080
democratizes something

1901
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,280
um is you know does so modulo the rights

1902
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,280
to actually deliver that content uh or

1903
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,159
to actually um broadcast that content

1904
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:57,620
um

1905
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,420
uh in terms of attack surface

1906
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:01,260
um

1907
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,420
multicast has a different attack surface

1908
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,219
uh than unicast

1909
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:08,219
um I wouldn't say that it's uh more

1910
01:21:08,219 --> 01:21:10,500
risky or less risky I think it's in some

1911
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,679
cases it is more uh it it just has

1912
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,179
different risks

1913
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:18,360
um so so for example uh things like

1914
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,620
spoofing

1915
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:22,560
um you know because multicast has

1916
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,000
uh RPF built into it naturally

1917
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,760
um you can you know eliminate lots of

1918
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,679
spoofing attacks um you know on the data

1919
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,820
plane so it's uh you know in some ways

1920
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:37,739
uh more resistant to certain data plane

1921
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:38,760
attacks

1922
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,239
um however it is

1923
01:21:41,239 --> 01:21:44,280
uh more vulnerable to say control plane

1924
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:47,340
attacks because you have users uh

1925
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:48,659
generating

1926
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:51,659
um uh control traffic uh on the network

1927
01:21:51,659 --> 01:21:53,520
in ways that you don't necessarily have

1928
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,460
with unicast so I don't know that it's

1929
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:00,179
uh more insecure or less insecure it's

1930
01:22:00,179 --> 01:22:01,920
just it has a different uh attack

1931
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,920
surface and there's lots and lots of um

1932
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,780
uh work over the years that kind of

1933
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:09,620
describes uh you know how to harden a a

1934
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:12,300
deployment uh to address some of those

1935
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,100
security issues

1936
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,659
and the last thing about the key

1937
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:18,960
management uh stuff that you mentioned

1938
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:19,940
um

1939
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:23,219
uh I guess what what I meant you know

1940
01:22:23,219 --> 01:22:25,679
what is meant there is

1941
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,840
um that there's you still have key

1942
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,880
management issues but it's it goes on

1943
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,080
between uh the the content provider and

1944
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,480
the end user so you can do things like

1945
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,640
encryption and you don't necessarily

1946
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:43,320
have to uh the the the intervening

1947
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,260
um players between say the CDN provider

1948
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,360
don't have to participate in that scheme

1949
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,440
but

1950
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,020
um you know it's it's it's certainly

1951
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,760
um you know for for example if you want

1952
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,340
to Source a stream and encrypt it and

1953
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,280
you know uh you need to

1954
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,460
distribute those decryption keys but you

1955
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,140
don't necessarily again need to

1956
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,360
coordinate with your CDN to to to do

1957
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,500
that um

1958
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,239
so that's kind of the CDN is just

1959
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:10,739
pushing packets

1960
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:12,840
um in terms of you know again I I don't

1961
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,360
think that's unique to multicast I think

1962
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:19,080
any broadcast technology uh where where

1963
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:24,980
traffic can be visible uh to multiple uh

1964
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:27,000
multiple end hosts that aren't

1965
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,860
necessarily entitled to receive that

1966
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,360
content

1967
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,920
um that's an issue so you know a good

1968
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,719
example is Wi-Fi

1969
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:35,280
um everybody on a Wi-Fi network and see

1970
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,440
those packets uh but

1971
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,820
um you can't necessarily make sense of

1972
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:41,040
them unless you have the ability to

1973
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,260
decrypt them

1974
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,360
um hopefully that answers your questions

1975
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,739
Kyle

1976
01:23:46,739 --> 01:23:50,659
or addresses those concerns sorry

1977
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,760
and and I'm happy to to talk more about

1978
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,219
this about this offline and I'm you know

1979
01:23:56,219 --> 01:23:57,960
having put a bunch of thought into this

1980
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,040
but

1981
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,219
um but yeah I mean it's it

1982
01:24:02,219 --> 01:24:03,480
yes

1983
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,960
thank you thanks uh Eric

1984
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,780
so everything the responsibility for

1985
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:12,060
mobs so regarding your last line on

1986
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,340
these slides it looks for me that

1987
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,380
document I still have to read it to be

1988
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,659
honest it looks more like best human

1989
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:21,300
practice or informational about oh you

1990
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:22,739
can stitch existing Technologies

1991
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:25,080
together so mobs would be the perfect

1992
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:28,020
working group for this right we are not

1993
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:29,820
allowed to do any kind of protocol work

1994
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:32,460
so if you need to do extension to AMT or

1995
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:35,520
whatever and Bone right but you're more

1996
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,040
than welcome here and I hope that Cal

1997
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,900
will write his questions on the mailing

1998
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:43,080
list and we got a review at this one now

1999
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,420
as an individual contributor I just

2000
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,880
wonder and I see your co-authors from

2001
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,679
Verizon so do you intend to run some

2002
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,420
proof of concept

2003
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,460
to get the scalability issue fixed for

2004
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:56,540
instance or identified

2005
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,940
um so uh

2006
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,739
uh the the

2007
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:04,679
um there are this is actually being you

2008
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:07,620
know in use and deployed today uh across

2009
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:10,320
the internet there there are providers

2010
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,580
um that uh uh and and uh I welcome you

2011
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:17,940
to join us in mbon d uh and um there's

2012
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:20,219
going to be an operator uh who will talk

2013
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:22,860
about how they're essentially doing

2014
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:23,880
um this

2015
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,520
uh in their Network on Wednesday morning

2016
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,320
so uh

2017
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,560
um yes this is and there has been a

2018
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,980
uh a a treaty and network that's been up

2019
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:35,880
and running

2020
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,159
um for the last few years

2021
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:41,400
um uh it's connected to Internet two and

2022
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,460
giant uh nodes

2023
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:47,040
um and has been uh delivering

2024
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,159
content using this um architecture uh

2025
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,780
for the last few years

2026
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,120
um so yeah we'd uh

2027
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:54,900
um

2028
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:59,639
uh it's it's uh not just um uh Verizon

2029
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:02,880
um uh but it's it's it's been it's been

2030
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,060
deployed by uh a number of operators

2031
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:07,739
um on the internet and

2032
01:26:07,739 --> 01:26:09,480
and that's not to say uh by the way I

2033
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:12,300
I'm not uh don't

2034
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:12,960
um

2035
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,120
I can't speak for my uh co-author in

2036
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,860
terms of what his company is doing in

2037
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:19,560
terms of whether they are aren't uh uh

2038
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,780
delivering this service but um

2039
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:23,699
uh it is being used on the internet

2040
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:25,620
today so this is really

2041
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,840
um as you said Eric there are new no new

2042
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,100
protocols here

2043
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,540
um if it was actually that would

2044
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:32,400
probably belong in Pim

2045
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,840
um and Bundy isn't allowed to work on

2046
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,159
protocols either

2047
01:26:35,159 --> 01:26:37,139
um uh but

2048
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:38,820
um there's there's no new protocols it's

2049
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:40,500
more about you know using existing

2050
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,300
protocols to deliver a service and

2051
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,560
here's how

2052
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,580
okay thank you

2053
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,000
thank you

2054
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,420
uh function from Huawei I wonder how

2055
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:52,400
this

2056
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,480
multicast interact with the

2057
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,000
transformative protocol for example if

2058
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,300
you are using TCP where does tcpn and

2059
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:04,820
then the Renee or or in the user

2060
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:08,760
um it definitely does not use TCP

2061
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,440
because it's multicast doesn't support

2062
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,679
TCP so it's typically UDP

2063
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:15,620
um

2064
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,360
were kind of agnostic to the transport

2065
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,120
as long as it's on IP multicast packet

2066
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,040
um so

2067
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,060
um

2068
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:28,199
any any uh let me put another way any

2069
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:30,480
non-tcp traffic

2070
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:35,100
um that uh uh is multicastable

2071
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,080
um Can can utilize this technology it's

2072
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,540
kind of agnostic to the um

2073
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:41,840
uh to what transport

2074
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,520
uh Protocols are used

2075
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,520
so the Renee only translates between the

2076
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,460
multicast and the unicast it doesn't

2077
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:54,840
aware of any upper nail protocol right

2078
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,600
uh it said that last part it's not aware

2079
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,679
of what

2080
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:00,080
um

2081
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:04,739
opening your protocol any any RDP UDP or

2082
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:07,380
or media transport protocol

2083
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:10,260
okay correct the relay is just uh

2084
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,920
so um it's just uh tunneling it takes a

2085
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,199
multicast packet in and sends it through

2086
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:17,280
a

2087
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,440
UDP unicast tunnel

2088
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,540
um and the end receiver receives that

2089
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,639
multicast packet so we're just pushing

2090
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:26,120
packets we're not um

2091
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:30,739
uh participating in in the transport

2092
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:36,840
all right

2093
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,100
thank you

2094
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,000
um

2095
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,460
so I think at this point we are

2096
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:43,320
looking at the last bullet on a slide

2097
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,360
and looking to see if there is interest

2098
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,940
in the parameters that Eric and Lenny

2099
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:50,580
discussed that this is focused on more

2100
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,440
or less best current practices and

2101
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,679
stitching together existing Technologies

2102
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,360
um I think what we'd like to do is take

2103
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,520
a assuming money you're still interested

2104
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,260
in seeing if mops is willing to take it

2105
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:03,179
as a working group item

2106
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:06,480
uh I think we should do a hum here and

2107
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,219
then take it to the mailing list to see

2108
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:10,560
if there is general interest

2109
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,080
so I'm not seeing any strong objections

2110
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,600
and some mild nods

2111
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,820
um all right so just a simple a simple

2112
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,100
hum or do we have to use do we have to

2113
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:23,340
use we should use the meat Echo yep all

2114
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:25,380
right so but the question is simple

2115
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:27,960
whether or not the answering it is

2116
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,040
um

2117
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:33,659
do do people uh at this meeting feel

2118
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:36,120
um that mocks should take up this work

2119
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,820
as a working group item

2120
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:41,340
yes or no

2121
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:43,820
yeah

2122
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,520
and again this is more or less to get a

2123
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,380
sense of things we will confirm on the

2124
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:54,860
mailing list

2125
01:30:15,179 --> 01:30:17,420
foreign

2126
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,679
all right thank you for the input it

2127
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:30,360
sounds like there is a fair bit of

2128
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,980
support for adopting this as a working

2129
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,719
group item

2130
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,280
um I wouldn't mind hearing from the

2131
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,560
people who have who have not raised

2132
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,239
their hands what their particular

2133
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:41,460
objections are if they're willing to

2134
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,639
share

2135
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,940
but no pressure

2136
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:56,900
foreign

2137
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:00,840
well it sounds overall like there is uh

2138
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,760
interest in taking this on so we'll

2139
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,500
again follow up on the mailing list and

2140
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:07,320
follow up with you any uh offline and at

2141
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,639
a point where there might be Sunshine

2142
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,080
where you are

2143
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,620
um to uh to see about moving this

2144
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:15,239
forward

2145
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:16,739
anything else we should talk about this

2146
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:19,280
topic today

2147
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:24,060
all right thank you very much

2148
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,719
thank you

2149
01:31:27,179 --> 01:31:29,760
all right uh I believe that takes us to

2150
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,500
the end of our scheduled agenda are

2151
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,760
there any other points of business

2152
