all your attention if you could uh if

4
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,380
you could find your table we want to get

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,220
started pretty soon

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,500
hey if if there's someone next to you

7

who doesn't hear if you could uh give

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,640
them a hand and and help clue them in

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,239
that'd be great

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,720
thank you

remotely uh hopefully all of you in the

13
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,640
room can hear me as well

14
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,820
some people in the back if you could

15
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,860
help me with getting others to maybe

16
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,840
take their seat that'd be very helpful

17
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,600
okay thank you I appreciate that

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,320

so welcome to the hackathon it's it's uh

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,460
it's great to have so many people here

21
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,259

22
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,360

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,399

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,920
a table that you like

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,799
um if you haven't yet

27
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,880
um

28
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,860
don't worry about that because there'll

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,619
be time uh after this to kind of get

30
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,140
sorted out into your teams especially

31
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,818
when we have this many people this many

32
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,979
teams this many tables it can be a

33
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,760
little bit of a challenge

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,840
but uh with that let me uh let me get

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,680
going

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,200
um uh first just just one reminder I

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,940
have the uh the pleasure of reminding

38
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,000
everyone that uh at this meeting we we

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,959
are

40
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,720
um required to wear masks except when

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,819
you're speaking uh up at the front like

42
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,060
I am now or obviously we have food and

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,760
and that back there too so uh when

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,379
you're eating drinking

45
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,540
um it's fine to take off your mask but

46
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,940
otherwise please just be uh be mindful

47
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,220
of those around you and

48
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,500
um and help everyone stay safe and

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,140
comfortable and uh but by wearing your

50
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,000
mask and wearing it appropriately I

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,959
would appreciate that

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,200
so I have a few questions I like to ask

53
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,060
at the beginning of each hackathon to

54
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,819
give me and everyone else a sense uh in

55
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,620
the room because I think the hackathon

56
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,720
is a great event for for newcomers to

57
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,660
the ietf and uh this is one one way I

58
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,940
try to validate that um

59
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,099
so for how many of you this is your

60
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,959
first time at an ietf hackathon

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,819
all right that's fantastic to see

62
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,560
so

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,599
you know I'm I'm glad to see that that

64
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,700
Trend continue that this continues to be

65
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,860
a a good event that encourages new

66
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,080
people to come and I hope at the end of

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,180
it that you feel it was a worthwhile use

68
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,000
of your time and and uh really great and

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,319
if you have thoughts about what would

70
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,540
have made it better for you uh let let

71
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,480
me and my co-chairs know because uh you

72
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,659
know we're very excited to have you here

73
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,200
um

74
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,260
now maybe this is somewhat similar but

75
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,299
if this is your first experience with

76
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,299
the ietf at all uh you've never been to

77
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,420
any ietf event before how many of you

78
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,299
are fit into that camp

79
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,040
so not quite as many but still a

80
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,260
significant number and uh

81
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,159
[Applause]

82
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,319
yeah that's also fantastic to see and I

83
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,959
I'm I'm quite biased but I I think that

84
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,700
the the hackathon is a great way to get

85
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,040
started with the ietf and again I I

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,380
think and hope you will too so uh

87
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,820
hopefully the experience is great for

88
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,380
you

89
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,180
um and then you know I had the I almost

90
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,160
took this question down but I think uh

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,020
we're starting to get near what I I hope

92
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,560
is a a better uh way of dealing with

93
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
covid but for how many of you this is

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,580
your first time at an in-person event uh

95
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,560
since covid

96
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,960
so still a fair number of people there

97
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,120
too and and I think uh you know that's

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,400
one of the reasons too why we want to uh

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
make sure we're careful with the mask is

100
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
depending on where you are in the world

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,800
there's different kind of rules and

102
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,320
situations there so uh it's just better

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,780
for everyone if we follow that so thank

104
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,960
you

105
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,000
so I think we're all pretty much aware

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,620
with of this but I still like to go over

107
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,419
it the reason why we're here it's um

108
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,840
it's really to to improve uh our work

109
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,479
around iatf standards and to accelerate

110
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,080
that so uh to kind of be more

111
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,840
collaborative more uh bring more

112
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,940
development into working on the

113
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,919
standards that we've been defining

114
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,440
within ietf and to test things out and

115
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,880
to see if they work or not whether

116
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
they've already been defined or in

117
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,199
existing rfcs or whether it's you know

118
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,180
new ideas that we're thinking about and

119
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,759
we have Internet drafts around

120
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,500
um and it's also a great way I think to

121
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,539
bring a different set of skills and to

122
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,759
invite developers to come in and and

123
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,860
work hand in hand with a lot of the

124
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,300
people who have traditionally been

125
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,780
defining the standards so uh and we want

126
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,220
this to be a good way to to welcome

127
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,440
those people in and and really help you

128
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
get active and contributing to the ietf

129
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
right away in a way that's very valuable

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,900
to the ITF

131
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,600
so as with everything we do in the ITF

132
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,880
the the hackathon does fall under the

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,680
the note well

134
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,460
um

135
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,199
if you haven't familiarized yourself

136
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,479
with this it's kind of hard to read and

137
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,720
very hard to read on this version but um

138
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,940
uh you can download the slides and uh

139
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,100
you can find the uh the note well on the

140
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,520
ietf website too and uh just make sure

141
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,259
you're aware of the rules under which

142
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,080
you're you're participating here

143
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,740
um

144
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,600
now in terms of the rules under which

145
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,060
you're participating the uh the code

146
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,520
that you're working on uh likely has a

147
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,919
license associated with it and so you

148
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,960
should be familiar with that too because

149
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,000
the code you're working on is not

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,479
necessarily iatf uh property it's

151
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,400
probably uh there's probably a license

152
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
associated with it and that governs the

153
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,539
rules around the code you're using and

154
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,460
how you you use it distribute it

155
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,680
contribute to it so so make sure you

156
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,280
look at that

157
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,919
now we have a whole lot of projects last

158
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,280
I saw we were well over 30 projects I I

159
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,780
didn't count today

160
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,580
but uh but they're all on the hackathon

161
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,259
wiki hopefully you found the hackathon

162
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,960
wiki that's kind of your source of a

163
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,180
truth for this whole event that's where

164
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,160
things get updated

165
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,960
um so if there's new projects new

166
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,180
information that the agenda changes in

167
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,940
any way uh we'll update it on the uh the

168
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,800
hackathon wiki first and then

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,360
information kind of propagates from

170
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,520
there so so take a look at those

171
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,099
projects hopefully one or more of them

172
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,780
resonates with you if you haven't found

173
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,199
a project uh yet and you need some help

174
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,080

center and help get you situated

179
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,039
we also have a web page that that is uh

180
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,199
called Lost and Found and that's that's

181
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,840
really to serve two purposes one is if

182
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,360
you're a participant uh looking for a

183
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,180
project it's a way that you can kind of

184
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,520
share oh hey I'm looking for a team here

185
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,139
are some things I'm interested in or

186
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,000
some some of the skills I can bring to

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,819
the the team likewise if you're if

188
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,460
you're leading a project and you're

189
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,560
looking for a particular skill set or

190
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,720
people you can advertise there that

191
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,699
that's what you need and so that's

192
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,860
another way to try to match up people

193
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,919
with uh with teams so you can take a

194
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,360
look at that too there's a link to that

195
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,240
on the wiki

196
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,240
foreign

197
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,200
for that

198
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,140
the rest of the day we won't be using uh

199
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,059
miteko here in the room we'll be using

200
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,799
gather and you might want to use gather

201
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,519
to uh to meet up with uh people who are

202
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,260
participating remotely we do have a

203
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,200
number of people doing that

204
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,040
um

205
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,320
lunch will be provided kind of in that

206
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,480
same area so you don't you don't need to

207
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,580
to leave and go out for lunch of course

208
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,800
you still can if you want but we try to

209
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,420
make it easy for you to stay here and

210
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,760
continue to to work on your project so

211
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,440
lunch will be brought in we'll have some

212
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,839
snacks in the afternoon uh we'll even

213
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,480
have dinner and it's a pretty nice

214
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,940
dinner from what I hear so

215
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,680
um uh hopefully you can stay for that

216
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,240
it'd be great if you can stay with us

217
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,740
the whole evening

218
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,339
the doors will close at nine o'clock and

219
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,860
so at nine o'clock we really do ask that

220
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,620
that you you leave and that allows the

221
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,779
hotel staff to come in clean things up

222
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,120
and shut everything down and and lets

223
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,500
them get it home you know at a

224
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,240
reasonable time as well

225
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,399
so uh if you want to continue working on

226
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,620
your projects after nine o'clock that's

227
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,440
perfectly fine just just don't do it in

228
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,899
this room right uh the Network's up

229
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,940
everywhere except when the power goes

230
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,519
out and uh and so you should be able to

231
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,560
work on it wherever you want and that's

232
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,540
fine so there's no rules around when you

233
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,399
can and can't work on your project it's

234
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,940
just the room closes at 9 00 pm

235
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,740
it'll then open up again tomorrow

236
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,279
morning as it did today certainly by by

237
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,140
9 30 in the morning everything will be

238
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,120
open and there'll be some snacks back

239
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,700
there again and then lunch will be

240
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,980
provided again and then a really

241
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,540
important thing especially for those of

242
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,040
you who are new and you may not have

243
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,980
seen this agenda before is we have these

244
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,279
uh sharing of results of your project

245
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,660
and this is voluntary you don't have to

246
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,820
do it but it's a really good way to give

247
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,760
a short summary of what you did what

248
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,060
your team did what you accomplished

249
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,160
um and what you learned and and what

250
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,140
you're going to bring back into say an

251
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,540
ietf working group based on how your

252
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,820
project went we like to hear about those

253
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,959
types of things so this is an

254
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,579
opportunity for you to share with

255
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,920
everyone just just a very uh brief

256
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,140
presentation and so those happen

257
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,940
starting at two o'clock

258
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,339
and run till about four o'clock or

259
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:54,839
however long it takes us to get through

260
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,959
all of them uh so if you plan on doing

261
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,420
that which I suggest you do that means

262
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,399
you need to plan on wrapping up your

263
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,700
project and start working on your few

264
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,040
slides your summary give yourself enough

265
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,959
time to do that so that you you have

266
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,560
that ready and you can upload it uh to

267
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,380
uh to GitHub before we we do the

268
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,940
presentations and I have some slides

269
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,480
that show you uh more details about that

270
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,640
and then the hackathon ends at four

271
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,500
o'clock and then

272
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,540
um you know we ask that everyone collect

273
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,160
your stuff and make sure you're out of

274
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,040
here by five so that the the room can be

275
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,100
set again for the next uh the rest of

276
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,220
the uh ietf week

277
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,779
any questions on the agenda

278
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,640
yeah uh there is a mic up here if you

279
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,019
don't mind coming up to it that way

280
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,660
remote uh participants can hear it too

281
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,300
oh yes is there a a hackers lounge or

282
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,940
the code Lounge it'll actually be here

283
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,920
um and I have a slide about that too but

284
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,620
yeah yeah there will be that so you do

285
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,420
have the ability after the hackathon

286
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,860
that's a really good point you can

287
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,140
continue to work on your projects really

288
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,700
all week

289
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,260
um and I think that that's a great idea

290
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,000
we just kind of have this Focus thing

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,040
the weekend before but you know there's

292
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,399
no reason you need to stop uh uh coding

293
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,500
thing so I encourage you to do that all

294
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,680
week

295
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,380
I mentioned gather before uh we started

296
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,680
using gather when we had the online only

297
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,140
hackathon uh yeah online only hackathon

298
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,899
in the online only iitf meetings and we

299
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,339
continue to have it as a great tool

300
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,740
especially if you have some people who

301
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,200
are um remote who are joining your

302
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,560
project you're welcome to to use gather

303
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,680
what is shown here is kind of what the

304
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,600
screen is when you first come in to

305
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,940
gather and you'll see that

306
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,820
on the the right hand side there's

307
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,740
arrows pointing to get to the hackathon

308
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,779
space there's a separate space within

309
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,639
hack within gathered just for the

310
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,760
hackathon so if you follow those arrows

311
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,800
to the right

312
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,040
you'll enter into this space which is

313
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,720
separate just for the hackathon and

314
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,880
you'll see there's some tables there not

315
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,639
as many as there are in here but uh but

316
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,800
those of you who want can kind of pick a

317
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,240
table

318
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,220
um let your team know that that you're

319
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,440
meeting at that table and you you can

320
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,740
use that for the the duration of the um

321
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,339
uh the hackathon in the event we run out

322
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,380
of tables uh I'm pretty sure we can

323
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,180
create some more within the the virtual

324
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,339
space that that hasn't been an issue in

325
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,860
the past so just kind of pick your table

326
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,100
and uh uh usually by sitting your

327
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,320
virtual self at the table is is a really

328
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,600
good way to uh to kind of pick it for

329
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,959
your team

330
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,660
so hacknet uh this is a an optional

331
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,519
thing that's available if some of you

332
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,700
who are working on uh you know uh

333
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,700
internet protocols you may need special

334
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,060
kind of network setups and with hacknet

335
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,760
we have the ability to accommodate uh

336
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,380
some of those so if you have special

337
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,800
networking needs Beyond using the uh the

338
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,399
ietf a wireless network if you need

339
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,620
wired connections there's some tables

340
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,800
here that that have uh the ability for

341
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,360
you to plug in and just have a wired

342
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,339
connection into the iatf network but if

343
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,980
you need a separate network with

344
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,720
um some special things on it where maybe

345
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,560
uh uh some prefix delegation or you know

346
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,500
whatever you need for your uh your

347
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,380
protocol whatever you're working on you

348
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,940
can let us know you can request it and

349
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,620
we'll try to accommodate that the knock

350
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,600
works with us to try to accommodate what

351
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,899
you need

352
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,639
uh you'll find a link to that on the

353
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,459
wiki as well and uh how to access it and

354
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,859
how to request the special capabilities

355
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,420
the results presentation I mentioned

356
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,160
that briefly before this just gives you

357
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,040
a little bit more detail about it based

358
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,380
on the number of teams I see here I I'm

359
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,480
guessing that we'll have to limit the

360
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,699
presentations to about four minutes each

361
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,339
so these are very short presentations

362
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,100
just to give people a uh you know the

363
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,019
highlights of of what your project was

364
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,839
about and what you accomplished and

365
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,180
um and kind of there think of them as

366
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,399
conversation starters so that people can

367
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,380
come up and and have a more in-depth

368
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,420
conversation at you at one of the other

369
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,579
kind of opportunities that we provide

370
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,560
for that and I'll talk about those in

371
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,399
just a second as well

372
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:43,079
so if you are planning on sharing your

373
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,240
results uh giving one of these

374
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,760
presentations the way that we do it is

375
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,040
we use uh we have an ietf hackathon

376
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,519
GitHub organization and within that

377
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,880
organization we have a repo that we

378
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,220
created for this particular hackathon

379
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,980
and it's pretty simply innate label

380
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,240
although you may not be able to read it

381
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,010
very well iatf 115

382
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,600
[Music]

383
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,260
um

384
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,180
uh

385
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,180
uh project presentations and so what

386
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,779
you'll do is you'll upload your

387
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:16,440
um

388
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,160
your presentation into that repo in

389
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,740
order to do that and there's a link to

390
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,959
that the project presentations there in

391
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,240
order to upload though you need to

392
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,240
actually become a a member of the iitf

393
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,880
hackathon organization and the way you

394
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,600
do that is by sending a request to uh

395
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,240
the hackathon chairs and we will add you

396
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,579
to that and you can find our email

397
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:44,699
address there's an alias there on the uh

398
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,100
the on the Wiki page on the hackathon

399
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,860
Wiki page so when you request that we'll

400
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,720
add you and then you'll be able to

401
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,880
upload your presentation there because

402
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,339
when we do the project presentations at

403
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,139
two o'clock tomorrow what we basically

404
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,639
do is we run through all the

405
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,519
presentations that have been uploaded so

406
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,380
it's important that you have your um

407
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,599
your presentation uploaded when we start

408
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,899
that

409
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,520
and the readme gives you some

410
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,919
instructions about how to get added to

411
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,400
the the group how to contact us and how

412
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,380
it all works

413
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,059
there's also

414
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,640
a couple more things in there that I

415
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,260
think I didn't I forgot to point out

416
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,860
that when you go to that repo you'll see

417
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,679
um some templates and you're welcome to

418
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,480
use those for your project presentations

419
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,000
there's a PowerPoint template there's

420
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,760
also an HTML template you can use either

421
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
one of those and there's some uh uh

422
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,559
directions and links there so that you

423
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,960
can download those and use those and

424
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,940
that just helps make it a little

425
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,460
actually I yeah I think we I think they

426
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,140
should be uploaded I think they should

427
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,240
be I'll need to check I think they

428
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,660
should be updated for IHF 115 as opposed

429
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,059
to itf-114

430
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,280
um I'll I'll check that after uh after

431
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,000
we get through this

432
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,140
then related implementations this is a

433
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,240
relatively new feature in the data

434
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,600
tracker and the idea behind it is uh we

435
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,860
mentioned that a lot of the stuff we're

436
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,480
coding up here right it's closely

437
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,559
related to iatf rfcs and drafts but it's

438
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,320
not always easy for people to find code

439
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,200
that is related to ietf rfcs and drafts

440
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,960
so this related implementations is a way

441
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,960
that you can create that linkage so then

442
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,120
on the data tracker when people go to

443
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,039
your IHF draft that you're working on

444
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,140
you have an implementation that's

445
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,340
associated with it either you're

446
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,140
implementing the draft or some tools

447
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,480
that help with implementing or testing

448
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,940
or sniffing traffic on the network

449
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,460
related to that draft so you can create

450
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,919
that linkage here and so when you go to

451
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,539
the data tracker you'll see something

452
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,299
called additional resources and if you

453
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,700
click on that

454
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,760
you can then enter information about

455
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,320
related

456
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,400
implementations there's a related

457
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,799
implementations tag egg and you can put

458
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,520
that and then include the

459
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,059
um

460
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,520
like your the link to your GitHub repo

461
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,980
or wherever the code happens to be

462
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,960
if it's an individual draft you'll have

463
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,820
the ability to do this yourself if it's

464
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,220
a working group draft I believe you

465
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,620
still need to work with your working

466
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,900
group chair to make that happen but the

467
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,580
working group chairs are familiar with

468
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,080
this and they should be able to help you

469
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,260
out so I really encourage you to do this

470
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,440
because we work on a lot of code in the

471
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,320
hackathon and then oftentimes you know

472
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,120
it kind of gets forgotten or people

473
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,799
don't realize that there's this code

474
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,539
associated with the draft or with the

475
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,940
RFC and this is a way that you can help

476
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,400
others who aren't you know here in the

477
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,900
hackathon aren't working with the code

478
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,299
on you uh aren't working on the code

479
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,539
with you to help them find it and uh and

480
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,280
then maybe they'll use it maybe they'll

481
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,919
contribute to it but anyways it gets it

482
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,660
out there and helps people discover it

483
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,419
so I really appreciate it if you could

484
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,640
if you could do that many of you have

485
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,400
indicated on the wiki the hackathon wiki

486
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,620
the drafts that you're you're working on

487
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,080
or that your code is associated with and

488
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
if you could go and also create that

489
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,860
linkage that'd be great if you have any

490
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,620
problems doing it I'm happy to help you

491
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,620
can come see me up here and uh and we'll

492
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,639
help get that sorted out

493
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,299
any questions about that

494
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,360
okay

495
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,960
so I mentioned that there's other

496
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
opportunities to have more extended

497
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,340
conversations around your project and

498
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,340
one great one is hack demo happy hour

499
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,940
so on Monday uh when is it it's from six

500
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,320
to seven

501
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,120
I believe it's yeah it's in this same

502
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
room and we'll have some space set up

503
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,179
here with tables and you have the whole

504
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,400
hour then to

505
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,559
um kind of demo your project to

506
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,539
whoever's interested and that could

507
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:04,860
include people who are here at the

508
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,140
hackathon that see your presentation it

509
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,700
could be people that are here for the

510
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,440
iatf meeting and weren't here at the

511
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,660
hackathon at all and now that they're

512
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,179
interested in what you did so this gives

513
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:16,559
you the opportunity to have those more

514
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,900
in-depth conversations that that can't

515
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,059
happen on a Sunday when we do the

516
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,240
results presentation so I encourage you

517
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,160
to do that if you if you're interested

518
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,280
in doing it you need to register because

519
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,140
that's how we know how many tables we

520
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,120
have to get set up and and all that and

521
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,159
that make sure we have enough space and

522
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,320
so make sure you do that by noon on

523
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,140
Monday and uh if so then then we'll make

524
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,820
sure we have space to accommodate you

525
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,220
the code Lounge uh as was asked about

526
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,740
that'll be here and that'll continue all

527
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,140
week we may not have this whole room but

528
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,760
we'll at least have a good amount of

529
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,000
space where you can come and uh and

530
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,740
you're welcome to to work on your code

531
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,679
and if it's helpful you can schedule

532
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,840
time and there's a page you'll find

533
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,460
where you can put on there and some

534
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,280
people have already done it the l4s team

535
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,500
has done that and they can indicate when

536
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,419
they plan to be here and that's just to

537
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,980
help others who might be interested in

538
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,440
working on your project know uh when

539
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,679
you're going to be here so it's uh you

540
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,659
don't have to register but I think it

541
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,520
can be a handy thing and there's no

542
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,500
problem with multiple teams registering

543
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,240
at the same time that's actually a good

544
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,620
thing because it we get a bit of

545
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,020
critical mass here uh working on running

546
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,700
code so that's great to see too

547
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,220
then I also want to make sure that I

548
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,960
thank our sponsors we actually have two

549
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,840
sponsors this time we have meta who's a

550
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,539
running code sponsor at Silver level and

551
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,059
then we have icann as a bronze level

552
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,120
sponsor and that's fantastic because uh

553
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,440
I mentioned we should have a nicer

554
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,260
dinner those things cost money and so

555
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,659
it's really nice to get the sponsorship

556
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,240

564
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,159

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,640

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,500
here

587
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,100
[Applause]

588
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,539
for people trying to collaborate

589
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,360
off-site is there a VPN or something to

590
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,760
get into this room

591
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,380
um

592
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,900
so

593
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,400
[Music]

594
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,740
I thought oh I guess through through

595
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,720
hacknet

596
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,880
you can

597
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,960
um

598
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,880
they can get onto the iatf network

599
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,299
remotely through hacknet uh now the only

600
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,919
problem with that is if they don't have

601
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,500
a device already like a micro tick

602
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,020
they they might have some problems but

603
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,179
uh that's the way for them to do it

604
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:21,500
any other questions

605
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,240
okay well thanks again for your

606
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,179
