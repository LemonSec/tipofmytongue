1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,680
you're presenting this can be done but

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,360
we will need

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,700
someone to help us taking notes before

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,599
we get started

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,800
so let me repeat right we cannot start

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
the meeting without an official minute

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,140
taker you don't need to take minutes of

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,540
the slides they are recorded but it's

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,120
more about taking the questions the name

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,340
of the guy asking the questions and the

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,120
answer a summary is enough

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,180
anyone can help us thank you Reggie

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,399
thank you

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,379

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,820
okay so with that

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,500
um I think we are one minute pass so

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,780
let's get started welcome everyone to

19

more information about any of these

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,800
topics you have a list of BCPS that can

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,459
be of use

47
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,959
thank you

48
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,000
so

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,780
please uh you have a QR code for you to

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,819
to log in your presence to the meeting

51
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,739
instead of the blue sheets

52
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,300
so make sure that you sign into the

53
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,640
session using this mythical

54
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,540
uh from the data tracker and use please

55
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,220
the meter code to join the queue that's

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,560
what we will use here as chairs to to

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,019
handle the the discussion

58
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,599
uh please keep your audio and video off

59
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,379
if you are using the outside and wear

60
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,660
masks unless actively speaking at the

61
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,040
microphone

62
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,560
so for the remote participants make sure

unless you are talking

65
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,980
and well a headset is

66
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,980
I think useful at this time

67
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,640
uh we have a link to the agenda uh me to

68

go and other information and if you have

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,180
any technical

assistance needs uh please uh go to that

71
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,400
page

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,800
so one last reminder minutes are taking

and uh I'm going to continue with a

93
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,639
presentation about some IEEE initiatives

94
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,699
related to Don's draft

95
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,320
um then we're gonna have Bob presenting

96
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,259
the Internet Protocol number for chic

97
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,419
then IP Parcels from Fred and on E BPF

98
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,699
update from dates that were are there

99
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,100
any questions or discussion on the

100
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,520
agenda

101
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,400
okay so here none

102
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,080
if you want to give the updates

103
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,500
a quick update on draft template parcel

104
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,220
so as you know we started a

105
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,639
call for adoption after the previous

106
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,220
ietf we extended by a few weeks too and

107
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,199
there was at the end it was decided that

108
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,660
there are no no supports from the

109
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,100
community so the draft wasn't adopted

110
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,759
thank you

111
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,699
thank you very much

112
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,000
so with that I guess we are ready to

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,039
move to the next item which will be

114
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,639
don't

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,800
um

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
would you like me to share the slides

117
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,020
yeah

118
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm not sure it works

119
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,120
um no hi I'm Donald Eastlake with future

120
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,880
wave this is just a few slides to give a

121
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,840
quick update on RFC 7042 bits which I

122
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,940
hope people will take a moment to look

123
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,740
at and comment if they find anything

124
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,940
worthy of comment next slide

125
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,460
so it's basically a part of a

126
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,979
series of BCP rfcs each one oscillating

127
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,020
the previous that have covered the

128
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,680
allocation of parameters under the Iana

129
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,259
oui basically Mac addresses and things

130
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,539
of that sort

131
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,360
um and it also touches on the allocation

132
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,600
of other uh typically 802 code points

133
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,060
that are from blocks that IEEE has

134
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,639
allocated to Iana

135
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,800
and mentions a few other related pieces

136
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,900
of information so much more thorough

137
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,600
presentation was given at the last ietf

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,520
and you can go look at the slides at

139
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,860
that URL if you want to see those and it

140
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,300
has been adopted by the working group

141
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,199
Next slide

142
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,900
so uh I think it's in good shape for a

143
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,340
working group last call

144
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,620
uh there is uh however a couple

145
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,620
questions related to the Iana web pages

146
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,419
and the provisions there there's

147
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,699
currently two Iana web pages one of

148
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,160
which is called ethernet numbers

149
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,039
for numbers assigned under the Yana oui

150
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
and the other is called IEEE 802 numbers

151
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,539
so the ethernet number is one because

152
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,080
Iana controls them uh is it really

153
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,460
authoritative

154
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,780
and uh the IEEE 802 numbers page is

155
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,660
really an informational page which has

156
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,220
stuff that's under the control of the

157
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,800
IEEE registration Authority

158
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,639
so this draft also renames the ethernet

159
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,280
numbers page to be the Yana ethernet

160
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,039
number page to be more consistent to

161
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,780
make it clearer the distinction between

162
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,280
the two

163
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,620
uh there was a I guess I probably should

164
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,419
have put the RFC number on here there

165
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,319
was a registry created for uh

166
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,599
Ayanna link local Discovery protocol Tov

167
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,419
subtypes and uh one that was created it

168
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,319
was stuck on the IEEE 802 page when it

169
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,180
really shouldn't have been because it's

170
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,340
not allocated by the IEEE registration

171
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,979
Authority it's allocated under the Yana

172
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,780
oui that should have been on the Anna

173
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,680
page so this RFC 7042 biss moves it

174
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,660
there

175
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,860
um

176
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,240
and I've checked with the authors of the

177
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
RFC and the uh and so on and so forth so

178
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,800
if everybody's okay with that move next

179
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,099
slide

180
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,799
uh this is I think the last slide uh the

181
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,159
substance so uh most of the activity on

182
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,320
the IEEE 802 numbers page that's the

183
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,820
informational one

184
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,279
uh is relates to Ether types basically

185
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,380
uh Andreas read the types there are

186
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,640
updated or added to uh when directed by

187
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,399
the experts for the registry and it's

188
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,200
easier to access information there and

189
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,140
to update it than it is through the IEEE

190
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,760
authoritative listing

191
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,880
also in that page is a short list of LLC

192
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,880
sap numbers which is hasn't changed much

193
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,740
and the third thing which will would

194
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,500
still be there after this draft uh if

195
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,620
its draft issues is a list of OU of

196
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,200
early oui assignments that's not really

197
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,060
something most people find interesting I

198
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,260
guess it used to be useful that you

199
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,120
could figure out who had manufactured a

200
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,920
NIC card or something by looking at the

201
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,420
MAC address and looking up there that's

202
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,760
that's still true but that is not really

203
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
getting updated so

204
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,300
if people have an opinion as to whether

205
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,820
or not that part of an oui assignments

206
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,680
should still be retained on this

207
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,899
informational Yana web page I'd be

208
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,600
interested in that so uh

209
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,240
there is some conversation between the

210
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,540
ETF and the IEEE about ether types and I

211
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,519
guess uh Juan Carlos is going to talk a

212
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,060
bit about that

213
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,940
thanks Don so uh I'm going to present

214
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,580
next and then we'll take q a because uh

215
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,019
the next presentation is related

216
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,080
so hi um

217
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,560
here in interior and this is uh to give

218
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,420
you an update about certain discussions

219
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,060
we've been having between IEEE and ITF

220
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,660
uh regarding uh this uh Registries and

221
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,899
how we can make better use of them

222
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,399
please thanks

223
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,580
foreign

224
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,200
so to give you a background uh don't

225
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,720
just give an update about draft ietf

226
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,300
interior RFC

227
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,279
7402 bits which is trying to update that

228
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,000
document that is outdated and

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,060
indeed we can provide better information

230
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,440
that's a summary much of the Clause 2

231
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,959
covers the IEEE Mac addresses and

232
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,640
address policies as stated on the I

233
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,339
truly side much of classes three and

234
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,360
four covers the III protocol identifiers

235
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,000
including ether type and policies

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,300
now on the IEEE side

237
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,660
there are standards uh policies and

238
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,820
registration of these parameters that

239
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,700
are handled by that triple E and uh

240
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,860
there are multiple of these instances

241
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,779
but uh here there are three examples

242
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,420
that uh will give you an idea of what

243
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,579
we're talking about so first we have the

244
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,740
IEEE standards Association registration

245
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,160
Authority uh committee or Iraq that is

246
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,600
responsible for the assignment of

247
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,899
numbers such as ether types and ouis so

248
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:50,160
this uh Mac addresses as we commonly use

249
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,060
him but uniquely assigned

250
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,579
then uh the IEEE sa registration

251
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,100
Authority publishes policies regarding

252
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,260
the use of these parameters such as

253
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,200
ether types and Mac addresses and we

254
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,880
also have a standards like highee 802

255
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,720
overall like the umbrella of 802 11 15 3

256
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,180
and all that that is in this case

257
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,420
managed by the IEEE or 2.1 working group

258
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,519
which specifies policies regarding the

259
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,980
use of these parameters like ether types

260
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,920
and Mac addresses uh now what happens is

261
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,500
that there are current developments to

262
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,420
amend for instance the use of these

263
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,060
parameters in this case uh 802f the

264
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,240
young model for ether types and in in

265
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,579
fact IEEE standard saver2 as a whole is

266
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,220
currently uh on the rearration so next

267
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,700
slide please

268
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,519
so uh we can anticipate the following uh

269
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,040
because the draft here references and

270
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,500
talks about the description of these uh

271
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,959
living moving Targets in on the IEEE

272
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,480
side we can anticipate that the IEEE

273
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,820
registration Authority should review the

274
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,200
the draft to ensure that there's

275
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,639
alignment with respect to the

276
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
registration of this policies and

277
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,519
assignments

278
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,760
and also 82.1 working group uh working

279
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,500
on this specification should review the

280
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,880
draft to ensure that there's alignment

281
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,519
with respect to what they are planning

282
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,040
to do on this revisions

283
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,160
so uh what the discussions we are having

284
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,600
on the background we think that we

285
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,700
should encourage them to review and

286
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,220
provide some answers before we publish

287
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,440
to ensure there's consistency with this

288
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,660
IEEE communication first point

289
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,579
of course we should take into account

290
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,360
their views and even as a stretch goal

291
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,860
there are some efforts to harmonize the

292
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,560
Registries because as Donald explained

293
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,600
there are uh the Registries on the

294
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,700
Israel police are very specific to let's

295
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,380
say legal terms when someone acquires

296
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,420
one of these numbers and assignments so

297
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,860
it will

298
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,860
mention who is the assignee of a number

299
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,279
that requested it but here in the Ayana

300
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,500
side we have extra information that is

301
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,300
super useful for implementers like what

302
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,000
is this number being used for uh PPP

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,639
ether type it is that information is

304
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,680
missing on left hand side they are the

305
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,480
owners we have useful information on the

306
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,519
right hand side and we need to somehow

307
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,860
keep track of each other and I've heard

308
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,220
at least more than uh well a few uh

309
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,899
people complaining and which one is the

310
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,399
one the official one which one should I

311
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,800
refer to so I think it's this is a good

312
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,320
opportunity the fact that uh on the one

313
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,660
hand we have Donald's draft uh

314
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,040
explaining to

315
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,320
ETF people what these are and how they

316
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,139
should be used on the other hand we have

317
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,600
common discussion or constant

318
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,360
discussions with IEEE about how they are

319
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,519
going to evolve these specifications and

320
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,260
why not I would say take advantage of

321
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,260
the fact that this uh thing happening to

322
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,180
proper will probably harmonize the

323
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,279
registry so that we have one single

324
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,480
registry

325
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,600
most likely IEEE stating for instance

326
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,480
the usage of these protocols also from

327
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,220
the insi

328
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,579
and I think that is my last life

329
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,680
so I don't know if there are any

330
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,720
questions

331
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,220
regarding the status basically what I'm

332
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,160
saying here is that uh Donald's draft

333
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,740
right now should be from the if the IDF

334
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,540
site pretty much ready for publication

335
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,399
but because there's all these things

336
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,680
happening outside we think it's worth

337
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,100
holding on a bit uh before calling uh

338
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,420
for publication

339
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,300
so that we hear from the IEEE side their

340
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,660
views

341
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,199
yeah it's not least like from future way

342
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,680
again I just want to mention there is a

343
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,019
joint iet5ee leadership mailing list

344
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,380
that uh notice about this draft has been

345
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,360
posted and though this was posted again

346
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,100
when it was adopted by the Indiana area

347
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,019
working group and so forth

348
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,480
and uh along with the request that

349
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,019
people in IEEE look at it and no

350
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,000
comments have been received so far so

351
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,860
I'm not quite sure exactly what the path

352
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,720
forward is I mean are you sure they

353
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,980
should look at it and comment some that

354
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,820
would be useful but uh

355
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,779
are we going to do a little formal

356
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,940
liaison I mean there's a lot of common

357
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,800
members that already seems necessary I

358
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,639
don't know

359
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,139
uh

360
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,459
I would

361
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,620
maybe let uh I don't know Paul do you

362
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,260
want to take that uh thanks Suresh your

363
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,500
restaurant

364
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,100
yeah

365
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,680
hi uh yeah this is Paul Congdon to lock

366
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,620
networks I'm also a task group chair in

367
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,180
802.1 and as you mentioned as as we are

368
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,560
meeting next week

369
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,300
um and my task group has specifically

370
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,139
been chartered to do a review of the

371
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,680
70 70 42 bits um we'll be providing a

372
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,180
response

373
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,279
um the whole point of the IEEE 802

374
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,500
coordination thing is to often avoid

375
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,240
those official Liaisons if we don't need

376
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,000
to but uh it you know sometimes it's

377
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,500
still very important to have them just

378
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,180
from raising the awareness and whatnot

379
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,339
so it's likely uh that we'll be

380
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,559
chartered with um or I'll be chartered

381
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,540
with Drafting and a liaison that

382
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,699
indicates we're doing this review We

383
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,140
would like you guys to wait a little

384
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,699
longer for your last call until we've

385
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,319
done that but understand the urgency so

386
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,939
and thank you for the excellent answer

387
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,140
to my question as to what the fast

388
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,339
forward is yeah

389
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,820
so this comment is for like uh don so um

390
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,140
so one of the things that happened

391
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,900
probably five six years ago on the iesg

392
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,179
is like we needed a ether type

393
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,780
and the like uh 7042 didn't have

394
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,480
anything I I looked at the biz draft

395
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,700
quickly as well and I think like some

396
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,320
kind of guidance on like how to get I

397
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,580
know like it's not like we don't have a

398
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,799
special path to do it but if you can add

399
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,360
in some text I can probably give you

400
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,220
input about like what to add how I did

401
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,740
it as the ad but it'll be good if you

402
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,240
can actually throw in an appendix saying

403
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,980
hey this is how you go about from the I

404
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,660
because it says like IES approval is

405
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,640
needed but like nobody knows what

406
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,500
happens after for the shepherding area

407
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,880
so Eric is probably going to be in this

408
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,799
position soon he's going to need an e to

409
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,539
die but he doesn't know what to do right

410
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,120
and um

411
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,660
um

412
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,160
I don't know if you want to speak about

413
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,140
that okay

414
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,360
this is Donnelly's like again uh yeah so

415
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,700
there's an isg statement which is

416
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,500
up in the IHG statements is also

417
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,760
included in the draft I don't know if

418
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,500
it's good or bad that it's in two places

419
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,380
uh and basically it says that uh you

420
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,140
need to get iesg clearance before you do

421
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,840
that uh previously any working group

422
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,840
chair or No Good Reason whatever could

423
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,700
go through the obvious paperwork you

424
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,160
just go to the Triple A registration uh

425
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,220
Authority site ask for an ether type and

426
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,360
uh

427
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,919
you know basically you say it's for

428
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,440
standards use and you you check the I'll

429
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,240
pay the fee by wire it's like twenty

430
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,740
five hundred dollars but in fact because

431
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,480
the standards use they never bill you

432
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
and it all goes through for free it's

433
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,020
very simple it used to be that way so

434
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,760
last time this happened there was this

435
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,679
funny stuff where somehow

436
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,740
I mean I I we should say what we how we

437
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,539
want it to happen but there was a I

438
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,220
think a belief on some pardon the iesg

439
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,620
people that Ianna itself should apply

440
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,780
for it or something and it was just it

441
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,600
was confused I my thought was that once

442
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,340
the isg has approved this then uh this

443
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,780
you the working group chair can still

444
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,539
apply for it right I mean since I'm the

445
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,460
the primary expert on these Registries I

446
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,960
could do it for for people it doesn't

447
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,240
happen very often maybe once or twice a

448
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,799
year at most I mean something like that

449
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:32,940
so

450
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,039
yeah six years ago was the last time it

451
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,020
happened so okay so it's not like it's

452
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,059
but maybe that's the problem if it

453
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,740
happened more often people would learn

454
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,640
how to do it so yeah excellent idea to

455
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,679
include more specific instructions on

456
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,000
how to do this

457
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,679
yeah thank you so I think like uh so

458
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,720
Suresh again sorry to like get back uh

459
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,340
Rob and I had a few but I think that was

460
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,679
a fine so like I found this page by

461
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,720
Google search to go where to apply for

462
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,160
the stita type even though I already got

463
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,380
the ASG approval right so I said hey go

464
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,760
to this page and and don't do the

465
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,080
payment that kind of thing so it said

466
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,940
like it was 1500 back then I think but

467
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,679
like yeah same thing right you just

468
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,120
didn't know what to do so I think some

469
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,620
informational appendix it says like hey

470
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,780
this is the current procedure at the

471
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,160
time this draft is written it might

472
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,419
change but this is just a general thing

473
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,340
you won't get charged for it and after

474
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,660
that is your approach you can go ahead

475
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,000
and do it

476
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,640
uh so Rob Wilson Cisco um trying not to

477
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,460
step on exercise and my suggestion is as

478
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,559
well as the A's and Alias uh we have a

479
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,000
meeting with them once I really think

480
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
it's four months it's like once before

481
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,260
each meeting if you were to email

482
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,660
um Russ and Dorothy and ask them just to

483
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,860
track this as an issue

484
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,380
it's already tracked is it okay oh fine

485
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,280
okay

486
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,160
okay so it's very tracked okay

487
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,500
yeah I think so indeed it's it's uh it's

488
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,080
tracked and and also Donald mentioned

489
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,360
but I just want to stress so so there's

490
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,900
a 2X expert uh been uh referenced in the

491
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,780
Ayana pages and it's Donald and me so if

492
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,600
you want to to ask questions and we

493
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,880
should be able to help but uh more than

494
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,919
that the idea is to make it easier in

495
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,480
the future and you don't have to ask

496
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,100
questions the information should be

497
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,160
available and also more coherent

498
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,600
all right

499
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,820
so with that

500
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,340
[Music]

501
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,340
um

502
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,100
our next speaker is

503
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,500
oh

504
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,240
next is Bob

505
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,880
many of these slides are pretty much

506
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,000
what I had my last presentation back in

507
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,380
July with some slight modification

508
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,520
um so this is requesting that for the lp

509
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,020
Wan

510
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,220
um State um stateful context header

511
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,260
compressions chic

512
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,380
to be having a a protocol number

513
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,159
assigned so we can do Chic at the VIP

514
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,620
level instead of having to do it higher

515
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,980
next slide please

516
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,520
so

517
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,559
um why and this is reviewed the slide I

518
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,500
had last time networks are complex and

519
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,600
what if the constrained link is within

520
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,020
the link in in the path that the uh um

521
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,000
that is the endpoints node of the

522
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,780
constraint but have no control over it

523
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,880
um all IV contact is within a

524
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,080
non-compress or all of economies in a

525
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,760
non-compressed security wrapper example

526
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,320
dot ESP or dtls so we have these cases

527
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,020
we're looking at and particularly in in

528
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,380
my area in aviation that it may be

529
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,080
avionic system inside the plane

530
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,600
which has no understanding this it knows

531
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,580
there's a constrained link there but has

532
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,440
no control over it it just has an

533
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,059
Ethernet connection to the planes

534
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,280
Network and going out from there so how

535
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,520
can the the the application inside that

536
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,919
avionic system talking to some Ground

537
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,679
Control Systems somewhere again on an

538
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,799
Ethernet Network be able to compress so

539
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,799
doing this at at the IP network layer

540
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,600
instead of what Sheikh has been doing

541
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,240
others would be highly effective in

542
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,940
consuming a very scarce resource of that

543
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,460
RF link um to the aircraft next slide

544
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,200
please

545
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,440
so if if the IPv6 next header were Chic

546
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,720
the rules can be compressed for

547
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,400
transporting on up to the security

548
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,640
envelope so like in many cases UDP will

549
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,440
compress to zero bytes

550
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,659
because everything you need for UDP is

551
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,960
really in TC in dtls and um if you only

552
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,059
have the one application running what do

553
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,380
you UDP for

554
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,159
um so um and and so that helps

555
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,140
um and you can even indicate what rules

556
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,419
for within the security envelope so you

557
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,059
may say able to say like for what's in

558
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,200
the envelope here's I'm going to

559
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,780
compress that so we get a significant

560
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,879
gain by doing this next slide

561
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,280
um we can effectively it effectively

562
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,280
comes a transport when Chic becomes the

563
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,020
next header that effectively becomes

564
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,419
transport that then processes whatever

565
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,340
transport is within it

566
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,080
um and still transport the original

567
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,659
transport layer compressed example have

568
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:41,280
UDP CRC when ESP and dtls has better

569
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,179
they have Macs so why with the CRC and

570
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,100
provide new valuable transport functions

571
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,380
so one of the things we're discussing

572
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,440
right now in the chart retirement lpwan

573
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,980
is to include FEC directly as a Chic

574
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,580
option so we can be doing um the Forward

575
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,460
Air correction and again making more

576
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,000
effective use of our of our scarce on

577
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,520
wireless service or raise take a low

578
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,260
reliable

579
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,240
um spectrum and make it highly reliable

580
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,240
by uh by including FEC so we can then

581
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,860
have that at this point next slide

582
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,080
and just a quick review about uh um

583
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,140
about the seek payload it has

584
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,120
um the the rule and whatever compression

585
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,159
and residue for that and then the

586
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,799
payload it's very very

587
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,100
Squishy in each case you have something

588
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,140
different going on it's very hard to

589
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,120
Define it's literally by case-by-case

590
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,559
basis

591
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,740
um there um there's no protocol numbers

592
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,900
we could use for this we do need

593
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,520
something new next slide

594
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,059
um but there's a question can we really

595
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,799
introduce the new protocol

596
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,620
um number in the next header um will it

597
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,860
just work or will the routers drop this

598
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,860
and and and there's our ADC that's not a

599
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,240
problem

600
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,440
um

601
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,320
um and what about IP um fragmentation

602
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,380
well will result in this well seek has

603
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,340
its own

604
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,520
um fragmentation so we can potentially

605
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,380
pre-fragment knowing again what we may

606
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,419
be up against so we could be potentially

607
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,279
using the Chic fragmentation and not

608
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,120
having to then use IP fragmentation next

609
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,658
oops

610
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,240
um

611
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,580
so

612
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,760
it turns out once we head down this road

613
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,220
there is more

614
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,880
um the lpwan um people particularly on

615
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,600
Pascal of the May um says that you know

616
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,740
if we also have Chic as an ether type

617
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,720
um there are secret cases use cases

618
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,240
where that that doesn't concern me but

619
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,520
Pascal has these cases in industrial

620
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,260
uses

621
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,700
um so you can talk about General case

622
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,919
for all of you answers instead all the

623
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,020
LPN specific cases we can talk about

624
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,059
generalizing it

625
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,880
um and uh obvious and then you can do an

626
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,640
IPv6 header compression on some 802

627
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,400
media so

628
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,760
though the draft right now only has

629
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,940
um requesting the IB protocol number

630
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,400
um the lpuan community says while we're

631
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,200
at it while we got this Pandora's Box

632
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,720
open maybe we should request all three

633
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,059
not just requests an IP protocol number

634
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,600
but also request an ether type and when

635
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,400
you got a firewall in the way and you

636
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,840
want to punch a hole through it you're

637
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,400
probably also going to have to do um

638
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,140
Chic even at the UDP level uh my fault

639
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,580
uh

640
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,740
so um

641
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,840
you know because I'm the author of RC

642
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,360
1918 and and next and all the rest of

643
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,600
that that nonsense uh and it's kato.bv6

644
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,440
uh so right now the draft is only asking

645
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,440
for for um the IP protocol number and

646
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,120
there's been a general acceptance on the

647
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,620
list that this is something worth worth

648
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,140
doing so there's a question to the work

649
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,140
group can I expand this

650
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,900
to also add in a quest for ether type

651
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,900
and request for for UDP port number or

652
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,840
do you want that as a separate effort so

653
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,460
that's like an open question to the

654
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,559
group of do we just simply take my draft

655
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,960
it is right now and do Last Call on it

656
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,539
for the for the port number or you say

657
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,059
yes Bob go back add in

658
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,580
for The Ether type and add in for the

659
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,100
UDP port and let's get all three at one

660
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,960
time so that's a question for the work

661
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,820
group what I'm going to do and and if

662
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,559
it's and it is just the port number

663
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,240
please let's get last call and let's

664
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,760
wrap this up otherwise I will rev the

665
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,580
document in the next two weeks

666
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,380
okay we have Eric in the queue

667
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,779
yeah it was everything Cisco first

668
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,240
without any hat about my reaction about

669
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,279
a people to call number

670
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,220
do you don't need router updates on that

671
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,900
right we made some tests in these

672
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,900
excerpts for extension headers which are

673
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,640
much more complex in the protocol number

674
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,679
so specifically in the case you

675
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,940
mentioned Aviation the network will be

676
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,919
there I said limited domain but at least

677
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,140
under a single operating system operator

678
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,480
so I'm pretty sure that they make the

679
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,059
device uh allowing this API protocol

680
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,679
number so for me that's not a problem

681
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,860
now putting my ID at

682
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,980
you have been adopted just for nappy

683
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,500
protocol number okay if you want to do

684
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,820
this the first one

685
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,460
this is sensible right to be honest but

686
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,919
we we need to redo an adoption call

687
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,320
and the UDP Port is not in interior

688
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,260
okay okay

689
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,039
that's the only place in the ietf

690
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,399
so you know it's uh you know I am the

691
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,220
Messenger on those I don't need that but

692
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,640
but it's like again like

693
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,840
if it makes sense we brought together

694
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,580
let's do it if it doesn't make sense

695
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,860
there'll be separate drafts separate

696
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,840
requests

697
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,820
hey babe

698
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,460
David black responding to Eric's comment

699
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,200
that it's not interior so I'm in the

700
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,620
transport area and I'm here to help you

701
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,980
um Bob get them all at once and for for

702
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,440
just just just for everybody's sanity

703
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,720
that way when somebody's trying to do

704
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,820
Chic and figuring out how to identify it

705
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,260
and all the weird things that got to put

706
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,659
it through everything they need to do it

707
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,700
is all in one place and you'll be much

708
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,159
better off with that draft to find the

709
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,500
UDP port and allocating it then having

710
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,360
to go dig through the registry to figure

711
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,899
out where we hit it

712
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:52,559
so

713
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,539
um

714
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:56,520
we can do at home and so forth but if if

715
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,679
the consensus is that we got to pull it

716
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,020
back and I got to add this in I will add

717
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,880
it in pull it back and bring it back

718
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,200
then for

719
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,140
um um work group adoption

720
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,640
on that I think I have one more side

721
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,340
which is just basically wrapping it up

722
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,419
okay

723
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,220
all right one more slide there I think I

724
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,279
do so we so the review the draft at

725
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,860
either types and needed for course and

726
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,899
then actually not start work with last

727
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:24,299
calls rather uh re

728
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,840
um re-adoption is what it's meant to be

729
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,520
um is that has that been the consensus

730
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,679
here and of course I'll take it to the

731
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,740
list as we are required to do but I

732
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,140
would like to get uh the feel for the uh

733
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,539
Community here Bob

734
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,600
so sorry uh we have two people before

735
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,899
you

736
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,919
are so yeah no so sorry I'll just take

737
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,020
it first because uh I I have some

738
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,200
something to say so

739
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
perhaps uh we'll hear more details about

740
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,919
this but uh it sounds to me that that we

741
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,539
need to coordinate this between interior

742
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,419
and transporter so so the calls ideally

743
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:07,860
uh us uh David and Eric voiced uh I I

744
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,899
agree it's it's important it's probably

745
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,820
easier to do it all at once and it's

746
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,460
clear for people understanding but we do

747
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,000
need to involve uh transport uh to be

748
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,659
before publishing and to avoid issues so

749
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:23,880
just something to keep in mind that this

750
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,080
will span Beyond interior

751
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:33,360
um I'll just um disagree that you need

752
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,640
to do another adoption call for this I

753
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,659
mean it's

754
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,159
the adoption call was that the working

755
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,960
group wanted to work on this

756
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,940
part of that discussion is there's two

757
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,620
other things to add to the document I

758
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,000
think that's fine it's still eventually

759
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,380
going to go through a working group last

760
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,600
call and then then there's the consensus

761
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,299
so I don't think we need to do another

762
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:55,460
adoption call to add these two things

763
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,620
so just a quick question like it's not

764
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,120
for this group but like something for

765
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,799
you to take back

766
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,500
um did lp1 have some kind of proof of

767
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,240
concept implementation of how this like

768
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,980
ether type thing would work because I

769
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,100
think there might be like uh so if if I

770
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,720
go back like what is the V6 header

771
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,740
compression is it going to be like six

772
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,360
low pan had a compression or what is it

773
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,559
going to be or is it going to be Chic

774
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,340
all the way do you know uh

775
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,779
Pascal asked me about this yesterday

776
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,299
morning okay so I really don't know do

777
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,279
you know his suitcase can you get the

778
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,399
mic

779
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,720
I'll check all the way okay cool okay no

780
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,159
I think like it'll be good to kind of

781
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,140
like you know just like nail it on like

782
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,179
see how it's gonna work and just I think

783
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,820
it's okay doing all together yeah

784
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,000
I will put in the no why we want to do

785
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,880
it in the draft no why do we want a Chic

786
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,919
ether type as well I just wanted to say

787
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,440
please give it to me I'll say no

788
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,600
particular use case we'll be in in the

789
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,519
in the document and I'll see that that

790
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,740
they'll be where people give me text for

791
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,419
that

792
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,600
David David black and do the same thing

793
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,519
for you to be UDP Port request right

794
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,159
right the paragraph for why you need it

795
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,280
uh uh fire firewall firewall pinhole

796
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,719
poke if there's particularly you've got

797
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,460
to do you gotta report for it just just

798
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,320
write that up I mean my my gut reaction

799
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,659
to all this is that Sheik is is

800
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,580
efficiently interesting new protocol

801
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,099
that a UDP Port request uh if it went

802
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,960
just straight straight into Ian I would

803
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,399
probably would probably get Grand anyhow

804
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,780
so might as well do it in the draft and

805
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,699
do it all in one place

806
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,040
um most recent up is is yeah there's

807
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,239
some footage coordination do the

808
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,859
transport area but don't don't get don't

809
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,418
get all excited about it this one this

810
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,179
one feels routine okay thank you thank

811
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,639
you uh I will do it and I'll work with

812
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,639
with uh my colleagues in lpwan get the

813
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,940
strap around and uh and and submit it as

814
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,099
quickly as I can so we can keep keep

815
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:51,960
moving this forward and I thank you for

816
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,780
your time and uh I look at doing some

817
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,879
very interesting things

818
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,900
um for

819
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,940
um wide area Wireless

820
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,800
um from from aircraft both man and

821
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,839
unmanned being able to use this and be

822
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,780
much more smart in how we use that very

823
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,540
small budgeted networks thank you for

824
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,040
your time thank you thanks

825
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,680
um all right so next one is uh Fred

826
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,720
online

827
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,140
favorite

828
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,740
uh can you see here yes now we can hear

829
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,579
it

830
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,560
okay

831
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,440
so uh since the last meeting when I

832
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,579
briefed IP Parcels I have taken

833
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:39,839
okay

834
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,060
I've taken the step of implementing IP

835
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,119
Parcels this is running code next chart

836
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,480
please

837
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,040
this is the implementation elements

838
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,200
essentially IP Parcels is split between

839
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,200
the Linux kernel and I'm using the dtn

840
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,440
ltp UDP application for the application

841
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,660
layer framing of parcels

842
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,440
next chart

843
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,940
these are the modules that were updated

844
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,859
in the Linux kernel and the ind-10

845
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:09,300
implementation

846
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,020
next chart

847
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,420
uh these are details about the Omni

848
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,180
interface that makes Parcels capable and

849
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,920
the thing to note about this is that has

850
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,760
an MTO slightly under 64k bytes

851
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,359
next chart

852
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,359
this is what a UDP ipv4 parcel looks

853
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,000
like I won't go into the details about

854
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
what it all is in here uh next chart

855
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,520
this is more of the same parcel

856
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,280
next chart

857
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,440
more of the parcel

858
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,160
next chart

859
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,599
still more of the parcel

860
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,240
next chart

861
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,099
and finally the end of the parcel this

862
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:59,940
parcel is 64k bytes about 40 pages of

863
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,800
this text are are represented in a

864
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,240
single parcel

865
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,880
next chart

866
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,859
this is talking about single segment

867
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,720
performance what happens when you vary

868
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,079
the size of the segment to larger sizes

869
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,920
next chart

870
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,060
and this is about multi-segment

871
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,099
performance this is what happens when

872
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:21,839
you pack multiple segments into the same

873
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,980
parcel

874
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,640
next chart

875
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,380
so here the next steps that need to be

876
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,140
done in the implementation

877
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,799
next chart

878
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,160
into the backups now in next chart

879
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,320
and here's where you can go to find the

880
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,640
source to experiment with Parcels

881
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,879
yourself

882
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,040
that's all I have time for I'll take any

883
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,000
questions that there might be

884
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,540
foreign

885
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:59,720
go to the previous chart please

886
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,680
are there any questions for Fred

887
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,000
we have Eric thank you

888
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,020
so everything the responsibility for

889
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,359
this entire working group so Fred thank

890
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,500
you for the explanation and the Showcase

891
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,660
if you wonder why we still have this

892
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,640
presentation even if the code for

893
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,280
adoption was closed in the sense that

894
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,680
not adopted

895
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,079
we gave simply a last chance to this

896
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,780
effort run thread to get some energy and

897
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,880
enthusiasm on this

898
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,300
so cool for adoption is close it will

899
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,980
stay close except if I see some other

900
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,200
people ask oh I've seen this each I

901
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,000
changed my mind

902
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,119
okay and I want to do it and close it

903
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,020
end of this week so by seeing this

904
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,060
and the explanation of thread I'm pretty

905
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,800
sure that Fred is still available online

906
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,060
later

907
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,880
you think it's fantastic work I want to

908
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,940
review I want to get this adopted do it

909
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,280
until the end of this week and then we

910
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,720
will reopen the code for adoption and

911
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,859
official one

912
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,540
okay until now it's closed you stay

913
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,560
close

914
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,720
if I we don't see the chair and myself

915
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,420
enthusiastic people say I want to reopen

916
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,460
the code of adoption we want to open it

917
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,380
end of this week

918
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,599
thank you Fred

919
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,300
thank you ready okay I think so as you

920
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,339
heard if you have any interest support

921
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,260
or curiosity about this presentation

922
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,780
please voice it and send a email on the

923
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,520
mailing list

924
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,140
you're encouraged to do so

925
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,720
yeah he's here

926
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,859
stepped out of cheering the meeting next

927
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,640
door to come over here

928
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,760
all right

929
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,740
so uh the purpose of this is to

930
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,420
advertise a side meeting that is

931
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,220
tomorrow

932
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,680
um ebpf if you don't know evpf I will

933
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,420
give you a quick intro in about two

934
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,380
minutes

935
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,240
uh and then we'll talk about what the

936
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,680
actual purpose of the side meeting is

937
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,619
because it's a really non-technical side

938
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:23,940
meeting it's more of a process side

939
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,280
meeting so next slide

940
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,800
uh by the way uh I am doing this

941
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,380
presentation wearing a couple of hats my

942
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,740
other hat is within the evpf foundation

943
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,000
which was recently created to sponsor

944
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,300
open source uh projects uh the UDF

945
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,420
Foundation has a technical uh uh

946
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,339
committee and I am one of the members of

947
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:45,660
the ebpf foundation's technical

948
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,800
committee

949
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,839
all right so if you don't know ebpf some

950
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:51,540
of you do some of you may be may not

951
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,700
um this is a definition ebpf is a

952
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,099
cross-platform technology that can run

953
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,200
sandbox programs to extend a privileged

954
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,060
system component so if you ask me what

955
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,800
does ebpf stand for the answer is it

956
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,020
doesn't stand for anything

957
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,660
BPF stood for something ebpf does not

958
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,280
next slide

959
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,079
so the best analogy that I could give

960
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,220
and I'm going to stretch it just a

961
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,180
little bit here

962
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,000
is that JavaScript is to the browser

963
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,060
what ebpf is to an OS kernel

964
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,119
so for example JavaScript isn't just for

965
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,480
browsers evpf isn't just for OS kernels

966
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,160
but that's the dominant case and so what

967
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,160
JavaScript to the browser is it said you

968
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,140
are not beholden to however the browser

969
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,640
shipped whatever that functionality was

970
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,920
because you can extend it with things

971
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,140
that you can download and and it allowed

972
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,240
the browser to be programmable

973
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,820
OS kernel is the same thing do I have to

974
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,380
wait for a new version of an OS kernel

975
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,180
ebpf allows extensibility without

976
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,560
waiting for new version just like

977
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,780
JavaScript did for the browser okay so

978
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,760
that's the rough analogy don't want to

979
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,359
carry it too far but that's next slide

980
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,740
there are multiple implementations the

981
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,660
most dominant one by far is in the Linux

982
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,280
kernel this is showing how components

983
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,660
are organized in the Linux kernel

984
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,240
implementation adpf is also in say

985
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,700
offload cards if I want to extend a

986
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,400
hardware card then those that support

987
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,440
ebpf you can download a program into a

988
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,540
card and run things there but in the

989
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,480
Linux example the red lines consider

990
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,599
what is untrusted okay and so you start

991
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,920
off by writing a program in your

992
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,859
language of choice C rust go whatever

993
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,440
it gets compiled into ebpf program byte

994
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,660
code

995
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,079
and then a any application can use a

996
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,900
library to load that byte code into the

997
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,079
uh privileged context by sending it to a

998
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,300
verifier that verifiers a static

999
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,460
verifier that runs a proof

1000
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,300
if it can prove that that code is

1001
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,859
actually safe meaning it only touches

1002
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:50,099
safe memory it uh it actually halts

1003
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:51,660
meaning it doesn't now have an infinite

1004
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,920
Loop or whatever if it can actually

1005
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,079
prove that then it can continue to pass

1006
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,400
then it's considered green at that point

1007
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,319
okay if it can't prove if it's

1008
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,540
indeterminate it's rejected okay

1009
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,420
and so once it's provably safe according

1010
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,339
to the definitions of the verifier then

1011
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,140
it can be jit compiled and run natively

1012
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,579
and interact with the component like the

1013
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,859
TCP stack and it can expose shared

1014
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,180
memory that things can interact with

1015
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,619
according to whatever the actuals are on

1016
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:15,599
that shared memory okay that's what evpf

1017
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,160
is it's a way of extending stuff with

1018
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,900
the the key security aspect is how the

1019
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,460
verifier works okay so that's what ebpf

1020
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,980
is all right and again this is the Linux

1021
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,480
kernel other implementations have

1022
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,099
different Assemblies of is there a user

1023
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:27,599
space a kernel space or whatever because

1024
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,099
it's extending a privileged system

1025
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,859
context this is showing the kernel could

1026
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,200
be a network card could be a user mode

1027
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,700
demon that's privileged whatever it is

1028
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,500
okay so next slide

1029
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,099
so I'm not you know roughly what ebpf is

1030
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:43,380
there is a desire to standardize some of

1031
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,339
those things as you get more

1032
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:46,380
cross-platform and implementation more

1033
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,480
network cards and so on

1034
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,560
um

1035
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,680
these are a number of areas that are

1036
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,540
expected to be desirable to standardize

1037
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,400
we have other organizations like nvme

1038
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,440
that need a referenceable spec because

1039
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,940
they want to take a dependency on some

1040
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,560
of the ebpf you know definitions and

1041
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,440
functionality and so if nvma nvme and

1042
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,780
other sdos want to point to us back what

1043
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,000
is the right place to have a spec to do

1044
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,260
and so here are seven different

1045
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,560
categories of things that that are

1046
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,660
different boxes or arrows in the

1047
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,240
previous slide that makes sense to

1048
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,680
standardize some cross-platform things

1049
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,220
for it okay so next Slide the purpose of

1050
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,660
the side meeting

1051
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,540
is to decide what if any of those things

1052
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,640
might be on scope for the ietf does it

1053
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,200
make sense to actually have a buff here

1054
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,000
or is it better to take them elsewhere

1055
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,500
okay that's the purpose of the side

1056
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,339
beating so we're not going to get into

1057
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,960
the technical discussion it's going to

1058
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,339
be about those seven categories that

1059
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:39,240
says yeah you have actually an

1060
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,400
appropriate place or not right it's a

1061
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,960
hybrid meeting which means we'll have a

1062
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,280
bunch of the evpf community the Linux

1063
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,680
kernel people will be typically remote

1064
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,359
yeah you have people will be local and

1065
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:49,740
we can have the discussion between

1066
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,660
communities there are a couple of people

1067
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,099
that are actually in the overlap I'm one

1068
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:54,660
of them

1069
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,220
um I mean couple that are actually here

1070
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,500
all right so uh they want to take a

1071
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,359
normal dependency so the ebpf foundation

1072
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,220
is an open source organization but it

1073
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,200
could publish You Know PBS PDFs or

1074
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,420
whatever of specs right

1075
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,640
um some small seos publish things

1076
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,560
themselves and then take it to ISO to

1077
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,599
say give me an ISO number

1078
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,099
um that's very popular among the number

1079
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,380
of small sdos we could go independent

1080
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,359
stream RFC and we could do ietf RFC

1081
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:19,800
which some people have suggested and

1082
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,819
that's kind of the purpose the side

1083
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,339
meeting is to say does d make any sense

1084
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:25,859
or is D not appropriate for given the

1085
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,480
constraints here okay so if you have

1086
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,760
opinions on where this might be possible

1087
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,740
to go okay please come to the side

1088
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,300
meeting even if you think that IDF is

1089
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,740
not the right place that's the purpose

1090
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,420
of why it's not a buff okay it's a side

1091
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,060
being to say what is the right sdo okay

1092
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,680
and so if you're expecting to see lots

1093
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,880
of technical discussion that's probably

1094
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,140
not going to be their side meeting if

1095
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,540
you want to have uh here ietf is a good

1096
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,040
place to do it ietf is the wrong place

1097
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,420
to do it please come to the side meeting

1098
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,619
Thursday six to seven okay we do have a

1099
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,480
small room but it's virtual as well so

1100
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,160
you can come in on Zoom if the meeting

1101
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,900
if the room happens to be very full so

1102
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,819
we have the right now is the 12 person

1103
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:01,800
side meeting room and not the 40 person

1104
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,859
side meeting room so we'll see all right

1105
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:08,119
happy to answer any questions

1106
00:46:09,859 --> 00:46:13,619
uh are there any questions

1107
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,420
where people

1108
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,220
you can of course attend a side meeting

1109
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,540
but um yeah

1110
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,819
so I think Dave um I do like the D thing

1111
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:25,560
but I think we need to check with

1112
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,540
somebody who who

1113
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,460
owns this I don't know EB pay Foundation

1114
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,660
or somebody if they're willing to see

1115
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,220
Change Control right if it goes through

1116
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,079
an ITF RFC that's the only thing that

1117
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,880
came to my head that exactly that is

1118
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,859
exactly one of the discussions and so we

1119
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:40,140
had a uh pre-meeting with the area

1120
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,720
directors myself and two of the folks

1121
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,119
from the evpf community I mean people

1122
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,040
that actually have the um things and

1123
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,200
that was actually one of the topics

1124
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,400
um and so the the uh change control

1125
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,359
issue is less of the that is an issue

1126
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,819
but not a big issue the bigger issue is

1127
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:02,819
what is how fast can ebpf evolve

1128
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,700
and is ietf process able to accommodate

1129
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,839
that and so those are the types of

1130
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:08,940
questions that they actually have much

1131
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,680
more than say

1132
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,599
um you know is exceeding change control

1133
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:15,359
because the the risk is of course uh the

1134
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,680
ietf might do something that I've

1135
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,599
purchased from what the implementers do

1136
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,579
and I said well actually the IHF coacher

1137
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:21,780
is that iitf tends to do what the

1138
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,920
implementers do right if you don't

1139
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,240
actually have the implementations ATF

1140
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,859
will say we don't even want it here if

1141
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:26,760
we can't get enough people from the

1142
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,380
community right so the risk of that is I

1143
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,520
think low

1144
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,680
um but um I'm personally not sure that

1145
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,180
ietf is the right place but I'm willing

1146
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,460
to moderate it and give a fair shake so

1147
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,000
okay

1148
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:40,440
okay thank you very much any other

1149
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,740
question

1150
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,319
we have a question on the on the chat is

1151
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,420
the evpf site meeting

1152
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,960
on the ietf agenda page

1153
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,680
sorry oh okay it is on the side meetings

1154
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,780
page the itf1 if you do a search for

1155
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,720
iotf 115 side meetings uh you'll find it

1156
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,760
there tomorrow

1157
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,900
uh mezzanine 12 uh 6 p.m and if it would

1158
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,599
help I can send a mail to the interior
