1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,200
as well

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,799
we have time as in our agenda it's not

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,960
too tight

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,060
we have a buffer time of 10 minutes okay

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,400
maybe we can wait a couple

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,359
once for the video

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,559
there was food downstairs all right yes

8
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,140
it's the food that's why so it's gonna

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,180
take a while yeah very hard to compete

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,719
this is not working

11
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,300
I don't know I've not seen anything

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,079
you need to plug it in your yeah no no

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,879
but can either this should not work

14
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,979
because this is you're not doing screen

15
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,960
share we are doing the SlideShare

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,439
doesn't support it

17
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,159
there is no

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,979
keyboard

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,860
okay

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,640
um

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,479
hello everyone

22
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,798
hello hi John

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,680
we propose to wait for a couple more

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,439
minutes there are beverage downstairs so

25
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,020
for people on medical Don't Panic the PC

26
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,240
walking group session will start

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,280
but just wait for people during the room

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,220
about

29
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,300
like take that operational seconds but

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,180
it makes a lot of sense to me

31
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,420
would certainly be

32
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,020
easier to progress I think

33
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,180
we've had a couple documents recently at

34
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,020
the top chat

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,859
a bunch of other stuff

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,940
like that

37
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,959
but it's easier

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,619
take all the information

39
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,540
yeah yeah

40
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,300
thanks thank you John

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,180
suspects okay

42
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,659
hello again everyone we propose to start

43
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,519
this is the past competition element

44
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,019
work group session

45
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,379
so as you may be aware November 11 is a

46
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,659
special day for many countries so in the

47
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,799
UK it's

48
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,280
quite uh significant so

49
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,840
just as a reminder for people involved

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,220
at War

51
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,120
was nice to mention the specific date

52
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,360
okay back to our ietf business the usual

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
not well you should be all familiar with

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,420
them especially we're on Friday already

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,280
so usual IPR request on the ATF

56
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,620
processes from the ATF and

57
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,120
you should

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,418
get down to those reference if you don't

59
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:26,180
our Hardware already aware of them

60
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,720
okay

61
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,840
mixed meeting again people are joining

62
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,720
both from the room on mythical so we use

63
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,500
the medical tool to manage the cues so

64
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,560
that's the main impact for people on

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,780
site remember to learn the queue using

66
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,120
the medical tool there is a light one

67
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,240
that is appropriate for mobile phones or

68
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,540
laptops for Riemann participants you

69
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,120
know the deal you you're already using

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,940
the medical app whatever

71
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,440
thanks next

72
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,580
uh the usual pointers that you may be

73
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,120
aware of

74
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,540
there is no one on the minutes there

75
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,220
it's after

76
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,240
the data yeah

77
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,619
um the guideline for conducts

78
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,259
nothing new there but it's always

79
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,580
useful to remind them

80
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,979
so we have Harry acting as a mini taker

81
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,979
but as usual if you want to give him a

82
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,120
hand it's always useful especially if

83
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,600
you were involved in discussion

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,360
um for people on site name spelling

85
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,639
checking

86
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,460
could be useful so

87
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,979
you may join the minutes on the link

88
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,919
there and give Harry a run when you feel

89
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,000
like it

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,720
thanks

91
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,800
um usual reminder on the process in the

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
ATF especially on the use of the mailing

93
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,560
list we know that from time to time

94
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
there are many things happening in the

95
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,660
background

96
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,319
so remind let's remind that ITF process

97
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,840
is based on touching consensus to

98
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,479
progress work so this needs to be

99
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,919
visible at some point on the mailing

100
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,639
list there are also some critical steps

101
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,400
on the ATF process related to the main

102
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,580
Linux use so when it comes to working

103
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,759
with last calls document adoption and so

104
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,039
on the more people are involved the

105
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,139
easier it is for the chairs to judge on

106
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,060
the consensus on the support of a given

107
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,840
work item we also manage a Wiki

108
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,400
especially to keep an eye on the

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,180
existing queue for document adoption on

110
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,360
working of last calls there's still some

111
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,199
backlog there but it's improving

112
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,759
so

113
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,039
feel free to

114
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,199
update in cases we missed any item there

115
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,120
the chat that may access directly from

116
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,819
that link or also using the medical tool

117
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,340
is already up and running

118
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,099
and in case you need some implementation

119
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:34,800
with interrupt on

120
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,680
there are some opportunities to request

121
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,860
a code point from the Ayana

122
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,919
so it's been used in the past for a few

123
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,840
drafts and please don't forget to go

124
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,060
through that process in case there are

125
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,280
interoperability at stake in the short

126
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,599
term because

127
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,240
it's easier to get a record point and

128
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,419
modify existing deployment later in the

129
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,699
process so you don't necessarily have to

130
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,220
wait for full RFC status to

131
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,160
use that code point from the Ayana

132
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,400
the agenda no change from the published

133
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,780
one any one want to bash anything

134
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,080
hope not

135
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,500
okay so let's move on

136
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,379
hello reviews so as you may be aware

137
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,860
there has been some suggesting uh

138
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,839
process about early reviews in the

139
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,059
rooting area

140
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,860
uh the good news is that from the PC

141
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,399
standpoint we will use the um

142
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,320
earlier review process from time to time

143
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,500
so nothing brand new from the PC

144
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,440
perspective but it good to see that it's

145
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,779
a jewelry guideline that we are already

146
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,240
following and that it's another that is

147
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,160
enlarging uh we feel it's a very useful

148
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,100
process step to consider early reviews

149
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,519
from the rooting area perspective as you

150
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,279
may know we usually get interesting

151
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,880
feedback from the reviewers

152
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,120
so it's good to see this process with an

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,899
enlarged scope and we will

154
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,700
keep on using that good

155
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,680
step or way of conduct

156
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,060
in case yeah documentary referring uh

157
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,180
to balance the work on how the

158
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,899
the chairs flushed the queues

159
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:45,959
using Shepherd for the last stage of the

160
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,200
document is a useful way so if you're

161
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
interested

162
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,980
uh please

163
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,800
contact the chairs we'd be happy to

164
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,620
discuss with you what document would be

165
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,680
relevant for you to Shepherd that's a

166
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,160
useful way for the shepherd to to

167
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,399
understand the ATF process especially in

168
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,660
the last stages

169
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,420
and for the chair to balance the work uh

170
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,480
we thank Harry who's been already taking

171
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,000
some of them as a shepherd and if there

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,019
are other people happy to to join our PC

173
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,720
usual shipper that would be great from

174
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,680
the chair perspective

175
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,880
so working good status

176
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,839
we have no numeracy since the last ITF

177
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,200
meeting but the work has still been

178
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,620
progressing quite well uh three of the

179
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,560
documents and the in the RFC editor

180
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,420
queue one of them is

181
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,940
has been blocked for a while

182
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,579
pending for a spring document or no

183
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,160
segment voting document which is work in

184
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,940
progress so uh we hope to resolve that

185
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,880
dependency in a short term or reasonable

186
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,760
term

187
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,300
uh the other ones are progressing so we

188
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,300
can hope that by the next ITF meeting we

189
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,279
will have

190
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,079
several addresses published

191
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,839
uh we have to order a documents in the

192
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,839
iuc hand

193
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,620
so that's him the regular

194
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,100
level of cues in uh working group which

195
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,019
is live which has a document progressing

196
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,160
towards iot studies

197
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,779
apart from that we have a recent

198
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,620
Collision that came from the it UT so we

199
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,480
need to join the

200
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,940
routing array for there to update the

201
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,920
list of relevant documents that we will

202
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,940
point

203
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,880
to the igut when responding to their

204
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,060
license so it's a usual communication

205
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,160
between the gsdu

206
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,640
so nothing special to mention there if

207
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,519
you feel there would be something to

208
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,800
point out specifically ready to given

209
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,440
work please contact the chairs otherwise

210
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,320
we will probably just send an updated

211
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,420
list of relevant documents for them

212
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,019
we also have a reminder of the existing

213
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:29,459
heli code Poitier location from the

214
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:33,000
Ayana there with the deadlines so

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,440
everything in 2024 for the next steps

216
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,180
some have been renewed some are

217
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,600
progressing towards Seas so

218
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,519
everything's fine so far at this stage

219
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,060
for corporate allocation

220
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,920
okay so a little flow to my co-chair

221
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,000
hi everyone we'll now talk about all the

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,040
working group documents just a reminder

223
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,320
in our agenda we had only one working

224
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,360
group document with status is being

225
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,940
presented but working group documents

226
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,680
are very important this is where we have

227
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,620
the consensus to progress the work so

228
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,959
please use this time if there is any

229
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,639
open issue that you have with these

230
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,860
documents or if there is any feedback

231
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,120
that you want to provide to the working

232
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,160
group it's very this is the key work

233
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,380
that we want to progress as part of our

234
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,300
working group activities and that's why

235
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,760
I have put a little bit uh time on the

236
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,680
agenda for all our working group

237
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
documents as well

238
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,660
so let's start with the first one uh

239
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,079
this I am a co-author and uh Julian is

240
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,380
shepherding the uh the document the

241
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,120
document is currently still in the

242
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
working group last call stage it has not

243
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,519
been closed uh we got comments from uh

244
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,500
Tom patch specially related to the use

245
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,880
of TLS 1.3 and there is a document today

246
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,300
on the agenda which talks about how psip

247
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,120
can use TLS 1.3 as well as from the Yang

248
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,639
point of view it also has a slide there

249
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,820
where how we plan to how we have already

250
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,579
handled the comment that came from Tom

251
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,880
and then uh once that is done most

252
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,240
likely I'll ask my co-chair to progress

253
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,940
the document to The Next Step as far as

254
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,060
update is concerned uh apart from TLS

255
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,120
1.3 issue the main changes was we had a

256
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,120
new RFC for flow spec capability so that

257
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,700
capability flag was missing so that got

258
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,120
added and related to security also in

259
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,579
the igp we had a recent document that

260
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,740
went through igp they're also based on

261
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,800
the comments in the Ops uh section some

262
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,480
some things was pointing out which we

263
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,399
have updated in the Yang model as well

264
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,820
so everything is well aligned and we

265
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,500
hope that this document which is a very

266
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,120
important document for p sub this is the

267
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,060
base Yang model for us would soon see

268
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,040
publication

269
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,680
is there any comments please use this

270
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,220
time uh people in the room or online if

271
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,740
you have any thoughts we have some time

272
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,300
for discussion on the any of these

273
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,699
documents I encourage you to come to the

274
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,819
mic

275
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,399
so this is the document on which the

276
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,160
binding set is waiting this is the uh

277
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,720
our srv6 document uh the authors have

278
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,820
made an update there was also a comment

279
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,000
from midmoy regarding some error codes

280
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,060
that were misaligned between srmpls and

281
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,899
srv6 and authors did a pass for not just

282
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,880
that error code but all the error codes

283
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,160
and I think in the latest update they

284
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,019
have handled this well so please review

285
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,260
and we need to progress this document uh

286
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,959
next uh because as we just talked about

287
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,240
it that it's blocking one of the

288
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,399
documents in RFC editor queue as well as

289
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,300
this document has Ina allocation which

290
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,740
is going to expire though we can of

291
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,740
course ask for renew uh no this one I

292
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,600
think maybe we cannot ask for a new it's

293
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,519
like two things already run so we should

294
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,920
progress this and get it out in the

295
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,839
normal process of course we can ask ads

296
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,660
permission but let's try to do what we

297
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,540
promised to the working room uh and if

298
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,000
anybody has any concerns please let us

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,500
know

300
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,440
uh the other set of documents which are

301
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,240
almost nearing working group plus call

302
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,860
we have a document related to Native IP

303
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,399
uh this RFC uh the corresponding RFC is

304
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,959
already published in teas working group

305
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,160
uh there was uh there is it has things

306
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,000
related to bgp and uh John in past it

307
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,920
have pointed out to the IDR mailing list

308
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,779
it got discussed in the IDR mailing list

309
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,540
idea chairs gave some comments which

310
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,880
authors have also handled so I think we

311
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,740
have done our due diligence and we are

312
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,899
ready to send this document and do

313
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,639
working with last call and of course

314
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,800
notify IDR about working group last call

315
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,320
as well so we will do that soon

316
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,600

317
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,059

received many comments the authors

320
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,000
haven't made any big changes looks to be

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,220
okay but if you have any concerns please

322

327

1114 meeting and I'm

328

331
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,320
other things which is also giving a

332
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,080
signal that we could see what to do but

authors as well as to the working group

337
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,260
and we will be making a decision very

338
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,679
very soon

339
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,980
so rest of the working group IDs uh we

340
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,140
have path segment document this has been

341
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,940
updated uh mainly editorial change uh

342
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,160
be asked an explicit question in 114

343
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,860
that currently this document has two

344
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,500
ways of doing the same thing it uses PCC

345
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,860
mechanism as well as using the tlv we

346
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,299
have done that in the past it's still

347
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,980
aligned but we wanted to give the

348
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,720
opportunity to the working group to make

349
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,520
sure that they are aware that there are

350
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,980
two mechanisms being standardized and if

351
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,020
there is an issue please voice it out

352
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,299
now otherwise the author's preferences

353
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,520
to use both the mechanisms and they have

354
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,200
Justified that in the document as well

355
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,720
so please review and give your feedback

356
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,360
that's the only issue otherwise I think

357
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,760
path segment in Spring is progressing

358
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,460
quite well so we should be doing that in

359
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,820
PC as well and Publishing this soon

360
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,799
a similar document is about

361
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,140
bi-directional path again mainly

362
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,240
editorial changes looks to be pretty

363
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,940
stable has a similar work is already

364
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,520
done uh

365
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,760
so we will be progressing that soon so I

366
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,120
think we have a question Ahmad uh go

367
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,239
ahead

368
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,059
oh looks like it was by mistake so let's

369
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,980
continue

370
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,820
uh then we have a documents related to

371
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,240
Sr policy Sr policy candidate path this

372
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,679
has been mainly a refresh uh from our

373
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,620
look it seems to be ready like we

374
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,539
haven't had a major update in a while it

375
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,299
was presented in the past ITF has good

376
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,419
support so we will be putting this into

377
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,760
almost ready for working group last call

378
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,039
queue so if people have any thoughts

379
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,580
comments implementers please uh give

380
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,220
your feedback on this document soon

381
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,080
the second one is PCC Sr again no major

382
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,039
update

383
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,080
looks like nearing working plus call if

384
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,539
you have an issue uh please let us know

385
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,340
so with the idea of presenting the

386
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,080
statuses we just want to know what our

387
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,900
thinking is so it gives you gives the

388
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,480
working group an opportunity also to uh

389
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,120
to align and review and give feedback

390
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,220
timely rather than at the wait for the

391
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,200
working group last call only better to

392
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,880
do handle comments as a part of working

393
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,179
group process itself

394
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,380
a multipath has not seen an update but

395
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,900
it is being used uh it has been

396
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,419
implemented the implemented multiple

397
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,880
vendors claim to implement this so which

398
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,160
is good so we would like to progress

399
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,440
this as well soon

400
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,679
uh State synchronization not have been

401
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,100
has not been updated one issue which I

402
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,799
it might be a personal issue that I have

403
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,280
is that document doesn't talk about uh

404
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,980
how to set primary and secondary it says

405
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,080
it's out of scope but anybody who's

406
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,000
implementing it would have to have some

407
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,580
knobs so I wanted to make sure that

408
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,980
people are okay with it to not keep that

409
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,200
part of as a part of the document

410
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,600
and keep this out of scope if you

411
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,520
disagree please use our mailing list and

412
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,320
and let's discuss this

413
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
uh the next set of documents are PC

414
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,980
optional no update looks to be ready

415
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,880
uh we have uh if anybody has any

416
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,179
objection please use the mailing list

417
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,220
we have a document stateful into domain

418
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,620
it has expired it has not been updated

419
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,960
but the authors have told that they have

420
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,780
planned to make an update soon and also

421
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,780
they plan to handle the comment related

422
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,580
to enhanced error which I was earlier

423
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,100
talking about that whether this document

424
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,000
can use the extension that is uh that is

425
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,860
suggested in the enhanced error for

426
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,460
stateful interdomain I also there was a

427
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,140
document in the spring working group as

428
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,860
well which was talking about interdomain

429
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,380
currently they focus only on a single PC

430
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,840
case I did bring it up that if they want

431
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,900
to handle multiple pce this will be the

432
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,880
approach of stateful interdomain that

433
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,220
they can explore so that is also

434
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,679
something worth checking across working

435
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,140
group as well

436
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,140
with respect to SRP to employee policy

437
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,120
there has been no update but this is one

438
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,980
of the recent adopted working group

439
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,600
documents so let's give it time for

440
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,719
people to adjust and Implement Etc

441
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,299
uh L2 flow spec this was the document

442
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,880
that was moved out of the original flow

443
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,580
spec document mainly because of IDR flow

444
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,900
spec V2 work it is basically pending uh

445
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,900
the flow spec V2 work to happen in IDR

446
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,840
as well as the L2 flow spec being

447
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,539
published in IDR once those two are done

448
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,400
in the idea working group then I think

449
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,520
psap work can also progress so right now

450
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,500
we are on the waiting stage as far as

451
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,220
the L2 flow spec document is concerned

452
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,480
the Sid algo was adopted I think uh two

453
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
ideas ago currently it's in the expired

454
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,220
state so it's a zero zero draft that

455
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,559
that's been expired they are even

456
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,840
pending comments from the working group

457
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,700
adoption stage so I really request

458
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,240
authors to uh refresh this work like

459
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,340
there is all this energy during adoption

460
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,159
but after adoption authors kind of

461
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,080
forget about the work so that should not

462
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,419
happen please refresh your work please

463
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,039
keep it updated please handle the

464
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,600
comments that you received during

465
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,640
adoption process just a reminder to

466
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,820
everyone

467
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,200
and some recent documents we had peace

468
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,380
up uh path MTO when we adopted this work

469
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,140
uh we we are we pointed out that there

470
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,059
should be a work in Spring that should

471
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,919
coordinate this that should Define what

472
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,039
path MTO is in Sr policy context and

473
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,260
both IDR document and P sub document

474
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,140
should refer to that the new ID has been

475
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,360
published in Spring it's been presented

476
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,299
twice now uh hopefully it will get

477
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,640
adopted there as well and then the

478
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,620
dependencies will also be clear and we

479
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,460
can progress the work uh in peace up as

480
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,360
well

481
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,000
uh we have a document iFit which is

482
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,860
anyway on the agenda so I will leave it

483
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,200
out for the uh for the actual

484
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,360
presentation

485
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,299
uh a recent adopted document we have

486
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,299
srv6 Yang which is adopted it is of

487
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,980
course being dependent on our peace of

488
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,200
yank so let's publish that and then we

489
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,059
can make progress good thing is that

490
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,700
it's been updated and the alignment work

491
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,440
between PCP and srv6 yang as ongoing one

492
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,240
thing to note is the document is called

493
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,140
srv6 yank but it has Sr policy as well

494
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,679
as srv6 stuff so please take a note of

495
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,440
it that the document name may not

496
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,480
actually reflect what uh what it

497
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,520
actually it contains both the things so

498
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,340
please be aware of that

499
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,799
we have a working group adoption called

500
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,880
queue uh it's in the wiki uh please give

501
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,640
us feedback if you have a need for for

502
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,380
instance you are implementing it and you

503
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,500
need code points and you want to uh fast

504
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,120
track something your chairs are

505
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,240
listening please reach out we try to

506
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,280
keep our Wiki up to date so that you

507
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,919
have visibility on where the cues are

508
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,140
what's the priority that we are thinking

509
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,020
so please use our Wiki as well

510
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,880
so we have two discussions the key

511
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,380
discussions that happen between the

512
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,820
meeting and we wanted to just highlight

513
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,740
that in the working group session as

514
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,539
well and give people time if they want

515
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,940
to talk about it further uh there was a

516
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,820
proposal for how to enable BFD there

517
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,100
were multiple suggestions whether we use

518
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,840
Association whether we use some other

519
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,720
mechanism but uh all those things are

520
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,760
currently still only on the mailing list

521
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,580
so I have sent a personal message also

522
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,440
to the authors that let's bring the work

523
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,539
into ITF by writing your first internet

524
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:06,120
draft so that we can follow ITF process

525
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,220
and give comments rather than like you

526
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,080
know exchanging Word documents and doing

527
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,200
this that's not how we do work in ITF so

528
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,700
I'm waiting for the internet draft to be

529
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,279
published and then we can

530
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,659
move work forward

531
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,640
uh the second discussion that was

532
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,500
happening was with respect to PC

533
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,720
operational draft this was presented in

534
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,240
the last meeting and we did discuss what

535
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,820
should be the next step whether we

536
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,760
should break the document into two uh

537
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,520
have a very clear uh standards track

538
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,320
document which clearly says what needs

539
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,020
to be updated and have a much more

540
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,419
bigger clarification document that talks

541
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,679
about uh how to apply uh PC in various

542
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:48,179
different stateful PC in various

543
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,740
different scenarios give clear

544
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,740
description uh this has been discussed

545
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,740
we started a thread a thread kind of

546
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,620
mellowed down I did respond yesterday we

547
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,539
got one more response and I see now John

548
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,360
wants to say something as well so the

549
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
queue is open

550
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,320
thanks John scooter excuse me um yeah so

551
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,000
I I

552
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,100
saw your your comment and thanks for

553
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,360
teeing this up

554
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,140
um

555
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,900
and went and just very quickly glanced

556
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,539
through the current state of the draft

557
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,200
um

558
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,659
I

559
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,000
we can

560
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,440
speaking you know

561
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,480
in terms of like sort of progressing it

562
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,600
through the iesg we can do it either way

563
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,320
as you know one unified draft or as two

564
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,240
separate drafts as as you proposed

565
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,240
through but I will say that I think it

566
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,820
will go more smoothly I mean often I

567
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,559
would prefer to have one draft just to

568
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,260
progress fewer documents but I think it

569
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,360
will actually go more smoothly to have

570
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,559
one

571
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,200
tiny standards track document that's

572
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,620
very crisp and clear

573
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,620
and one informational document that can

574
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,919
provide as much color commentary and

575
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,659
detail as you know the working group

576
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,039
deems necessary

577
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,720
so just you know from sort of my selfish

578
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,400
perspective of of wanting to have an

579
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,900
easier time of being able to move it

580
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,480
through the iesg

581
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,240
um I would encourage you to consider

582
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,799
encourage the working group to consider

583
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,500
the the two document option thank you

584
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,400
thanks John

585
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:34,039
anyone no let's move on

586
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,740
uh this is again in our Wiki a page that

587
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,419
we created mainly focusing on

588
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,400
coordination with other working group

589
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,340
and research groups so again Wiki is

590
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,900
open to everyone it's not just for

591
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,580
chairs and securities to maintain it's

592
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,620
for the whole working group so when we

593
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,960
have any work that you are similarly

594
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,299
doing in some other working group where

595
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,700
the coordination is needed please come

596
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,400
and keep this Wiki up to date for

597
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,720
instance we have a lot of work coming

598
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,299
from beer from detnet from various

599
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:04,980
different things we want to coordinate

600
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,980
as as much as possible because as you

601
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,159
know we have noted problem later in this

602
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,100
thing where IDR does the same thing but

603
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,480
in a different way and we miss out

604
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,220
something in PC so we want to avoid

605
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,340
those things going forward so one of the

606
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,080
steps that we thought that we could do

607
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,779
this coordination visibility much more

608
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,720
uh much more better by using our Wiki so

609
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,940
please keep them up to date I have put

610
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,220
many documents list already but I would

611
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,919
prefer if authors do that and they have

612
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,779
the best visibility so please use this

613
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,460
so I just want to send a reminder there

614
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,260
thank you

615
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,120
and that's it

616
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,340
any last thoughts from anyone on any of

617
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,260
the working group documents otherwise

618
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,059
we'll go to the agenda

619
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,299
nope

620
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,720
Sean

621
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,000
foreign

622
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,799
it's very odd this microphone is at the

623
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,539
right height almost

624
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,200
um thank you very much

625
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:22,500
get away from everybody

626
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,080
um hey so um

627
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,880
Russ Housley and myself are writing this

628
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,140
draft

629
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,220
um in net cloth and we said hey what are

630
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,340
we going to do about TLS 1.3 and the use

631
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,220
of net cloth and it's got some dragons

632
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,980
and drove rightly noticed that maybe

633
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,020
this draft pretty much equally applied

634
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,399
here

635
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,500
so he was like hey what about this draft

636
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,140
so we pretty much said Hey how do we get

637
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,000
together and do this draft together so

638
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,500
we took the text

639
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,679
tweaked like very slightly and over here

640
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,460
so next

641
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,740
so basically the motivation is that 8253

642
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,460
defines how to protect PCP cap with TLS

643
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,640
1.2 and with 1.3 you can just say

644
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,279
something as well you can't just say

645
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,679
next version because this little tweak

646
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,760
that we've um defined called zero rtt

647
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,320
and with zero RTG there are some dragons

648
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,159
because this uh particular mode of using

649
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,020
TLS the the the the flight of messages

650
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,899
includes some

651
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:33,539
um Badness so it's replayable and you

652
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,340
have to make sure that you have you have

653
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,840
the ability to like protect against that

654
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,299
and depending on your protocol you also

655
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:43,919
don't need it so the idea that you can

656
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,720
um essentially profile a particular

657
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,580
version of the of the protocol you can

658
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,440
do that so that's what this draft is all

659
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,200
about so the idea is to basically be

660
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
explicit about the protocol

661
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,740
um profile

662
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,559
um and it's really about like mostly

663
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,220
it's like don't use this particular mode

664
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,159
um and uh you know otherwise just

665
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,320
basically be exactly like the other

666
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,500
version

667
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,500
next

668
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,039
um so early data is really simple again

669
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,080
so the idea is that like if you've

670
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,140
connected to a um uh

671
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,840
site before when the next time you talk

672
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,480
to them you don't have to worry about

673
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,620
reauthenticating you can just use this

674
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,840
this pre-shared key that's been given

675
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,700
back but if you don't do a lot of that

676
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,580
you don't need it so don't do it so if

677
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,980
you send this particular flight of

678
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,039
messages you can send it quicker but

679
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,480
don't bother if you don't need it a lot

680
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,679
so that's really what it is if you don't

681
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,500
have a lot of reconnection

682
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,080
options or you don't use it that way

683
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,820
just don't use it so because you don't

684
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,679
have to worry about it because to set it

685
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,659
up you essentially have to like do a lot

686
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,340
of Replay protection and it's not needed

687
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,020
so

688
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,020
um and the comments during the

689
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,760
discussion of the working group was

690
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
actually really interesting because Tom

691
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,899
was like hey you don't need this and he

692
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,220
said a lot of very strong things which I

693
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,659
don't agree with everything he said but

694
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,760
I was kind of like all right he's kind

695
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,960
of right

696
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,340
um at the end of the day it basically

697
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,539
said like hey if you're going to run

698
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,100
this you don't if you're going to run TS

699
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,019
1.3 you could do it you just don't need

700
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,779
it so actually we reported the comments

701
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,240
from this we're in group adoption back

702
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,980
into netcomf and the net conf working

703
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,419
group was like okay that's great well

704
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,220
let's take those words so at the end of

705
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,559
the day the drafts are actually aligned

706
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,700
already

707
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,860
and the work that's in netcomf is

708
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,760
actually going to go out for working

709
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,640
with last call very shortly so it's kind

710
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,500
of a great way that it worked out

711
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,419
and then Cypher Suite so that they're

712
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,100
slightly different

713
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,840
um in the way that you actually specify

714
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,559
The Cypher Suites you specify less which

715
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,179
is okay because the actual like

716
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,159
mandatory Implement cyber Suites went

717
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:54,360
from like

718
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,419
a long list to like four and so we

719
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,700
picked less and that's better because

720
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,080
it's

721
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,240
you know the the ones that were picked

722
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,380
by the

723
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,060
um overall uh ITF or better but there's

724
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,859
less to pick from and that's in some

725
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:12,060
respects better because that means

726
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,859
people concentrate on the ones that

727
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:17,280
you're picking and so go with those

728
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,659
and and there's there's this little

729
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,639
option about forward secure forward

730
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,560
security which people may or may not

731
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,260
care so the idea is that

732
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,020
um if the force security is that if you

733
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,359
are able to

734
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,300
capture a connection

735
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,060
or a sequence of of flights of messages

736
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,699
and then later on break it you can't

737
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,339
later go back and break it so it's good

738
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,500
that you're able to ensure that the

739
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,119
things that are that were done in the

740
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,219
future are all right so at the end of

741
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,859
the day the protocols is better it's

742
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:53,000
more provably secure

743
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,420
and that's that's next yeah so Yang

744
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,800
module I don't know if I want to hand

745
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,960
over now let's do that okay

746
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,660
just one slide since I'm the author for

747
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,980
the piece of Yang let me just explain

748
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,760
what we did here so uh basically we use

749
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,040
the netcon document which has the all

750
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,599
the groupings related to how we

751
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,140
configure TLS client and TLS server and

752
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,320
that grouping basically says we can

753
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,599
configure any version of TLs but we are

754
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,180
going to recommend that you use TLS 1.3

755
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,060
and we know that in psip there are still

756
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,920
implementations that are currently using

757
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,099
TLS 1.2 we want our Yang model to be

758
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,800
able to be used in those scenarios as

759
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,320
well and we just want to clarify in our

760
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,660
document that yes it is still possible

761
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,680
to do that you have a feature tls12 that

762
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,420
can still be enabled even though the

763
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,579
Yang model says it's not recommended but

764
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,680
that doesn't mean that it cannot be used

765
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,280
so we added this description a specific

766
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,640
section on how to use how to handle this

767
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,859
TLS version issue in our precept Yang

768
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,500
and hopefully via this update we handle

769
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,480
the comment that Tom pointed out during

770
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,640
the working group last call of young so

771
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,200
this was pretty good conversation led to

772
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,720
a new document as well as clarification

773
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,240
hopefully that would help people who are

774
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,700
implementing and using a young model in

775
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,660
future thank you

776
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,320
so I'll stand up here for like one more

777
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,520
minute while people want to ask me

778
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,259
questions and if not I'll sit down

779
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,400
thank you

780
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,180
so I don't see anyone queuing

781
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,400
so I believe that this is a

782
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,140
straightforward uh draft on this is very

783
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,599
great that it shows that already while

784
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,300
reviewing some existing PC documents so

785
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,980
it's good to catch up with the security

786
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,960
level of the ATF

787
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,619
as a result uh I'd be happy to see a

788
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:08,460
show of hands for the Abduction of the

789
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,740
document and the progress of this work

790
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,440
so if you agree on support this item

791
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,900
raise your hand if you oppose don't

792
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,599
raise your hand and ideally if you don't

793
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,160
care just

794
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,118
don't respond

795
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,099
let's give a couple of tens of seconds

796
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,780
I see a hundred percent support so far

797
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,640
which is great in any case it will be

798
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,359
resumed as I made English questions so

799
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,780
it gives yeah a great idea

800
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,700
no one opposed okay

801
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,020
so thank you for responding I think we

802
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,079
can end it right now it gives a clear

803
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,680
Trend so we will send a question to the

804
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,440
mailing list about the adoption of this

805
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,579
important document

806
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,560
thank you Sean so the next presenter is

807
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,940
who ammo

808
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,440
who's coming to the mic

809
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,460
hi everyone I'm Juan from future today

810
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,119
I'm going to talk about a pce for Miro

811
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,440
bunting next page

812
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,119
pce has been extended to distribute the

813
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,680
Sr pass

814
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,599
to network nodes

815
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,260
that Sr pass may contain bonding so

816
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,960
bonding here means The Binding sheet

817
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,079
Plus or associated with these sort of

818
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,339
seeds that list of seeds is for another

819
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,359
pass segments

820
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:59,400
contain a planting seed PC will send the

821
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,000
data bonding which is a

822
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,940
contains binding seed plus these

823
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,839
services

824
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,820
to the node

825
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:14,640
for example here we have a path from pe1

826
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,940
to P1 to node n

827
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,700
and then to node P3 P6 and then to p

828
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,480
4 so basically this is Sr pass

829
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,640
contains

830
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,320
blue segments

831
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,300
and green segments and then blue

832
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,020
segments those cool reading segments are

833
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,880
indicated by bonding which means that

834
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,880
PC we're also an abundant to know the N

835
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,400
so that binding will contain an

836
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,359
abundance seat B seed plus the city list

837
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,140
here which is S1 and S2

838
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,740
so when node n receive a package with a

839
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,940
binding seat

840
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,820
note n will replace that button sheet

841
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,359
with that list of seats which here is

842
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:09,300
node n will replace brightness seat with

843
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,280
S1 and S2 so SL1 S1 S2 determines that

844
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,460
Grim per segment so note n

845
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,420
well sit in the package along that green

846
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,720
past segment and then the package was

847
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,460
sent along the path

848
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,160
green per segment and then blue segment

849
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,119
to the destination PE 4.

850
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,800
so here

851
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,940
when a Sr pass contains abundant

852
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,359
PC we're sending to Notre n

853
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,540
so in order to provide protection

854
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,940
for the failure of lot n with the

855
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,619
binding binding seat

856
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:54,839
PC will be extended to send the funding

857
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,420
information plus

858
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,780
the load ID of load n to the adjacent

859
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,339
node of node n so with this information

860
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:08,640
the adjacent node of node n can provide

861
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,720
protection for the failure of load n

862
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,660
regarding to The Binding seat

863
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,540
so for example with Note any fails

864
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,420
node P1 will detect the failure of low

865
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,200
10

866
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,359
go to P1

867
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,200
will pop up the seat for a lot of n

868
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,880
because those rain is already gone it's

869
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,820
failed and then but for the bundling

870
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,440
seat on No 10

871
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,680
P1 will just acting as a proxy level

872
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,040
then replace that abundance sheet with

873
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,880
the list of seat for example S1 and S2

874
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,780
and then send the package along the S1

875
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,320
as S2 for example to P3 and then P3

876
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,180
version packaging along

877
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,480
the Korean paste desolation

878
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,079
here uh in the last

879
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,619
Angel Stone Research some questions

880
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,960
regarding regarding this one

881
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,099
so

882
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:11,820
so first question is that

883
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,079
so for the adjacent node

884
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,119
so that node

885
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,400
need to figure out something for example

886
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,660
if a segmentalist for example S1 S2 here

887
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,339
is adjacent is adjacent so in this case

888
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,980
because as Jason city is local

889
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,900
so P1

890
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,180
need to do something

891
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,220
so in this case

892
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,720
if

893
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,680
second list for bonding contains

894
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,540
the adjacency basically the first one

895
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,640
which we just considered a

896
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,280
we just care about the first

897
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,859
seat whether it's a adjacency

898
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:56,820
so here we assume S1 is adjacency

899
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,020
in this case P1 will figure out

900
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,640
the remote

901
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,000
note of that adjacency here

902
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,260
so

903
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,619
P1 will figure out through the adjacency

904
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,480
adjacency

905
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,280
to get the

906
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,359
the remote node ID or remote node seats

907
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:22,920
which is a p P3 and then

908
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,740
P1 well

909
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,940
replace the banding sheet with

910
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,740
the notice leader of a P3 and then for

911
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,940
the package

912
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:41,220
to P3 and then P3 will use

913
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,160
whatever is the weather is the adjacency

914
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,099
that will notice it of S2 and then send

915
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,079
the package along the path along the

916
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,220
green pass segment and enter the

917
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,940
destination so that's one question

918
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,579
raised by Angel Stone and then I just

919
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,680
answer here uh

920
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,540
do you have any questions for regarding

921
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,020
this part

922
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,740
good good

923
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,200
foreign

924
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,520
yeah so I saw your reply this morning

925
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,900
thank you for that

926
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,119
um I think I've got a few comments on

927
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,579
just the general solution so what you

928
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,680
commented on yeah totally great makes

929
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,540
sense in that situation thank you thank

930
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,420
you um I think though it creates an

931
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,760
assumption that P1 in this situation

932
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,300
actually has the capability of pushing

933
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,280
the node Sid to reach in this case for

934
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,920
example P3 as well as the remaining SIDS

935
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,420
that are in the stock being provided by

936
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,460
The Binding Sid so imagine if your

937
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,200
binding Sid is instructed with five

938
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,740
labels or five SRV six labels the

939
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,900
assumption is now P1 can do you know

940
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,640
four plus one to work around that or

941
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,920
three plus one to work around that

942
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,740
um so I I think that kind of

943
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,480
creates an implied assumption that the

944
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,040
neighboring node has the sufficient

945
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,960
Hardware capability to push all of those

946
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,400
labels of the path

947
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,260
and so I think this brings probably a

948
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,720
more fundamental question of if we're

949
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,700
trying to protect n

950
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,400
and The Binding Sid do we still want to

951
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,740
route along the complete path that the

952
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,839
Bindings that has taken or do we want to

953
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,960
rewrote where the writing set terminates

954
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,579
because you've got those label in

955
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:23,460
position on that neighboring node and so

956
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,480
it could be possible that your

957
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,680
neighboring know that you're transiting

958
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,839
through P1 in this case

959
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,700
actually can't carry all of that traffic

960
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,200
that The Binding set is providing which

961
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,579
is why The Binding sit exists in the

962
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,020
first place

963
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,300
um so it kind of leads then into I think

964
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,160
another open question of

965
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,780
or another open challenge is that the

966
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,440
assumption is P1 can resolve where

967
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,359
n is going to go right so the local

968
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,800
adjacency said

969
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,400
I agree with you if it's you know an igp

970
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,079
adjacency SID it can figure it out from

971
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,960
the igp information but if it's in a

972
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,940
different domain it can't

973
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,480
if it's a epe sid it can't

974
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,040
you know in the future there could be

975
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,560
other segment IDs where it just that

976
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,020
local P1 can't know what is the neighbor

977
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,339
Beyond

978
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:10,800
so I think it raises the question of

979
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,940
should PC actually tell P1 what see what

980
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,640
Sid or stack of Sids it should use to

981
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,160
actually protect that node Zid or sorry

982
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,839
protect that binding said

983
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,359
so for example instead of telling P1

984
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:26,400
here is a binding sit of your neighbor

985
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,200
here is the path of the binding Sid

986
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,900
instead here is The Binding Sid here is

987
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,760
a list of Sids that you shall use to

988
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,980
protect that binding Zone

989
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,020
yeah that's a good question yeah so

990
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,900
right now we assume that igpe will

991
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,180
distribute those kind of adjacency and

992
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,339
then the P1 figure out that one and so

993
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,560
you you imply that maybe pce can do

994
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,520
something if the the planting segment is

995
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,700
contain the adjacency and then PC may

996
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,240
just figure out the node seat of a P3

997
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,700
right so that notice since then notice

998
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,780
it to

999
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,960
P1 and that is P1 can make Poise work

1000
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,240
easy right is that your comments yeah

1001
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,760
and it yeah and it handles and it

1002
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,380
handles other situations especially with

1003
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,839
multi-domain or pcecc and just

1004
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:15,660
situations where P1 doesn't know where

1005
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,520
that said is going to go and and it and

1006
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,560
it opens up the door for PC to decide

1007
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,720
like as I mentioned instead of rerouting

1008
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,040
to the next node you can rewrote

1009
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,780
somewhere Downstream which can even be

1010
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,700
traffic engineered right it or other

1011
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,619
binding sets it opens up a lot more

1012
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,359
flexibility

1013
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:32,339
um and I think after reading the email

1014
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:34,140
this morning and I'm still planning to

1015
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,760
reply to it and then coming to this

1016
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,839
working group I think the solution of

1017
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:40,859
protecting the node that's carrying a

1018
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,140
binding Sid I'm worried that we might be

1019
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,700
repeating different

1020
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,160
you know descriptions in both PC and IDR

1021
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,440
and so I'm wondering if the solution

1022
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,300
should be taken out into let's say

1023
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,000
routing working group or even spring

1024
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,740
and then worry about the encoding after

1025
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,420
the fact because the encoding between

1026
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,220
bgp and P sub is going to be very

1027
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,319
similar situations it's just how do you

1028
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,359
actually want to solve the problem

1029
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,339
and I think in our discussions right now

1030
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:06,599
I think there's a few different ways to

1031
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:08,400
solve it and I think there needs to be

1032
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,380
some consistency on how we want to solve

1033
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,079
it yeah in fact that this is a

1034
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,400
we have a protection drop in Spring

1035
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,300
and then child suppose uh I think

1036
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,140
in order to provide protection for node

1037
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,720
failure responding seat and then we need

1038
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,859
a

1039
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:32,940
PC or igp IDR extension that's why we

1040
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,839
come here we already have a draft for

1041
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,119
protecting the planting seed in Spring

1042
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,280
group okay and then we need and then we

1043
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,980
did a support from the other

1044
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,800
a political extensions okay such as pce

1045
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,599
I might have missed that I'll take a

1046
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,579
look for that but uh I think

1047
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:52,920
clarifying exactly how we want to

1048
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,839
protect it and then deal with the

1049
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:56,160
encodings after

1050
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,619
because there's some weird quirks here

1051
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,260
especially when you start talking about

1052
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,700
multi-area multi-domain different types

1053
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,980
of Sids if if it was just node SIDS in

1054
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,079
the stock and if P1 had enough Hardware

1055
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,880
capacity that's not a big deal but

1056
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,079
unfortunately that's not the reality

1057
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,260
sometimes so anyways thank you

1058
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,180
yeah thank you for your for your comment

1059
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,800
on the suggestions

1060
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,099
I think this is for the SS Angel

1061
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:23,760
mentioned that this is so for the node n

1062
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,460
is which in the domain is easy

1063
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,560
so if that note n

1064
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,020
is a border node

1065
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,359
yeah that case is even tougher because

1066
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,800
border node

1067
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,660
and then

1068
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,240
the previous over the uptrend node do

1069
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,339
not know

1070
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:47,099
the past segment because that uh domain

1071
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:49,859
so in in that case

1072
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:53,460
so we needed to have equals production

1073
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:58,020
because that no 10 is an eagerness node

1074
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,579
so we need to have a backup equals node

1075
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:05,099
to be assigned to protected node end and

1076
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:08,420
then we have those kind of a

1077
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,920
that's the requirement you you said

1078
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,359
question so if node N is a border node

1079
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,400
and then the board node we have a backup

1080
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,560
border node and then in that case and

1081
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,880
then backup buttoners know the

1082
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,920
information about another domain with

1083
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,480
same information as another n

1084
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,500
um I think it's probably debatable

1085
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,240
whether or not it's considered an egress

1086
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,040
node because it's still an end-to-end

1087
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,220
tunnel and The Binding Sid is still part

1088
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,619
of that end-to-end packet that n10 path

1089
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:39,060
there's no de-encapsulation at that

1090
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:39,839
point

1091
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:40,920
so

1092
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,020
at that point when it's leaving you know

1093
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,240
a domain it's still part of that tunnel

1094
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,680
so it's not necessarily egressing the

1095
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,780
tunnel it's just egressing the domain or

1096
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,579
the forwarding instructions where

1097
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,800
the control plane in that domain has a

1098
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,420
view and perspective of what's beyond

1099
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,420
but it's still in the same tunnel so I

1100
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,760
think the egress protection is more

1101
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,180
applicable onto egressing of a tunnel

1102
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,680
man yeah you're right you're right yeah

1103
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,300
the technology is another yet because

1104
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,640
these are final touches Nation this is

1105
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,099
the Border note yeah more personality

1106
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:13,579
you're right

1107
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,559
the next page so here is the extension

1108
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,960
to species

1109
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,900
first we have a need to

1110
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,780
have a new capability so this capability

1111
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,640
is for distributed binding information

1112
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,079
for protection

1113
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:34,140
basically in the

1114
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,880
past setup

1115
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,599
type capability we need to need to

1116
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,700
include a new

1117
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,300
PSD type for distributed funding for

1118
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,059
protection and then we may have a

1119
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,460
special TRV

1120
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,240
which contains the parameters

1121
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,220
so if we have a PCC then we just Define

1122
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,980
new new beat which is B beat

1123
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,800
that's a b bit indicate

1124
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,280
the capability for

1125
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,920
distributed bonding for protection

1126
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,760
next page

1127
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:18,059
for distributed bonding to the adjacent

1128
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:19,440
node

1129
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,540
so because this is not a really funding

1130
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,359
so we need to have indications

1131
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:27,780
to indicate that this is just for

1132
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,700
funding protection

1133
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,359
so here we have extensions to RP and the

1134
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,800
SRP object

1135
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,079
so in this object

1136
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:42,180
we have a percent of POV so this is tlv

1137
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,880
will contain a new

1138
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,980
password

1139
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,059
PhD type

1140
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:50,280
which indicate that this is just for

1141
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,559
distributed abundant for protection

1142
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,040
in addition to that because we also need

1143
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,980
the ID of that that post will fail the

1144
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,260
node so we just have us

1145
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,140
TRV contain the ID

1146
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,599
of that possible failure

1147
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,640
so next page

1148
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,800
I think that's all and then we would

1149
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,339
like to uh have a comment from all of

1150
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:16,520
you

1151
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,280
let me put myself

1152
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,660
uh one comment as a contributor uh

1153
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,059
especially I think I agree with a lot of

1154
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,040
things that Andrew mentioned so I think

1155
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,920
we need to take at least the core of the

1156
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,680
work in spring or in rtgwg where we

1157
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,079
describe how this thing process needs to

1158
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,540
work and there are various options as

1159
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,300
well like should we only node IDs needed

1160
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,520
do we need destination do we need path

1161
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,160
do we need uh what we are protecting

1162
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,559
what all the information that we need to

1163
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,900
exchange from a PC or from IDR point of

1164
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,300
view that we need a little bit more

1165
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,819
clarification on that and then once we

1166
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,700
come to the extension uh that work of

1167
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,319
course will belong in the PC working

1168
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,359
group and even with the extension part

1169
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:08,579
uh we can debate on what will be the

1170
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,280
best way to encode this information but

1171
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,440
that is premature because we don't

1172
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,760
really know right now what all

1173
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,500
information it is if it is just node ID

1174
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,260
maybe what you have makes sense but if

1175
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,720
we also put paths and all so what you're

1176
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,300
currently the encoding by adding this

1177
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,000
tlv and RP may not make much sense so I

1178
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,640
think let's postpone that discussion and

1179
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,119
first focus on at a higher level what

1180
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,700
all information that we need to pass to

1181
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,558
make this mirror binding work

1182
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,220
John

1183
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,859
John Scudder um actually I think all I

1184
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:48,960
really want to say is plus one

1185
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,619
um

1186
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:53,099
please do the work once in a group that

1187
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:55,619
has the uh the core expertise to get the

1188
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:56,940
architecture right and then it'll be

1189
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,800
really easy to do the rest of it here

1190
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,800
after that's done thank you

1191
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,200
Sean thank you

1192
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,720
okay thank you everyone thanks thank you

1193
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,078
Emma

1194
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,700
next

1195
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,920
next presenter is

1196
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,640
Giuseppe

1197
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:20,640
about iFit to Transmission in the

1198
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,598
working group introduction

1199
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,579
hello everybody this is an update about

1200
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:29,040
this draft that has been adopted

1201
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,619
just last ATF so

1202
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,900
next slide I'm present I'm Joseph I'm

1203
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,000
presenting on behalf of the co-authors

1204
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,180
so yeah few words about the background

1205
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,660
and motivation so with iFit with the

1206
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,720
notes the data plane on path Telemetry

1207
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,780
in particular in c2im that is defined in

1208
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,800
the RFC 9197 and Alternate marking

1209
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,579
that which the standard track documents

1210
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:00,059
are in NFC area editor 2 the 8321 bits

1211
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:03,359
and 8889bs so let's say the data plane

1212
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:07,980
methodology are stable so here we want

1213
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,859
to define the psap extension to

1214
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:13,559
distribute paths carrying iFit

1215
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:16,740
information so a PCC can indicate which

1216
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,700
I fit features it supports and the PCA

1217
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:24,300
can configure the specific behavior

1218
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,720
at the PCC so the effect attributes can

1219
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,819
be generalized and include as tlv

1220
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:33,599
carried in the ls in the lspa object so

1221
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,520
next slide

1222
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,400
so the draft defined two tlvs basically

1223
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,980
the capability advertisement tlv and the

1224
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:45,119
attributes tlv the capability tlv

1225
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,839
is an optional tlb in the open object

1226
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:51,780
for the capability advertisement of psap

1227
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,859
so we find we Define Five Flags

1228
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:58,680
according to the RFC 9197 and the

1229
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,520
alternate marking uh in addition uh we

1230
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,800
Define also the attributes dlv that

1231
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,559
provide the configurable option for the

1232
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:10,980
features for the fit feature and it can

1233
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,020
be included as an optional tlb in the

1234
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,180
lspa object as I also mentioned before

1235
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,760
and so the five sub tlbs that are

1236
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,200
defined are the four tlv for nc2m and

1237
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,300
one for alternate marking

1238
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,339
more details of course are within the

1239
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:28,980
draft time I missed here the details

1240
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,200
because we already presented last time

1241
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,720
so next slide

1242
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,599
yeah I just this is maybe the last slide

1243
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,520
I just want to summarize the changes

1244
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,619
from the zero zero version because we

1245
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:43,619
had some comments uh after the adoption

1246
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:46,200
and during the adoption so we we

1247
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,859
addressed this comment uh we clap mainly

1248
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:52,380
we clarify that the head end needs

1249
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,599
support the if it capability and it is

1250
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,880
supposed that at least two nodes

1251
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,420
on the path support uh the fit

1252
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,940
capability we also clarified that the

1253
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,839
fit methods are more mature for srv6

1254
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,740
compared to SRM apls in fact

1255
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:14,780
in in the implementation of

1256
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,839
uh bought in c2im and Alternate marking

1257
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:21,119
for mpls are still under discussion with

1258
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,000
so uh there was a comment to remove all

1259
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,640
the references to this draft that are

1260
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,760
not stable so we only uh keep the

1261
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,300
references for the srb6 implementation

1262
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,079
that are uh the the references are quite

1263
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:39,540
stable for example the application for

1264
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,319
alternate marking is again in RFC editor

1265
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:46,680
queue and also the the eom extension for

1266
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,260
a pv6 is in isg review so we can say

1267
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:52,140
that this methodology are stable then we

1268
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,240
also clarify the relation with the IDR

1269
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,200
draft

1270
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,859
uh you know that bot psap and bgp can be

1271
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:01,140
used to instantiate Sr policy so it is

1272
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,180
reasonable to have the same mechanism

1273
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,720
for both psap and bgp so we are also

1274
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,020
trying to keep the two drafts aligned uh

1275
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,020
and we also clarify the methodology with

1276
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,880
regard to the framework

1277
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,460
and then we had also added additional

1278
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,859
editorial comments so next slide

1279
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,490
yeah

1280
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:23,700
[Music]

1281
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,200
um

1282
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,140
we found let's say this is a document

1283
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:31,140
relevant to enable bottom and Alternate

1284
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,140
marking control mechanism of course we

1285
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,240
always welcome question and comments to

1286
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,000
improve the document and to keep aligned

1287
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,359
with other work thank you

1288
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:44,460
secrets

1289
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,559
any question from the group for Tuesday

1290
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,920
pay

1291
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,319
no no

1292
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,900
thank you Elizabeth okay thanks for the

1293
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,240
follow-up

1294
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,380
so the next presentation is for

1295
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,780
uh control identifier space

1296
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:06,420
by Han

1297
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,119
okay

1298
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:10,799
I've given okay you should be able to

1299
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,380
okay hello everyone my name is Hunter

1300
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,500
and I'm going to talk about the psap

1301
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,319
controlled ID space an extension to the

1302
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:21,680
PC

1303
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:25,799
yeah uh as we all know we use pce to

1304
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:27,859
allocate the

1305
01:00:27,859 --> 01:00:33,839
srmps enable and the srv6 seat but this

1306
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,420
route assume the naval and ID range to

1307
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,420
be used by the VC is normal and set on

1308
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,359
both PC peers

1309
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,640
so our document specified the intention

1310
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,579
to support the advertisement of the IDS

1311
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:51,500
base to the PC to control

1312
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,380
yeah uh basic news it drops is very

1313
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,920
simple to to delegate in the ID space

1314
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,400
the ID space TRV is included in the open

1315
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,299
message and the etlv corresponding to

1316
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:08,700
each ID type should be included only

1317
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,900
once in the open message if it appeared

1318
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,700
more times only the first one will be

1319
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,359
used and we Define two kinds of ID

1320
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:21,240
controls with TRV the first one is for

1321
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,180
srmps enables it's called enable control

1322
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,799
space and the second one is for SRA 6 C

1323
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,559
functional ID space is called the

1324
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:34,880
functional ID control space

1325
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,500
yeah the the first one is the naval

1326
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,500
controls with TRV it contains the

1327
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,839
following Fields the first field is the

1328
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:46,020
number of the ID blocks and the flags is

1329
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:50,480
zero and follow the apply the

1330
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,460
various the enable range

1331
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,220
and for the srv6 function ID control

1332
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:02,819
space TRV we also have the following

1333
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:05,040
structure and

1334
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,099
the first is the number of ID blocks

1335
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,520
and the flags there is a one bit is

1336
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,579
indicated if the location and locator

1337
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:16,980
field is included

1338
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:20,520
and followed by the C structure to

1339
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,760
describe the the structure of the seed

1340
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,400
the the same structure is shown in the

1341
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,059
next side it's including the the Nokia

1342
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:32,940
tournaments the functions and arguments

1343
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:39,059
and then we have uh see the range and if

1344
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:42,299
the air bit in the flag is that the

1345
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:45,660
locator will included if the lbs is not

1346
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,660
set that means the the seed function

1347
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:53,359
range is applied to all locator

1348
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,020
and basically it says it's a

1349
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,400
Samsung update from the NASA

1350
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,700
presentation we expanded the sra6 pass

1351
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,540
ID to various function ID and we add the

1352
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:10,319
C structure to describe the the seed and

1353
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,240
we add the block of field for better

1354
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,440
expensibility then add me as a new new

1355
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,280
co-author so we are I always we think

1356
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,140
the content is stable so we are asking

1357
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,540
for the working group adoption opposite

1358
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,720
draft

1359
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,119
the document is already in the working

1360
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:38,040
group adoption queue based on the past

1361
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,680
then thanks for keeping it up to date is

1362
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,420
there any concerns from anyone on this

1363
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,619
document any comments

1364
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,880
chank go ahead are you in the room

1365
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,819
foreign

1366
01:03:52,819 --> 01:03:55,500
so thank you for putting presentation

1367
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,740
it's really clear and as a course I

1368
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:01,920
think URI the the content is stable so

1369
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,839
we should ask for working for adoption

1370
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,299
and thank you for all guys for listening

1371
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:08,780
thank you

1372
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:23,040
same presenter for the new one

1373
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,619
you know same same

1374
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:28,400
somehow

1375
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:34,040
change

1376
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,520
able let me do it just wait a second

1377
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,400
and then I'll give you control

1378
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,140
share

1379
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:47,058
and then let me pass control

1380
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,059
now you should be able to control okay

1381
01:04:50,059 --> 01:04:53,099
so my second draft is about a pce

1382
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:56,700
initiated IP IB terminal

1383
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,579
yeah basically the motivation is that in

1384
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:01,700
the sty use case

1385
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,700
ipturnal is needed to Traverse the one

1386
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,940
and pce can use as a control protocol to

1387
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,000
initiate this IP terminal

1388
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,280
and this is also a simple draft

1389
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,760
basically you need to divide advertise

1390
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,319
the the hypertonal compatibility and to

1391
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:25,079
set up maintain and tear down the IP

1392
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:27,299
kernels initiated by the pce

1393
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,180
uh since this is only the first draft we

1394
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,859
do not include the internal stage

1395
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:35,339
synchronization and various timeout

1396
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:37,799
process session final process in the in

1397
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:40,460
this draft

1398
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,799
yeah uh the PC initial internal

1399
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:46,740
capability TR we designed as follows

1400
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:51,380
yeah uh there is a 32-bit Channel type

1401
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:56,099
if a PCC can support this kind of Kernel

1402
01:05:56,099 --> 01:06:00,540
One beta is set we pick the we pick the

1403
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,579
mostly used terminal in the in the right

1404
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:04,380
table

1405
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:06,559
foreign

1406
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,480
with design the following message the

1407
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,540
first one is the PC internally initiate

1408
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,720
message to initiate alternator tunnel PC

1409
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,079
is sent to the PCC and there is a flag

1410
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,319
that we indicate if it's initiate what

1411
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:26,160
it did

1412
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,319
and the second one is the PC terminal

1413
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,020
update message to modify the parameter

1414
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,780
of the kernel it's also sent by the pce

1415
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,960
to PCC and the third one is this

1416
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,079
internal report message is for the PCC

1417
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,660
to report the state of the terminal to

1418
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:43,859
the pce

1419
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:46,799
and this message compromise the SRP

1420
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:47,960
object

1421
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,700
it contains the ID to coordinate it

1422
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:54,420
between the initiate and Report or the

1423
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:58,619
PC error message under Arsenal indicates

1424
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:00,440
that in

1425
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,720
initialization origination and the

1426
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:08,058
message also contains Eternal objects

1427
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:10,319
yeah for the kernel object there is many

1428
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:12,359
some TRV

1429
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:15,299
for the first one is the internal ID TRV

1430
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:17,160
contains the source stress that

1431
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,500
designation dress internal type internal

1432
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,200
ID and the second one is the internal

1433
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,780
name TRV and the third one is the

1434
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:27,059
internal parameter it depends on the

1435
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:29,700
ternal type we reuse the tunnel

1436
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,299
parameter from the bgp Eternal type so

1437
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,700
it's basically in the same format and

1438
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,460
the terminal attribute TRV contains the

1439
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,280
metric or the T metric The Matrix is

1440
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,299
used as a kind of the T metric used as

1441
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:47,579
the the requirement and the metric is

1442
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:48,619
used

1443
01:07:48,619 --> 01:07:52,460
for the for the report

1444
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,880
yeah since this is only the the first uh

1445
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,760
basically the first round we would like

1446
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,700
to solicitate the feedback on this route

1447
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,460
for example which type of alternative

1448
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,640
support in this uh in this kind of five

1449
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,720
internal we currently use this DGP

1450
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,720
tunnel

1451
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,759
registry but is the first comprocessor

1452
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,299
registry or we can pick the mostly used

1453
01:08:20,299 --> 01:08:23,120
and do we need to add the thermostat

1454
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,520
synchronization in the in in the in the

1455
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,359
future

1456
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,359
yeah that's all

1457
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:33,380
any comments

1458
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,439
Andrew

1459
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,560
I um I guess the root question I have is

1460
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,660
why use piece up for this if there's no

1461
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,679
path to compute

1462
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,920
you can sing called The Eternal as some

1463
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,380
kind of the past you Traverse the one

1464
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:58,819
because there will be multiple choice

1465
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:00,899
but I mean like couldn't you just use

1466
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:03,120
netconf to provision this or just SNMP

1467
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,859
or just any one of the flavors of

1468
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:07,679
mediation protocols yeah it's possible

1469
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,100
but we can also use pce to do that right

1470
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,899
I guess I just see what is the benefit

1471
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,179
of using psup to do it compared to

1472
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:17,520
something just you can program anything

1473
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,640
with netcon for example so it just seems

1474
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,160
like a lot of defining to be done for

1475
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,479
just essentially at the end of the day

1476
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:26,219
just basic configuration because you're

1477
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:27,779
not doing make before break path

1478
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:29,759
calculations you're not doing state

1479
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,560
tracking in order to react to those

1480
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,439
States information so it just

1481
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:36,839
it just feels heavy to me yeah when you

1482
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,238
create a tunnel you can attach your team

1483
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:41,580
metric to request that you create a

1484
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,279
certain

1485
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,080
internal correct bounding to this T

1486
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,839
metric there's kind of the use case so

1487
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:50,339
okay maybe I'll have to go back here

1488
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:52,799
thanks

1489
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:55,260
okay then go ahead

1490
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:58,679
so I think it can it removed yourself

1491
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:01,800
from the queue I think Robin

1492
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,340
foreign

1493
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,540
years ago because but later we found

1494
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:16,140
that we found identify this the new user

1495
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,800
cases that use the ip800 to transfer

1496
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,940
this the network for example in the sd-1

1497
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:28,440
use cases because maybe that's used to

1498
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,320
utilize this IP tunnel to Traverse this

1499
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,560
underlying Network so that we need to

1500
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,260
initiate this IP tunnel by the

1501
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,440
controller so we think use the pce that

1502
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,020
is has achieved this better

1503
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:46,860
sustainability and performance so we we

1504
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,380
start this work and the comments will

1505
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,100
come okay

1506
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:55,699
okay then go ahead

1507
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,820
as for the presentation uh in the

1508
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,520
introduction section of the draft uh the

1509
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,100
the use case or what is uh what is

1510
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,679
mentioned there is that this tunnels

1511
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,159
help in uh addressing the label stack

1512
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:15,900
depth issue MSD issue uh uh I mean it's

1513
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,580
different from what was presented today

1514
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,760
and my question is uh uh how does it

1515
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,800
help there and is that really the use

1516
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,239
case

1517
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:27,540
yeah there's also another use case but

1518
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:30,659
we think that C1 is more relevant now

1519
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:33,000
you know

1520
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,640
okay so what I would suggest is uh if

1521
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,159
you could uh kind of put some more text

1522
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:40,800
to explain or Justify those use case and

1523
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,260
how these things would uh help there uh

1524
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,880
that would be helpful

1525
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,960
I I concur with what Andrew mentioned uh

1526
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,060
so we need to probably help understand

1527
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,360
uh if this is really needed or a right

1528
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,900
way to go about it thank you okay

1529
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:00,139
foreign

1530
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:07,620
thanks for the kittens suggestion in

1531
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:10,260
fact we had this another draft used to

1532
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,659
talk about this the application

1533
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:15,420
scenarios and free work of this tunnel

1534
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:18,360
segment so later we send this in the

1535
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,000
main list for references so here are

1536
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,520
there so we can discuss more about this

1537
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,600
possible use cases

1538
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:32,719
foreign any other comments

1539
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,940
let me have myself in the queue then uh

1540
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:38,640
thanks for uh thanks for your comment

1541
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,780
but uh I think the motivation is needed

1542
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,940
in the draft itself we need to clearly

1543
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,920
specify why we need this functionality

1544
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,440
and not just because why we need IP

1545
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,719
tunnels that part is clear basically but

1546
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:55,140
why we need to use psip as the interface

1547
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:57,480
for that IP tunnel and that we need a

1548
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,600
Clarity uh before we progress this then

1549
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,880
when it comes to encoding again we have

1550
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,460
to make a choice is do we want to go

1551
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,980
through new messages for this or we have

1552
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,960
path setup type we already allow path

1553
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,260
setup type to handle srv6 which is sort

1554
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,320
of an IP tunnel in a way so do we need a

1555
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,659
brand new set of messages to go or

1556
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:20,640
should we use our existing Machinery

1557
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,699
that already exists in psap if we want

1558
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,679
to continue with that work but first

1559
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,360
thing is like I think we need consensus

1560
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,900
on whether we have enough motivation in

1561
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,480
this working group to do ipt tunnel wire

1562
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,520
reset that would be my comment but thank

1563
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,060
you for your work

1564
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:41,460
anybody else this was our last

1565
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,440
presentation anybody else any other

1566
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,678
business

1567
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:50,239
I think you should close

1568
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,520
so we've reached the end of our pch in

1569
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,679
there for today so to see the end of the

1570
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,360
ITF week

1571
