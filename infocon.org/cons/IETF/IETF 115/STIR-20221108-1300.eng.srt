3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,300
we'll get to the flags are running off

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,080
well the research

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,119
normally like a little

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,239
plugged into

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,860
it oh it snaps for Sean that would maybe

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,160
help right

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,840
right well we'll just run it

10
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,039
though oh my gosh that's why

11
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,180

uh document status

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,720
um

59
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,280
basically a whole bunch of these

60
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,920
documents are are moving along pretty

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,820
pretty rapidly we just saw the three

62
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,940
documents in this first category appear

63
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,979
on the isg email

64
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,699
um agenda for the first of December so

65
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,800
they're moving along

66
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,479
quickly

67
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,639
the ones here in group two are the um

68
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,060
uh the provider oob we've been waiting

69
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,720
uh for an update to this uh we agreed

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,139
that once Dash O3 was posted we do a

71
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,759
working group last call but we haven't

72
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,380
seen O3 since uh April

73
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,479
what just happened all right then we

74
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,520
will start that

75
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,979
um

76
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,919
okay so complete shift in the last uh

77
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,000
day about who's got the token and ocsp

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,460
new draft on stapling the question is is

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,139
this ready for adoption we'll be talking

80
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,440
about that

81
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,300
so there's a

82
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,000
the agenda is we'll be going through

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,720
um

84
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,960
I I believe these first three documents

85
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,840
will be very quick in terms of since

86
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,419
they were just all updated some status

87
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,039
information but they're on the isg

88
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,020
agenda as we we said

89
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,020
uh next slide and then

90
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,620
um

91
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,639
the ones that are basically in work and

92
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,440
so we have ones that we're trying to

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,720
decide whether we should adopt or just

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,380
move forward or where we are on those

95
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,060
are there any agenda bashes

96
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,199
okay then

97
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,900
let's start with the the status of those

98
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,800
uh three documents that are on the isg

99
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,600
agendas or anything for us to talk about

100
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,860
yep Chris

101
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,180
so um next slide I I we can talk about

102
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,060
these I just tried to use this as an

103
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,940
opportunity to go through all the diffs

104
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,560
that have happened over the various

105
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,419
reviews

106
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,479
um there is a few

107
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,319
um minor normative things as I note on

108
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,660
the fifth bullet item

109
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,180
um I can quickly go through them

110
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,740
uh if you prefer so uh first one

111
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,500
um I clarified some of the rules of

112
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,800
inclusion of URI references

113
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,300
um really it's only for jcd and JCL keys

114
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,639
um I did include normative language as

115
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
was suggested with uh

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,900
um

117
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,139
the review comments

118
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,500
I moved the clarification of using

119
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,419
double quoted strings

120
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,900
which was explicitly noted in the name

121
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,020
and APN section to the parent section

122
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,060
because it really applies more generally

123
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,660
to how we calculate digest for Strings

124
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,400
more generally so

125
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,960
that was also based on a comment uh

126
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,840
uh as Jack pointed out on the mailing

127
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,360
list some of the examples had the wrong

128
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,199
double quotes which was causing issues

129
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,560
when generating the uh the digest so

130
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,440
uh did fix that which was a good catch

131
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,740
um for

132
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,720
yeah this was

133
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,900
um a somewhat major

134
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,780
organizational change but not not

135
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,599
changing meaning so uh

136
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,060
I prefaced each of these sections

137
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,300
approaching it from mode 3 and mode four

138
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,460
uh where you were using rcd claims and

139
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,699
rcd and rcdi claims uh

140
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,520
uh for details on using claims

141
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,780
constraints

142
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,160
I

143
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,500
changed that I think to be less

144
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,379
confusing where the first section is

145
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,199
specific to the usage of claim

146
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,620
constraints for rcd specifically

147
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,680
and then the second section adds when

148
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,219
you use rcdi with rcd

149
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,059
um

150
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,319
so hopefully that makes sense

151
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,599
um

152
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,180
yeah there was a minor

153
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,480
normative suggestion there to to I

154
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,480
literally capitalized the most in maze

155
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,640
in those sentences so hopefully that

156
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,080
doesn't change much there

157
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,600
uh there was some confusion over compact

158
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,260
form as there generally is uh uh for

159
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,300
most documents so I added a little more

160
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,360
background and pointers to definitions

161
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,580
uh and sections and documents that were

162
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,420
relevant for that

163
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,940
um

164
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,899
yeah the the further information

165
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,060
associated with callers it was sort of

166
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,100
in an awkward place in the document sort

167
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,380
of like in the middle even though it

168
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,260
talks about future things and and those

169
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,600
types of things so I actually moved it

170
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,200
to the last section just uh I didn't

171
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
alter it I just moved it essentially

172
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,380
next page

173
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,519
um

174
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,339
yeah so for the

175
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,440
sip specific sections we have

176
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,240
verification and authentication

177
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,779
procedures sections that are General to

178
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,660
rcd passport usage and then we had

179
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,899
sections that are specific to sip

180
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,940
authentication Service and verification

181
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,279
so

182
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,279
um there was some overlaps

183
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,440
in some of the descriptions there so I

184
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
tried to clean that up

185
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,760
and uh I took

186
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,160
two paragraphs that were in the

187
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,399
zip specific sections and made a new

188
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,200
section called verification using

189
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,279
third-party rcd

190
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,779
um to remove those from the Sip specific

191
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,420
sessions sections and then cleaned up

192
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,420
the specific sections to to refer

193
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,160
essentially to like

194
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,980
rules about

195
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,339
what you do compare comparisons with uh

196
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,620
sip header fields and and things like

197
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,880
that

198
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,920
and compact form

199
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
Etc

200
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,260
and then finally uh

201
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,200
in the Ayana request I uh I labeled the

202
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,300
Ayana registry as passport rcd types

203
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,040
there was a comment about what his types

204
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,120
mean

205
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,839
um

206
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,660
so my simple fix was for that was

207
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,600
actually to make it more specific to

208
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,660
passport rcd claim types which hopefully

209
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,000
clarifies that

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,560
um

211
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,839
types is a word that we use in other

212
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,300
registries already as well so

213
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,220
I didn't think that was too much of an

214
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,459
issue but uh I think the

215
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,640
I did realize rcd claim was a better

216
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,560
clarification for the for that specific

217
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,959
registry

218
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,420
and that that's all that I could find

219
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,480
that was Major everything else was

220
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,079
mostly editorial

221
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,079
any questions about any of these changes

222
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,860
okay I'm actually in cutie

223
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,200
so uh pretend I'm from the floor this

224
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
has been

225
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,860
um the one question I have and I know

226
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,600
the answer to this but I just wanted to

227
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,160
make sure we mentioned it explicitly

228
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,339
there was some commentary over coming up

229
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,040
with some explicit way to tag for rcdi

230
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,019
when you were looking at a

231
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,820
uh hashing the field itself versus

232
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,519
dereferencing the field for the hash

233
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,899
and I think the answer is we're not

234
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,920
going to act on that right

235
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,899
that was in the art art

236
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,120
um do you reference say that so there

237
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,399
was a comment uh I can't think of his

238
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,800
name Martin no

239
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,560
no it was the art art review I think it

240
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,959
was on your first slide it was the top

241
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,800
one wasn't it okay hang on

242
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,660
yeah

243
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,000
yeah the URI reference recursion rules

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,459
for jcd but the idea of putting in any

245
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,220
kind of actual syntactic sugar to say

246
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,740
this is this is a reference versus a uh

247
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,079
oh yeah yeah we're not acting on that

248
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,940
point right yeah the potential

249
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,459
suggestion of adding uh another slash or

250
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,560
something

251
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,660
yeah I tried to clarify that in the

252
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,959
document and and in my response

253
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,540
um to the review comment which is you

254
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,940
know there's only one potential

255
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,200
uh JCL is the only one that reference uh

256
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,000
does two URI references uh everything

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,279
else is a single URI reference

258
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,180
or we can only have one level of

259
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,880
recursion right exactly

260
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,959
okay I mean this this you know has been

261
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,680
sticky in our CD for a long time

262
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,880
and I you know

263
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
I mean I I think I think I personally

264
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,560
felt like we never got closure on the

265
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,940
threat model that we were actually

266
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,880
trying to beat with some of this but I'm

267
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,240
willing to gloss over this at this point

268
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,440
because honestly I think it is so

269
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,779
complicated no one will ever use it

270
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,060
and this this text will be inert in the

271
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,640
document

272
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,639
[Music]

273
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,820
foreign

274
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,420
I read the comment I'm like okay we can

275
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,339
we can put some things in here that like

276
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,260
tried it but I think it's you know it's

277
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,760
a pointless exercise because I think

278
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,139
this is so complicated that now we'll

279
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,620
never use it

280
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,760
so I think we've seen here there's a

281
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,220
number of minor primarily clarification

282
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,160
and organizational type changes some of

283
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,959
them are a little bit normative

284
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,839
and I don't see anyone jumping up

285
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,240
objecting to any of them remember this

286
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,139
is on the uh telechat for December 1st

287
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,540
and if we haven't seen any objections

288
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,040
you know in the next few days for this

289
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,180
we're going to assume that everyone's

290
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,719
happy with it

291
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,339
yeah I'm just saying I'm really looking

292
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,660
forward to what Roman has to say about

293
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,199
this yeah

294
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,899
because I mean that we may be forced to

295
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,160
clarify what the threat model is at that

296
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,300
point what we actually think this

297
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,100
accomplishes yeah I think it's going to

298
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,660
be an interesting telechat and there's

299
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,519
going to be education on both sides

300
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,360
laughs

301
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,560
okay

302
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,060
oh I gotta get back to the next one so

303
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,320
uh I could unshare that I'm stuck

304
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,040
here again

305
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,699
what's next identity header

306
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,620
here either one yeah okay

307
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,079
yeah this one uh is much simpler

308
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,800
um next slide

309
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,880
um

310
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,740
so a couple of the changes actually

311
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,040
there's been a lot of revisions but uh

312
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,199
some of them are just uh very

313
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,779
incremental revisions

314
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,839
um

315
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,380
so again provide got some comments about

316
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,740
the introduction and providing more you

317
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,779
know background on this third problem

318
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,320
and definitions of as and vs so I

319
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,839
included much more background they are

320
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,120
on pointer to rfcs and things like that

321
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,240
um

322
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,220
the one thing we already

323
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,260
talked about

324
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,720
um but I wanted to explicitly include we

325
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,399
talked about it on the list

326
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,800
but I want to explicitly included here

327
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,260
was clarifying the

328
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,300
statement that we added around

329
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,940
provisional sip response message

330
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,000
or that it's the or final response

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,899
message

332
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,959
that I think was the the discussion

333
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,759
point

334
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,959
um

335
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,000
that was based on comments that we got

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
from 3gpp actually

337
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,500
so just added that it was actually to

338
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,060
make it more consistent with a different

339
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,220
section in the document so

340
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,160
not really a change there but uh I just

341
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,920
wanted to mention that

342
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,839
um

343
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,419
Murray suggested changing shoulds the

344
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,040
most I think the reason that it was

345
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,359
should's

346
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,520
is because

347
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,319
um

348
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,359
we weren't sure if this was something

349
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,119
people would adopt or not but I think

350
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,220
for the purpose of this document must is

351
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,339
uh appropriate

352
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,400
um so I probably that that if out of all

353
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,900
the changes that's probably the one to

354
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,020
maybe note uh the most

355
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,139
um

356
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,559
um

357
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,480
yeah I got a comment about clarifying

358
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,340
that I you should only have a single

359
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,500
reason header corresponding to a single

360
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,240
error I think that's pretty

361
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,940
straightforward

362
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,120
uh clarifying using stir cause codes

363
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,940
only for stir to find errors which again

364
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,080
is uh what we intended

365
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,700
and then the other changes were

366
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,039
editorial

367
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,480
so I don't know if there's any

368
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,000
discussion on should versus must which I

369
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,860
think is probably the

370
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,679
the only one thing that uh

371
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,600
is of note in the changes

372
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,360
otherwise I think it's pretty good

373
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,280
all right so I think the next thing we

374
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,080
had the agenda with messages and we

375
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,340
don't have any slides for that is there

376
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,240
anything to say about it

377
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,700
nope uh so I mean so last call completed

378
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,760
there were I I all all the Art reviews

379
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,400
are late uh except for

380
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,620
um art art actually came in that was

381
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,919
from uh Claude and like uh Claudio it

382
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,419
was fine there's nothing there's

383
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,580
non-blocking midi stuff so

384
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,140
I mean when the other reviews come in

385
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,940
there may be other issues but it looks

386
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,260
to me from what we've seen so far from

387
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,760
last call that's clean

388
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,740
and if I recall the last call what we

389
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,179
had is this strictly editorial wouldn't

390
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,020
it yeah yeah

391
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,340
so again on the telechat for uh December

392
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,260
1st that we might get some reviews at

393
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,480
droplet which could change things but

394
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,020
probably not

395
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,340
so what's next

396
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,679
so the next would be connected identity

397
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,760
let me find the slides

398
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,520
okay the mask needs to come off of this

399
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,700
one

400
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,720
because I'm I'm going to be taking you

401
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,520
on a little bit of a rabbit hole of a

402
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,918
wild ride here so uh be prepared

403
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,179
right so where did this start with so

404
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,760
way back in the day after RFC 4474 was

405
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,260
released a guy by the name of John

406
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,780
Elwell who worked for Siemens then gotta

407
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,179
be in his Bonnet we had to solve this

408
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,940
problem of connected identity and partly

409
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,440
this is because you know the way that

410
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
4474 was originally designed the

411
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,820
identity header could only be used in

412
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,919
requests some very good reasons for that

413
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,940
I'm going to talk about some of those

414
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,740
good reasons in a moment

415
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,299
um so he wrote this draft that

416
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,620
introduced a new Option tag that's

417
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,539
called from change to be used in concert

418
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,880
with 100 Rel and it would allow the

419
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,440
terminating side through this complex

420
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
mechanism with pracs and updates and

421
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,520
like all these different things be able

422
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,559
to say the party you ended up reaching

423
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,480
when you formed this session when you

424
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,220
sent this invite was somebody different

425
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,520
than you expected and now all future mid

426
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,080
dialogue or dialogue term and in your

427
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,640
quest when they have a from header field

428
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,260
in them it will reflect who that new

429
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,059
Target is

430
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,799
cool idea

431
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,539
of course then we completely redid

432
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,179
everything the 4474 discussed and it's

433
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,559
been clear to us we've had an action

434
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,179
item for some time

435
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,500
um in part I think this is mostly

436
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,020
inspired by the Sip Brandy effort which

437
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,820
is an attempt to figure out a way to

438
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,100
build a full security stack with media

439
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,679
encryption up from what we've built from

440
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,660
stir which is a very laudable goal uh

441
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,919
Stephen Farrell certainly thought it was

442
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,419
a lot of enough goal that he dictated

443
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,120
that we go do this and me and Russ and

444
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,200
Richard Barnes and a bunch of other

445
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,080
people got stuck with that uh task if I

446
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,220
recall

447
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,140
but like there are also a bunch of

448
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,179
practical attacks that can Surface

449
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,460
unfortunately if the only thing you sign

450
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,100
is an invite is a dialogue forming

451
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,559
request and some examples of this like

452
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,299
in the mobile space there are these call

453
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,580
stretching attacks where you have like

454
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,559
two turning sides agree you have a

455
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,059
session and there's some intermediary

456
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,120
though who isn't behaving very well who

457
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,880
decides to kind of Forge a Buy in One

458
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,799
Direction in order to convince one side

459
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,480
of the call that it terminated earlier

460
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,400
than the other side of the call so that

461
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,980
for very high rate calls you can kind of

462
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,200
collect an extra like second or two you

463
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,419
maybe in the middle there like as you're

464
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,240
the transit Network for it and like I'm

465
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,400
going to lose my monitor here

466
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,980
and uh

467
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,140
you know the this is something it would

468
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,580
be great to be able to be right an

469
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,260
untrusted Transit Network who is

470
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,840
exploiting this over wide right you know

471
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,280
people do this for like every call right

472
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,840
and some of these terrible Transit

473
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,059
Network fraud cases and each one may

474
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,380
only give you a little bit but if you're

475
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,659
Crossing millions of calls over months

476
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,220
and months and months it all adds up and

477
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,000
you can actually

478
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,700
quite a bit of fraudulent money from it

479
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,020
um I'm also concerned about some of

480
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,059
these route hijacking attacks these are

481
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,220
attacks where because routing a voice

482
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,500
for IP calls is not always always based

483
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,640
on like authoritative or public

484
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,919
databases but instead on forwarding

485
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,960
tables on flat files that reside in

486
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,340
various Networks

487
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,500
you know you never really know for some

488
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,059
of these IP calls if you're actually

489
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,000
reaching the party you intended to reach

490
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,460
okay now this was never in the original

491
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,080
RFC 7375 threat model for sip

492
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,480
um our first error and like we had to do

493
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,419
some work to figure out how to get the

494
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,919
charter fixed to that the charter is now

495
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,299
fixed for that

496
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,659
so next slide right is this like a touch

497
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,059
screen right I don't know I just asked

498
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,580
miraculously nope nope

499
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,260
the monitor thing is about to shut down

500
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,700
for lack of activity because you're not

501
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,780
moving around enough or something

502
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,559
can yeah maybe I just take I just uh is

503
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,539
this thing doing I don't think so yeah

504
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,100
I'll probably just Advance the slide why

505
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,419
don't you advance the slide we'll see if

506
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,559
we can work through this issue

507
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,539
okay

508
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:29,059
it's just the next sliders that's weird

509
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,700
okay well I think we can go with this as

510
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,200
the next slide I'm going to pretend this

511
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,799
is the next slide

512
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,840
okay

513
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,080
now okay so next slide

514
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,840
yeah okay this is the next line good

515
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,520
enough for me okay so there's a new

516
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,620
version that I just put out and this

517
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,020
contains a bunch of stuff that John made

518
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,720
up this is very different from what John

519
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Elwell originally put in RFC 4916 it's a

520
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,880
significant departure and it's based on

521
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,919
the nation why don't we just let there

522
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,500
be identity headers in responses in

523
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,260
provisional and final responses and so

524
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,559
at a high level this is a major revision

525
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,200
that you know says let's pivot to this

526
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,059
is the main way we imagine that connect

527
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,820
identity could work for start it

528
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,980
introduces a new passport type that we

529
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,500
call RSP this can only appear in

530
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,880
responses

531
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,679
it has some rules for interaction with

532
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,240
diversion that are interesting that are

533
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,740
based on some things I added to the

534
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,679
diversion spec very late in its uh

535
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:36,659
development for cases where you might

536
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,520
want to be able to reflect diversion

537
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,860
headers back to the called party in

538
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,940
cases where you're dealing with

539
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,400
redirection in other words where if you

540
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,140
you have a column that's being processed

541
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,880
and it hits a redirect server and it

542
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,400
sends back a 302 you want to be able to

543
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,620
collect the divs that existed to date

544
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,500
before you then create a new request and

545
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,539
embed those divs in it it was actually

546
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,100
this div reflection thing that gave me

547
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,539
the idea for doing this in the first

548
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,700
place and the general Practice in div of

549
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,100
signing the desk of the passport rather

550
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,320
than the ridge of the passport the

551
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,000
moving pieces of that have come together

552
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,299
into this RSP concept but I will say I

553
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,820
did not pull all of the 4916 from change

554
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,980
mechanism out of this this is still in

555
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,840
there and we may still need it and

556
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,860
that's something I want to talk about

557
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,020
today whether we still need it or not I

558
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,240
hope we don't but let's let's go through

559
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,500
it so next slide please

560
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,700
so like

561
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,980
yeah what RSP does as I said it's

562
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,900
basically a past part that is on the way

563
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,960
that div is you assume that um you know

564
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,179
this a call has reached determining

565
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,340
party the tournament party may or may

566
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,900
not at this point be the same person

567
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,179
that you originally intended to be the

568
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:46,799
destination for the call diversion could

569
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,120
have happened so either way though

570
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,460
you're going to take a new passport

571
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,720
you're going to sign that's going to be

572
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,820
populated just like the original

573
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,220
passport was with the same Ridge desk

574
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,700
and so on you're gonna then sign that

575
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,159
with a credential that is responsible

576
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
for the telephone number that appears in

577
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,020
the desk field of this and you're going

578
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,520
to be able to embed this in responses

579
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,559
you send in the backwards Direction

580
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,059
and in the sunny day case where there's

581
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,159
no diversion this actually sounds pretty

582
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,039
simple doesn't it right like I mean okay

583
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,440
you get a request in it is signed you

584
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,820
say great I'm going to make a passport

585
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,760
looks just like the passport I just saw

586
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,799
um we're gonna instead sign for it with

587
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,480
my credential instead of the credential

588
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,159
that originally signed for the passport

589
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,940
ship it out and what a X or in a 200.

590
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,460
and like for the basic sip Brandy use

591
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,200
case where what you want is protection

592
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,960
for m key that is for the media Keys

593
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,460
there's this little field that lets you

594
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,200
have the fingerprints that will appear

595
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,020
in the media keys in sdp or like dtls

596
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,059
srtp or whatever

597
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,120
um

598
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,039
I may be turning my head a little bit as

599
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,600
I do this

600
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,279
um you know I think this is basically

601
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,900
good enough for that in the sunny day

602
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,020
case like this will enable

603
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,179
um both sides to have cryptographic

604
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,760
protection for that m key and you be

605
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,500
able to ascertain yeah the right people

606
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,880
roughly were signing for this

607
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,740
Simplicity itself right we're done

608
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,380
okay next slide

609
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,500
um

610
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,559
we're gonna get into a couple of caveats

611
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,940
and these are the reasons why we didn't

612
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,039
do this in the first place and I have

613
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,279
Distant Memories of Me castigating John

614
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,020
Elwell when he was standing where I am

615
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,820
now and I was at the mic and I was

616
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,440
telling him why things like this that

617
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,299
are so simple aren't going to work

618
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,000
and like so sure we all know that

619
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,440
provisional responses are not

620
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,120
necessarily reliable and there are all

621
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,440
kinds of cases where like forking

622
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,299
prockies proxies may be collecting them

623
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,559
and they'll never actually end up

624
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,200
getting back to the original uas let

625
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,340
alone the original authentication

626
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,200
Service or the verification service on

627
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,840
the originating side you know I can kind

628
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,760
of live with that like sometimes this is

629
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,980
going to work sometimes it's not by the

630
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,720
time there's a final response with the

631
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,779
200 okay has you know the the proper

632
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,820
passport embedded in its identity header

633
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,340
you that'll be authoritative for the

634
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,440
call real problems were in the second

635
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,179
thing they are the second thing they're

636
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,640
reject sit responses

637
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,000
requests you can send 401s and 407s you

638
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,740
can use all kinds of fancy error codes

639
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,840
we've defined specifically for stir to

640
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,940
be able to explain here is a repairable

641
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,159
condition you could fix like I don't

642
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,140
support your trust anchor or I look at

643
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,640
those passwords and I spell formed

644
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,080
there's like all these things you can

645
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,940
kind of communicate back as feedback

646
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,340
that it would be really nice to have I

647
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,600
mean honestly just being able to

648
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,039
challenge would be really nice to have

649
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,320
right I mean our assumption in stir is

650
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,240
that if I send an invite up to an

651
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,980
authentication Service and the

652
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,140
authentication Service you know needs

653
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,340
doesn't know who I am needs to challenge

654
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,679
me with digest or something oh I get it

655
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,159
your JDR you know your JDR jdr.net

656
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,620
fantastic like you know now I know I can

657
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,620
sign for you on on your behalf

658
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,140
um that part is uh

659
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,299
it's it's hard hard to miss but you can

660
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,460
imagine in a lot of cases there are

661
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,679
reasons why that request got forwarded

662
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,059
to the ultimate endpoint that is

663
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,799
responding that this is all coming from

664
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,320
there are location services and so on

665
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,840
that are you know pretty much can figure

666
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,020
out is the The Entity that is sending

667
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,340
this response in the backwards Direction

668
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,520
the right entity without having to rely

669
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,500
on digest to do it I'm pretty confident

670
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,600
that that stuff works

671
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,299
you know another small issue in this is

672
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:39,720
of course that the as needs to be in the

673
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,600
reverse path of the transaction so okay

674
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,220
you need to assume kind of as this is

675
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,240
going through the terminating Network

676
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,020
maybe the vs like adds a via that will

677
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,299
be for the as it goes by

678
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,760
and you know

679
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,940
in practice though the real reason why I

680
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,860
just don't care anymore is because in

681
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,260
reality all this sip detail about how

682
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,419
via's and those other things were is

683
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:04,799
kind of immaterial to the way that this

684
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,419
mostly works in the field for Star shake

685
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,340
it how does this actually work there is

686
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,080
an SVC it sits on the edge of the

687
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,880
network all of your traffic goes in and

688
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,799
out of that thing right and that thing

689
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,960
just has an API that actually talks to

690
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,679
an as and a vs over https right and like

691
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,899
having that the list of telling that

692
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,760
thing okay when requests you know

693
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,140
requests go through you know you're

694
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,299
doing a vesting responses come in the

695
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,820
backwards Direction just send them up to

696
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,100
the AES and get an identity signature

697
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,159
from it right like so I I think I mean

698
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,020
not everything works that day there are

699
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,179
sip like services that require this

700
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,399
thing where the as actually adds a via

701
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:44,520
uh the vs ads Avaya to make sure that

702
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,500
this will go in the backwards Direction

703
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,960
Through the as but practically speaking

704
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,000
like most of the way skirt shaking is

705
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,740
working today in the world you're just

706
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,020
going through your PC the SEF or you're

707
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,299
like you know some SBC function that's

708
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,279
going to see this anyway so I'm not

709
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,640
super worried about that anymore

710
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,679
if you do want to be able to reject

711
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,480
identities in the backwards Direction I

712
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,980
think you need all that from change

713
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,899
stuff all those updates all the things

714
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:13,620
that are in RFC 4916 it's really really

715
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,600
clunky and I just think it's too

716
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,039
complicated for people to implement

717
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,080
which is what motivated me to look for

718
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,960
something simpler that was actually just

719
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,880
going to get the job done based on what

720
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,240
the 80 of the time case is and that's

721
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,919
where we're going with this next slide

722
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,940
Dave is another interesting Wrinkle in

723
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,179
this so the sunny day case where okay I

724
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,740
was trying to call Fidelity Investments

725
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,360
and great I ended up reaching Fidelity

726
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,679
Investments that's what's come back in

727
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,779
Connected identity

728
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,880
um you know that that looks great I

729
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,559
think with what we've stipulated so far

730
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,480
case is where well I'm like trying to

731
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,059
reach Cullen but like it actually turns

732
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,340
out that you know Yuri is the one that

733
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,320
is responding and it's Yuri's connected

734
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,559
identity that is coming back in this 183

735
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,440
response or 200k response like that's a

736
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,200
little Messier but building on what we

737
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,760
implemented and did for redirection

738
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,240
cases my proposal is you collect the div

739
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,179
headers that resulted in this call going

740
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:17,700
to Erie anytime the target changed

741
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,919
sufficiently within the canonicalization

742
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,700
definitions of 8224 that a new Target

743
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,140
needed to be signed in a div is

744
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,419
generated let's just take that set of

745
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,899
divs with the RSP passport and ship them

746
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,880
all in the backwards Direction and in

747
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,679
fact there's some language in there now

748
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,419
that's the second major bullet there

749
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,340
that says that if you have a death

750
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,919
you're going to put in RSV and it's not

751
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,779
the desk the original passport that was

752
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,940
forming this dialogue with an invite you

753
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,460
must not send it unless you send at

754
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,100
least one div in a separate identity

755
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,299
header along with it

756
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,440
and this was actually a major weakness

757
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,020
of 4916. when I look at it in retrospect

758
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,640
because John Elmo was really concerned

759
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,220
with making sure you know who it was you

760
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,320
ended up connecting to what div gives

761
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,779
you is cryptography Assurance of that is

762
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,340
the right person you should have

763
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,299
connected to

764
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,919
and you know this isn't always going to

765
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,600
work like not everybody does divs

766
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,519
there's a surprising amount of divs that

767
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,960
are I actually see in production traffic

768
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,940
at this point now that we have enough

769
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,159
production traffic that we can ascertain

770
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,679
what's actually out there but you know

771
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,659
sometimes connected identity isn't going

772
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,760
to work and that's okay

773
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,100
sometimes it's not going to be possible

774
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,200
for the cases like sip Brandy where you

775
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,880
know there's criticality around it and

776
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,260
you'd really want to tear down the

777
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,179
session effectively if I was trying to

778
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,440
connect to someone and I wouldn't have a

779
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,120
Secure Media connection for it to be

780
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,980
encrypted and so on if this stuff

781
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,080
doesn't work you want to just throw the

782
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,299
entire session out the window

783
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,760
um that's okay like as long as it

784
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,100
doesn't result in a security failure as

785
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,980
long as there's not a case where I think

786
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,080
I've connected to the right person and I

787
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,880
have media security and it's it's

788
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,919
working and I get whatever a lock box or

789
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,320
something in my UI as long as I'm not

790
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,880
putting something in there that can

791
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,219
permit that to happen I think this is

792
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,679
sufficient to address the super ND case

793
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,659
and I'm interested in Russia's thoughts

794
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,940
about that

795
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,859
but I mean I've kind of I think there

796
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,540
may be like one or two more slides I

797
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,980
mean

798
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,379
yeah but before we get to this and talk

799
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,418
about the cases for from change

800
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,879
any thoughts

801
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,699
what do you guys think about this

802
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,779
helping hurting

803
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,139
and again the the high level bullet here

804
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,418
is I want a way to do this that is not

805
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,699
going to involve all the craft that was

806
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,280
in 4916 that I think can actually work

807
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,639
for a good chunk of the Practical

808
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,580
deployment use cases for this

809
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,399
all right so uh Jonathan Rosenberg five

810
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,300
nine

811
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,480
um on the mechanism change I mean I

812
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,420
didn't even remember this 49 16 thing I

813
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,160
don't think does anyone I mean like to

814
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,440
my knowledge

815
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,119
like nobody about that I don't even I'm

816
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,260
thinking about on my own I think it

817
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,339
would really work there was still

818
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:12,780
probably race conditions and all kinds

819
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,520
of stuff so I like I don't think

820
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,619
backward compatibility or support for

821
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,240
that is relevant in any way and I

822
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,560
certainly agree with your assessment

823
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,460
that

824
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,920
practically speaking the vast majority

825
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,160
of sip is over TCP a lot of these issues

826
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,140
about reliability or not that relevant

827
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,920
anymore in any way the 2xx is really all

828
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,780
that matters the forking stuff where

829
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,180
that's also nonsense never got

830
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,460
implemented really when it's all B2B

831
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,320
ways it's it's a single to it so I think

832
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,180
this is going to work from a mechanic's

833
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,980
perspective

834
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,700
um

835
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,200
so I'm good with that and I would remove

836
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,180
all of the just get rid of all the

837
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,240
crufts all the from change yeah yeah let

838
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,920
me make the case for phone change in a

839
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,760
minute because I do want to make the

840
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,520
case okay but like you know of the

841
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,680
simplified mechanism yeah what do you

842
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,060
think the bogeys are

843
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,619
I think the big problem you're going to

844
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,000
have with this is the same problem we

845
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,800
had with independent of the protocol

846
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,020
mechanism is that there's no way to make

847
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,760
a useful decision about what you should

848
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,640
do when it doesn't match and it isn't

849
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,740
going to match all the time like

850
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,079
probably more often it won't match then

851
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,220
it will match

852
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,740
given the vagaries of the mess of call

853
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,000
routing that is the public search

854
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,920
telephone Network and so what is one to

855
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,500
do and the answer is there's there's no

856
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,180
way to differentiate a legitimate

857
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,040
mismatch versus a non-legitimate

858
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,020
mismatch from the sequence of divs or

859
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,579
the connected identity

860
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:38,880
and so no way to even inform the user to

861
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,440
allow them to like I can't I can't

862
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,900
construct a user experience that will be

863
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,579
useful to users that will just make them

864
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,500
ignore it so that's my bit it'll just be

865
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,599
useless that's my biggest pitch about

866
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,400
this and I have this in another slide I

867
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,079
think the pitch is that we establish a

868
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,940
criticality mechanism for it for those

869
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,760
cases where users demand criticality in

870
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,500
other words like first hit Brandy great

871
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,420
example if like my only interest is

872
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,980
having this this is this is an

873
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,440
intergovernmental thing that where you

874
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,780
know the FBI is calling the CIA about

875
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,420
something and like if they would push

876
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,520
the criticality button for this and say

877
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,560
for these calls if this doesn't work

878
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,599
don't set up the session

879
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,339
and you might even want that for some

880
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,560
banking Healthcare

881
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,000
um you know kinds of applications as

882
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,160
well so just imagine a UI thing where

883
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,320
you have that ability of criticality to

884
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,520
say like

885
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,200
I I don't want you to set up the session

886
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,839
if this doesn't work I mean even even in

887
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,460
these banking cases given all the

888
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,780
different ways calls get transferred

889
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,760
around like they're not going to match

890
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,160
all the time and it's still your bag

891
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,260
that's that's the problem and humans

892
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,520
rely on

893
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,619
other things in the natural conversation

894
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,180
to make the determination about whether

895
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,619
the call is successful or at it now of

896
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,140
course there are cases of some malicious

897
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,079
guy stealing calls trying to fake out

898
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,240
Fidelity and blah blah blah and like uh

899
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,800
you know I don't think this is gonna fix

900
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,020
that that's that's uh so that's what we

901
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,980
call it

902
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,640
um

903
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,440
I think it's going to be able to tell

904
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,680
you absolutely certainly when it worked

905
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,500
that's true it doesn't fix it but this

906
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,880
is my whole point to us correct like

907
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,560
it's going to tell you when you got it

908
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,180
right right and give you that confidence

909
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,220
in those cases and on the cases where

910
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,380
you don't have it maybe that's when some

911
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,240
kind of knowledge-based application or

912
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,920
like think about this way Fidelity is

913
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,060
calling you

914
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,060
and they want to decide how much kba

915
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,160
they need to do when they reach whoever

916
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,839
it is that picks up the phone you know

917
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,480
like these are cases that I think it

918
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,000
might have some applicability too yeah I

919
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,560
don't like I don't think it's useless

920
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,880
enough that I'm gonna say we shouldn't

921
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,500
do it obviously it's been adopted as a

922
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,300
working group item I'm just like you

923
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,800
know I'm not sure I'll get that much use

924
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,599
it's on my like hey as an implementer

925
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,700
which I am like would I do this I would

926
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,320
not I don't think it's gonna really work

927
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,820
generally for the comic Center and then

928
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,220
it depends on the a massive deployment

929
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,720
of UI and

930
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,880
client changes and as changes that you

931
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,740
know so well also think of the back of

932
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,760
the mind to think about these like

933
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,980
Global operator use cases so through the

934
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,380
gsna where again I think there are

935
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,180
possibilities that there will be a whole

936
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,400
separate thing this is being airlifted

937
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,099
on top of in which case those do address

938
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:09,960
some very particular like that call

939
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,640
stretching thing I was talking about

940
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,380
attacks that people are losing enough

941
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,540
money on right that it's worth worth it

942
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,220
for them to do something yeah okay

943
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,180
um yeah Jonathan Lennox on the question

944
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,300
of having a div if you put a you know

945
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,400
response doesn't match I don't I mean

946
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,619
just addressing this from a very sort of

947
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,320
abstract user experience if I you know

948
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,359
try to call Cullen and I get something

949
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,220
that says no a critical Collins phone I

950
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,060
get things that no you reached

951
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,079
Jonathan's phone and I have a

952
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,339
cryptographic Assurance this is

953
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:39,660
Jonathan's phone

954
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,520
I don't see why it makes a difference to

955
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,420
me whether I have cryptographic

956
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,800
assurances somebody else has thrown

957
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,820
Network thought I should have reached

958
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,500
out with his phone versus I reached

959
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,640
Jonathan's phone for some reason I don't

960
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,760
know why do I care about that difference

961
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,280
so I think you care for the set of use

962
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,619
cases where you have no idea of what it

963
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,060
was you ended up connecting to or why

964
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,099
right I mean what does div really tell

965
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,260
you div tells you you called Fidelity

966
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,500
and Fidelity said you should instead be

967
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,119
connected to the this phone number of

968
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,280
this like work at home agent

969
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,740
right so the point like if you just got

970
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,480
something from work at home agent saying

971
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,119
like hey I'm Fidelity like you know but

972
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,400
the point is

973
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,839
this is Colin authorized that I reached

974
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:20,760
Jonathan as opposed to just some some

975
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,140
random phone Network authorized I

976
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,240
reached Jonathan and and again I think

977
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,800
it becomes clearer when you look at I'm

978
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,119
trying to reach Fidelity and instead

979
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,619
this is this work from home call agent

980
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,060
that I reached that is just a random

981
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,680
number in Omaha

982
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,900
right yeah okay I guess so yeah I guess

983
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,440
that makes some sense

984
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,820
Chris Flynn um

985
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,940
so plus one on the cleanup I think it

986
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,339
was very much needed and I I like to

987
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:49,680
pass forward I I also wanted to bring up

988
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,320
I think this sort of puts us in a good

989
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,140
position from messaging in presence use

990
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,900
cases as a path forward always in the

991
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,460
back of my mind because there's a lot of

992
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,500
connectivity stuff and people to be

993
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,760
thinking about that as well

994
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,780
Ben Campbell pretending to be on the

995
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,300
floor I just uh wanted to refer back to

996
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,619
the comment about you know everyone's

997
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:16,800
TCP these days in fact I hear from some

998
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,599
of the U.S carriers that a lot of their

999
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,000
interconnects are still UDP and still

1000
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,460
had fragmentation problems but honestly

1001
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,380
this is at least to their problems if

1002
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,859
that's the case

1003
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,000
well

1004
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,260
they're they're yeah they're getting

1005
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,119
around that too and it'll be really

1006
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,380
interesting to see how they want to do

1007
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,900
all of this uh out of bounds for that

1008
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,420
case but anyway I I don't think we can

1009
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,280
worry about that because they can't even

1010
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,079
make the basic staircases work much less

1011
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,560
this yeah

1012
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,480
you're going to see a slide about that

1013
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,839
in a moment

1014
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,000
it's just going to say I I like this I

1015
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,380
sort of jumped up when Jonathan said

1016
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,760
that like the majority of cases this

1017
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,079
might not work I don't think I really

1018
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,760
agree on that I I think the vast

1019
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,560
majority of cases I actually care about

1020
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,420
this has a high degree of working on and

1021
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,220
it's going to be call center cases where

1022
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,079
it fails which mostly I don't want those

1023
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:09,720
calls anyway so it doesn't bother me and

1024
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,900
that but so like outbound calling to

1025
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,760
call centers this really helps right

1026
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,579
like like the the bank calling calling

1027
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,619
me individually they can check I

1028
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,240
answered my phone so it helps that that

1029
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,060
sort of case so any cases where the

1030
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,460
destination is it's not a call center

1031
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,380
this has a high degree of help you're

1032
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,859
shaking your head this is the TFA case

1033
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:33,480
if we're messaging in a nutshell right

1034
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,520
like the bank is trying to send a

1035
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,440
message to you and if that that is

1036
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,440
getting hijacked like due to sim swap or

1037
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,820
whatever is the person that got swim

1038
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,140
tops to actually responsible

1039
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,400
remember to rely on all kinds of other

1040
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,099
stuff no so whatever I'm not sure I

1041
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:51,300
agree with John's on this I mean I think

1042
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,800
we agree on that we both agree on this

1043
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,880
is a good thing

1044
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,680
um but I I think and the other thing too

1045
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,720
is like the banking cases in particular

1046
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,220
no that's exactly the people they're

1047
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,420
just gonna go make all this stuff work

1048
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,680
like if it doesn't work in their call

1049
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,880
centers they're going to get call center

1050
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,380
equipment that does work for us they

1051
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,000
really are it's too important for them

1052
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,460
so I think that even for incoming calls

1053
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,500
to bank call centers this is going to

1054
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,180
work just fine because they will go make

1055
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,319
it work

1056
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,420
um but but others won't

1057
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,180
um so I I you know I I just want to you

1058
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,920
know on individual to individual calling

1059
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,960
or company to company or B2B calling the

1060
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,599
vast majority of of calling where you

1061
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:25,920
care about this stuff it probably will

1062
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,180
work I think it's going to be a very

1063
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,859
high success rate so I like the idea I

1064
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,420
mean it is because so much of this

1065
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,880
really is just spcs or Edge elements and

1066
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,760
networks that are requiring both you

1067
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,619
know all legs of the call to Hairpin

1068
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,000
through them at all times and it's

1069
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,619
really not much of a change their apis

1070
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:41,940
to just be able to go get these things

1071
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,440
signed that that's what gives me

1072
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,380
confidence that practically if we

1073
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,540
convince people to do this like it will

1074
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,460
not be a heavy lift for those networks

1075
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,200
to just start having identity of hearing

1076
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,060
responses yeah code's already written in

1077
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,680
already one way and I think that the

1078
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,880
vast majority of cases I care about

1079
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,099
deeply are the Sunny the sunny day case

1080
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:00,660
there's no div there's no waiting thing

1081
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,579
yeah I mean the div case is it's it's

1082
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,079
going to be touch and go man I mean I

1083
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,040
don't know how much we're gonna get that

1084
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,599
to work but I want a story for how it

1085
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,940
could work but it's it's sunny day cases

1086
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,839
are like 90 of the cases and in most

1087
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,460
banks may not even care if there's a div

1088
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,680
how good our cryptography is right they

1089
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,599
want that to be the Sunday decades or

1090
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:19,680
they're not going to be confident Who

1091
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,980
You Are

1092
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,800
okay so are there is there anybody here

1093
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,720
who maybe I should do the case for

1094
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,040
Chrome change before I pose this

1095
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,140
question so let me do this and how we're

1096
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,960
on well we're okaying time right yeah

1097
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,800
um

1098
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,079
all right so what what really is the

1099
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,000
sunny day case and this is going back or

1100
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,800
the the from change case sorry this this

1101
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,140
is going back to what was in 4916

1102
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,220
originally

1103
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:49,140
so a new Option tag was uh specified in

1104
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,260
uh 49.16 and this was still at a time by

1105
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,480
the way where there was some residual

1106
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,240
confusion about what it meant to change

1107
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,880
the from into header field values in zip

1108
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,079
requests back in like RFC uh 2543 which

1109
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,240
I don't see too many people in this room

1110
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,280
to blame for that other than Dr

1111
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,560
Rosenberg oh Jonathan you were there too

1112
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,119
that's true

1113
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,300
um back when uh transaction matching was

1114
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,359
actually done with the values of Roman

1115
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:20,400
2. before we move this all to tags right

1116
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,079
that was still something that

1117
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,099
unfortunately there was a lot of

1118
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,200
implementation of that still out there

1119
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,119
at the time that John Elwell started

1120
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,119
working on what was 4916. now that that

1121
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,220
was at least 20 years ago I believe the

1122
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,200
20th anniversary of sip is upon us that

1123
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,880
it became the law of the land that

1124
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,260
you're instead doing this matching up

1125
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,700
the tags that are hanging off they're

1126
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,920
from in 200 field values and so as a

1127
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,260
consequence of that you know

1128
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,780
the way that from change if we look at

1129
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,220
it I think can be different in a couple

1130
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,740
of respects one of the main ones is

1131
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,960
actually in a sub bullet there a lot of

1132
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,640
people actually sign this up P asserted

1133
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,420
identity field from uh RFC 3325 instead

1134
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,400
of the from and two and indeed nothing

1135
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,440
about the identity to anybody who

1136
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,359
operates that way has anything to do

1137
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,220
with what's in the from enter fields at

1138
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,680
all which is one of the reasons why when

1139
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,420
we look at this and from change I'm a

1140
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,000
little skeptical about

1141
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,920
um what the value of it is but I will

1142
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,740
say this you do get that you can

1143
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,540
challenge right

1144
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,880
um the the connected identity if you

1145
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,500
force this to come in an update message

1146
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,200
like it is possible for you to send 401s

1147
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,819
and four or sevens and validate the

1148
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,200
proper users behind them in this

1149
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,940
instances

1150
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,780
um in some of the mid-call cases where

1151
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,760
uh there's like transfer or something

1152
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,740
and so you want to send an update to say

1153
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,359
hey there's actually a new identity on

1154
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,099
the other side of this like there's

1155
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,200
reasons why you might want to have

1156
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,940
something like from change work in those

1157
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,220
instances but at the end of the day if

1158
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,599
the problem is that when you're signing

1159
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,819
a buy your Ridge does not match the from

1160
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:52,740
header field and you're signing a Buy in

1161
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,359
the backwards Direction in a dialogue

1162
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,520
terminating request I guess my question

1163
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,200
is so what

1164
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,140
right if we assume because yeah I guess

1165
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,599
I'd put it this way the real

1166
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,000
the subtext under everything I'm

1167
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,240
proposing here is that previously stir

1168
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,760
shaking is pretty stateless right you

1169
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,099
send an invite it's got a passport in it

1170
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:16,380
and like somebody checks that and

1171
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,940
validates that before they make a

1172
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,900
decision about how they're going to

1173
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,119
treat the call and then you forget about

1174
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,480
stir shaken entirely bringing this into

1175
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,920
a context where there's connected

1176
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,079
identity where it matters identity does

1177
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,359
in responses and mid dialogue and

1178
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,000
dialogue terminating quests it starts to

1179
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,500
bring in an assumption that there is

1180
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,420
some state that is going to be

1181
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,940
maintained right about who the connected

1182
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,619
parties are on the call that have been

1183
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:43,440
cryptographically verified and that you

1184
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,599
know that does reflect a different

1185
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,760
philosophy that at least we one we have

1186
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,980
not explored to date on this and so I

1187
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,780
don't want to sweep it under the rug but

1188
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,119
I guess I'm just not that concerned if

1189
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:56,040
somebody signs a buy and the ridge does

1190
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,660
not match you're from header field and

1191
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,720
that by I you know

1192
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,940
I'm not that worried because in a lot of

1193
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,099
places PSR identity is actually what

1194
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:06,300
you're signing rather than the problem

1195
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,859
in the first place and it doesn't have

1196
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:09,780
to have any resemblance to the front so

1197
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,760
I think there's there are significant

1198
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,819
deployments where um that that is a

1199
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,819
non-issue

1200
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,160
but that's that's the case for why we

1201
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,619
keep it the two bullets at the top are

1202
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:24,660
can I get a sense from the room I think

1203
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,160
I already heard Jonathan everybody else

1204
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,160
do we want to keep the from change stuff

1205
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,079
in this document we could kick it to

1206
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:33,180
another dot too for this like special

1207
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,920
case where you actually care about this

1208
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,319
stuff and then have like this document

1209
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:39,660
be the place where we do connecting

1210
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,000
identity the way we think is simplest

1211
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,180
and will work for the sunny day cases

1212
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,819
um who the show of hands who who wants

1213
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,520
us to keep the 4916 from change

1214
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,859
mechanism which involves pracs and

1215
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:54,240
updates and all these things happening

1216
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,040
before you reach a dialogue for me is

1217
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,200
that the tool we did oh we do have a

1218
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,960
tool yeah we have a showcase

1219
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,400
while that's running I'm gonna get some

1220
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,240
more water

1221
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,900
what's the question

1222
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,940
yeah I'm sorry

1223
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,280
the question is do we want to fix the

1224
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,380
4916 mechanism there's still work I need

1225
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,960
to do to do that mind you right like

1226
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,000
there's like examples and stuff that can

1227
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,040
be reformulated that don't use the old

1228
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,839
identity info header anymore and things

1229
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,180
like that like they're it's like actual

1230
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,800
work which is why I'd rather pose the

1231
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,440
question before I do that like actual

1232
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,140
work so I said that we want to fix the

1233
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,460
mechan doesn't perform change is that

1234
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,460
good enough well in this document do we

1235
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,760
want to keep the from change mechanism

1236
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,540
of 4916 in this document

1237
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,900
impressive

1238
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,880
can I talk before

1239
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,880
so I'm just uh as Chris went

1240
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,740
um

1241
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,099
I'm curious is it relevant that

1242
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,000
um

1243
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,400
John talked about pserted ID that's

1244
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,800
typically associated with

1245
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,560
personal handsets

1246
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,900
um is it relevant that the use cases

1247
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,700
we're talking about

1248
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,819
the security is associated with

1249
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:13,619
folks that generally don't use P

1250
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,060
asserted ID

1251
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,960
and that's a separate use case and

1252
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,940
I don't know just thought I'd bring that

1253
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,339
up uh that's the thought that came to my

1254
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:24,240
head

1255
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,880
and

1256
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,540
um

1257
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,700
you know I'm sort of

1258
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,560
thinking that having this as a separate

1259
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,540
mechanism that we attack once we

1260
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,640
understand the problem better is is a

1261
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,440
better idea but

1262
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,599
a couple thoughts there's

1263
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,780
yeah I'm not seeing a lot of support for

1264
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,280
uh

1265
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,920
keeping the problem change in here

1266
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,960
I mean honestly when I really looked at

1267
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,640
this I mean I just don't think if we

1268
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,140
will build it I don't it's too

1269
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,819
complicated it was it's always been too

1270
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:56,720
complicated and

1271
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,700
uh so we saw for the minutes we saw six

1272
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,800
people who actively didn't raise their

1273
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,520
hand

1274
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,079
and I assume everyone else didn't raise

1275
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,339
their hand either but they didn't check

1276
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:08,180
a box to say that

1277
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,920
okay next slide not this dog

1278
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,880
yeah I mean I may fix that but that's

1279
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,940
going to end up on the back back burner

1280
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,740
you know I've got I've got a stove with

1281
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,720
like you know there's a front burner and

1282
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,359
the second burner third burner then

1283
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:25,859
there's like a then there's like a hot

1284
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:28,200
plate in my basement like you know

1285
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,819
anyway

1286
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,040
next slide please

1287
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,079
so uh yeah that was my question is is

1288
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,700
this a good direction

1289
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,920
um if so there's a lot to do right I

1290
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,800
sketched some stuff in this document

1291
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,839
um there may be some fancier ways that

1292
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:44,940
we can figure out to get the as in the

1293
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,160
path other than just having the vs at

1294
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,720
Avaya

1295
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,359
um as this this goes in that we can look

1296
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,680
at that

1297
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,480
I am kind of interested in what new

1298
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,579
route hijacking attacks would look like

1299
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:59,040
against this in other words assume that

1300
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,740
this is the law of the land how would I

1301
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,920
synthesize divs and then rest past words

1302
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,260
to make people think that they reach the

1303
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,460
right thing

1304
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,559
and I think there's a whole Vector of

1305
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,420
those that I'd like to look at that I

1306
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,859
think we need serious security

1307
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:15,300
considerations

1308
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,980
um to be able to discuss

1309
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,780
this option tag for criticality of

1310
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,240
connected identity I think that this

1311
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,460
answers part of the question of what the

1312
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,200
user experience around this needs to be

1313
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,180
there's already some text in there that

1314
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,400
actually talks about the existence of

1315
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,099
like directories that you can imagine

1316
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:34,319
people would publish you should get

1317
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,420
connected entity from me like Fidelity

1318
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,339
Investments could have some place and

1319
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:40,160
this is starting to get into D markish

1320
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,140
territory and where you're like you know

1321
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,000
if you don't get connected for me

1322
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,280
there's a problem and like you should

1323
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,260
not do this

1324
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,880
um

1325
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,740
does anybody actually do paid in

1326
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,859
responses today PS3 identity Chris do

1327
00:52:55,859 --> 00:52:58,380
you know or anybody else

1328
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,020
I'm not sure I've seen paid in responses

1329
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,059
but if we're doing this thing you know

1330
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:04,559
we're not going to do from change but

1331
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,780
we'll have a pay that reflects you know

1332
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,720
what the actual identity presenting it

1333
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,900
is we might also as we do this

1334
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,619
update 3325

1335
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,780
we'll leave that to come on

1336
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:26,119
as one of the co-authors of 3325

1337
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,520
I also when I was mulling this over

1338
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,800
before I submitted it I was like should

1339
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,720
we be using opt for this and for those

1340
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,220
of you that don't know opt is something

1341
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,500
that we created

1342
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,140
um for diversion initially that was a

1343
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,880
way that you could embed a passport in

1344
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,260
another passport

1345
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,440
and I looked a bit at the value of okay

1346
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,839
do we want the original passport that is

1347
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,280
being received on the terminating side

1348
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,119
to be embedded in the rest passport that

1349
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,980
would be sent backwards so you have the

1350
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,020
original signature and you have a

1351
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,359
correlation function that's more direct

1352
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,059
from my original mull of that I couldn't

1353
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:08,579
figure out a threat that beat it seemed

1354
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,720
like the kind of thing there must be a

1355
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,400
threat that that could be but then I

1356
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,859
couldn't really think of anything

1357
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:15,480
um but I think we might want to talk

1358
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,800
about it so another there's a laundry

1359
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,540
list of stuff like this I think we'd

1360
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,040
still need to figure out if we want to

1361
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,140
go in this direction

1362
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,359
um it sounds like we're we're gonna say

1363
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:27,720
let's not have 4916 from change in scope

1364
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,640
because that will save me the trouble of

1365
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,680
building those examples and oh my God

1366
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,299
everything else associated with that

1367
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,339
is there anyone we might rope into doing

1368
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:40,260
a little bit of formal analysis of the

1369
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,420
security properties of all of this

1370
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,900
yeah I would love if some academic could

1371
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,480
get some funding to do set security

1372
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,380
analysis of this

1373
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,859
Stephen this is basically mostly what

1374
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,680
Chris went and I you know agree over

1375
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,220
Google Chat is a good idea at like six

1376
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,319
in the morning some days is how this

1377
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:05,640
gets cobbled together

1378
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,420
next slide

1379
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,500
all right so uh obviously we are not

1380
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,059
going to go for working with a group

1381
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:16,920
last call or anything like that at the

1382
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,079
moment but I think I'm taking away from

1383
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:22,079
this permission to go make this real I

1384
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,700
mean I actually did put in quite a bit

1385
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,140
of text about it already but there's

1386
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,940
just there's just a lot that is going to

1387
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,319
need to be done and cleaned up and

1388
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,940
thought through to get it there

1389
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,940
but this has been sitting around forever

1390
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,859
like without any appreciable work on it

1391
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:37,260
and I feel like we need it for a number

1392
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,180
of use cases that I'm now aware out

1393
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,040
there including messaging and including

1394
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,780
some other things and as is that the

1395
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,619
mobile operator space and so um

1396
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:49,020
I guess I'll get to work

1397
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,300
so from the chair perspective just

1398
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,819
wanting to be explicit here uh this is

1399
00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:56,280
an update to uh what was already a

1400
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,380
working group document it's a

1401
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,859
substantial change from it uh I have not

1402
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,599
heard anyone complain that we need to go

1403
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,220
through the adoption process

1404
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,839
with this again so I'm going to assume

1405
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:08,460
that we don't if anyone wants to

1406
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,380
complain about that do it now or hold

1407
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,859
your peace

1408
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,400
okay

1409
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:18,720
okay

1410
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,079
what's next am I still here uh what's

1411
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,000
next uh what was that those kind of

1412
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,020
identity out of bed

1413
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,819
yeah I have like one slide about Ativan

1414
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:34,200
I think we can uh we can have this

1415
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,540
discussion very simply uh there exists a

1416
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,240
service provider at a band draft

1417
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,220
um I'm not aware of anything that needs

1418
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,260
to be done for it in order for it to

1419
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:46,440
advance this is something that is

1420
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,480
um it builds on

1421
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,760
8816 89 16 88 16 uh which is the

1422
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,680
original out of band

1423
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,900
um framework and architecture that

1424
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,960
generally outline ways that you could

1425
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,940
share passports when whatever reason for

1426
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,319
whatever reason sip was not available

1427
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:30,300
to the terminating side while revealing

1428
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,700
as little information as possible to the

1429
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,680
CPS about who the parties were to the

1430
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,000
communication

1431
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,700
the facility facilitating Assumption of

1432
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,040
the service provider oob draft is that

1433
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,059
instead

1434
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,880
there's a little CPS uh call placement

1435
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,160
service that's kind of attached to the

1436
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,800
terminating Network in other words it

1437
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,920
any calls that like you know it can see

1438
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,720
are calls that are going to that Network

1439
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,400
anyway and it's not going to reveal

1440
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,740
anything to anybody because it just at

1441
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,960
least logically lives in the terminating

1442
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,119
side Network

1443
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,400
and this allows us to significantly

1444
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,400
relax some of the very onerous security

1445
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,079
constraints and mechanisms that we use

1446
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,020
to manage out of band in the original

1447
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,680
um 8816. and this is frankly it is

1448
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,480
descriptive this is not prescriptive

1449
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,119
this is descriptive of emerging things

1450
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,619
that are being used in the Enterprise

1451
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:25,260
space for starshaken I would say fairly

1452
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,540
widely at the moment

1453
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,720
um ways that enterprises are able to get

1454
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,339
these tokens

1455
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:34,559
um put into places where terminating

1456
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,220
networks can use them to make sure that

1457
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,579
in particular Enterprises actually place

1458
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:43,799
the calls that are showing up in

1459
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:45,780
terminating networks it is kind of an

1460
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,720
end run I would say around a known

1461
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,819
deficiency well I'll say a known

1462
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,760
vulnerability of the way that chicken

1463
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,859
attestation works and the way that calls

1464
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:58,079
enter the IP and an eye

1465
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,540
and do you have a question already about

1466
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,640
this Ben I was just going to add on to

1467
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,619
that that Addis has been building

1468
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:06,359
heavily on this I don't know if they

1469
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:08,400
reference this as a base draft but uh

1470
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,520
very similarly for uh getting around

1471
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,920
non-ip interconnects

1472
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,960
yeah and just because

1473
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,160
feet between the way that we approach

1474
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,040
this and Addis has our I guess I'll say

1475
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,020
threefold I mean I think the address use

1476
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,020
case is really primarily concerned about

1477
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,940
you know there's an ipn and I and it's

1478
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,859
fast and carriers are connected to it

1479
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:30,059
and then there's like these little

1480
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:33,359
satellites of like TDM that exist on the

1481
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,460
periphery of this and it's looking at

1482
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,040
how to build an adapter right for those

1483
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,260
particular use cases to allow those TDM

1484
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,720
providers to still get passports signed

1485
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,260
and get them out into the ipni

1486
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,920
um it has a security model that rather

1487
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,839
than having the CPS be like logically

1488
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,640
located in a terminating service

1489
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,980
providers network instead there is a

1490
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,900
federation a global Federation or at

1491
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,000
least a national ipn in an Iowa

1492
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,660
Federation of cps's which are required

1493
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,760
to share state with each other in other

1494
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,680
words any passport that is going to be

1495
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,040
pushed to any CPS has to be broadcast to

1496
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,260
all of those cpss in order for this to

1497
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:13,980
work

1498
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,480
and

1499
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,599
um that is that you expect it could be a

1500
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:21,059
very small number of these from an but

1501
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:24,420
but the issue is that there is a um and

1502
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,920
I I don't want to speak to the

1503
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,960
commercial realities of the Sierra and

1504
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,000
the IP ITF and really I should be

1505
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,619
characterizing like addis's proposals in

1506
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:33,780
the ITF this is a little little dirty

1507
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,160
pool for me but

1508
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,140
um you know the reality is that I think

1509
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,299
there are great disparities between the

1510
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:40,980
number of calls and passports that are

1511
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,780
processed by the different entities that

1512
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,480
are participating in the potential CPS

1513
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,599
infrastructure for this and you know as

1514
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:51,720
with any uh peering Arrangement if one

1515
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,180
of these providers has a hundred X as

1516
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,640
many passports as the other one does and

1517
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,460
they're their privacy and like you know

1518
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,859
data collection or per pass basically

1519
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:05,460
implications of sharing things this way

1520
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,619
that I think we we could never accept as

1521
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:09,599
requirements in the ITF

1522
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,640
and thirdly

1523
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,880
um the security model there is not based

1524
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,380
on

1525
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,640
um

1526
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,740
I mean effectively the service federal

1527
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,200
OB draft recommends that we take your

1528
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,599
credentials your stir credentials be

1529
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:26,640
they shaking credentials or whatever and

1530
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,280
use those to form TLS connections these

1531
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,960
cps's to authenticate who the parties

1532
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,220
are they're both provisioning and

1533
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,299
retrieving uh these um passports from

1534
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:37,020
them

1535
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,500
and there is a very different model that

1536
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,940
I think is much more focused on these

1537
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,859
Gateway cases because it's so concerned

1538
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:45,839
about these Edge providers that aren't

1539
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,640
necessarily the service providers

1540
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,920
themselves and so there's a lot more

1541
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,220
leeway for just kind of Brando people to

1542
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,619
like inject passports into it and I

1543
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:57,119
think I think those are the fun like

1544
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,079
here and they actually have those will

1545
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,940
all be Show Stoppers like everything I

1546
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,920
just said would be right so this is my

1547
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,220
attempt to look at this again that is

1548
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,140
descriptive of what I see people doing

1549
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,559
especially in the Enterprise space for

1550
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,440
um out of band that isn't like the Big

1551
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,119
Ten model of oh my God there's only

1552
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,760
there's big cps's in the sky and nobody

1553
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,440
trusts anybody providers don't trust

1554
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,000
them they don't trust providers and

1555
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,559
they're evil entities that want to do

1556
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,180
data collection Instead This is focused

1557
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,099
on getting the call placement service

1558
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:28,500
the CPS model to be something that's

1559
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,299
very tightly coupled with carrier

1560
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:32,839
operations and to use that to try to

1561
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,359
mitigate as much of the Privacy concern

1562
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,619
as possible

1563
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:39,059
this is more than I wanted to say about

1564
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:42,180
this draft but next next slide

1565
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,760
so basically this is just a maintenance

1566
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,500
update I mean there are customers for

1567
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,420
this it's not at US Open it that way

1568
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,319
right there right there are other

1569
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:50,760
service providers especially

1570
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,319
internationally they're very interested

1571
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,240
in being able to do this places that

1572
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,819
have a lot of Legacy TDM that see

1573
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:59,819
tremendous value in it and you know as

1574
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:01,619
Addis is kind of North American specific

1575
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:04,619
and the ietf is not I think we're

1576
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:05,640
looking at this from that more

1577
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,640
International perspective here

1578
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,319
but I don't know what more I need to do

1579
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,319
on this to be honest I mean I know that

1580
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:16,500
we have one issue which is because we

1581
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,040
normatively point to 8816 we would need

1582
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,619
a down ref an ITF last call to

1583
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,960
incorporate some of its mechanisms but

1584
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,420
that procedural thing aside I see no

1585
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,520
reason why we don't Advance this and I

1586
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,720
would like somebody to come forward and

1587
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,520
say what they think more needs to be

1588
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,079
said in this than what the draft says

1589
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,579
already

1590
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:39,240
if not last call it ship it be done we

1591
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,598
need it

1592
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:44,520
Chris went

1593
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,359
um

1594
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:48,540
I agree I think how these things get

1595
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,180
implemented in networks is

1596
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,119
different than what is in the document

1597
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:55,380
so

1598
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,480
I think it everything all the constructs

1599
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,599
are there necessary to enable this and I

1600
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,880
agree with what you said in terms of the

1601
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,460
different deployment of this versus

1602
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:09,180
what I think uh nipka is doing so

1603
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,140
um

1604
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:13,020
so I plus one two

1605
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,400
my school

1606
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,160
this is just a working group chairs get

1607
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,440
a chance to do so so what the chairs are

1608
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,579
hearing here is that we will work in

1609
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:22,140
group life call this documented as soon

1610
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,900
as the chairs get around to it

1611
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,859
real soon now

1612
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,500
that's an easy one

1613
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,760
what's next uh ocsp

1614
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:39,980
I think he merged ocsp yeah

1615
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,240
Allstate can now tell me if I've been in

1616
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,740
the data breach that's a new service I

1617
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,720
just got that as a notification here so

1618
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,280
they're like doing the same kind of data

1619
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,700
breach uh management nice thank you so

1620
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,099
this is one deck for both it is yeah I

1621
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:56,280
mean let's see yeah

1622
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,380
exactly

1623
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,040
um

1624
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,839
yeah so we're going to do one deck for

1625
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:03,720
two drafts here uh and again just to

1626
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,400
give the general introduction to what

1627
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,260
we're trying to accomplish here

1628
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,599
um freshness first or certs

1629
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:10,940
something we know we want to have

1630
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,740
obviously star shirts have expiries

1631
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,780
today from what I see in the field for

1632
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:19,140
shaken I feel like a year yeah a lot of

1633
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,119
them are are a year seems to be the

1634
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,940
expiry obviously we think

1635
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,799
um it would be great if we could get

1636
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:28,319
faster expiry and more of our expiry

1637
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,000
that is focused on a slightly different

1638
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,119
scope than the shaken scope I mean

1639
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,400
increasingly we know now that uh the

1640
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,920
ocns that have been used in issuing

1641
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,799
certificates for shaken have

1642
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,559
um started to give way to a few variants

1643
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:45,900
that are focused on getting non-carrier

1644
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,480
entities more tightly associated with

1645
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,460
the shaken ecosystem which I think is

1646
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:53,700
great and a long long time been needed

1647
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,440
but really I'm going to get down to TN

1648
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,480
auth list is when we start to ask hard

1649
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,460
questions about freshness

1650
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,319
so if you're going to have a tianopolis

1651
01:06:01,319 --> 01:06:04,079
that contains a bunch of TMS TN ranges

1652
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,960
for example rather than ocms things

1653
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,040
start to get a little complicated

1654
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,500
because the inherent dynamism in number

1655
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,260
assignment a carrier might have you know

1656
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,180
this set of numbers this day but then

1657
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,799
there might be an acquisition or they're

1658
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,599
like reporting and there's like all

1659
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:19,859
these different things that can kind of

1660
01:06:19,859 --> 01:06:22,140
complicate anytime we try to kneel down

1661
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,359
exactly what the TNS associated with the

1662
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,039
third are

1663
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:30,420
now back when we did 8226 we put in

1664
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,000
um big patches passages about doing uh

1665
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,039
telephone numbers by reference rather

1666
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,339
than by value so you would be able to

1667
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:41,400
put like an AIA into the cert and there

1668
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,680
would be a URL there you could reference

1669
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,059
that URL and you would get the

1670
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:47,099
absolutely current list of what the

1671
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:48,720
telephone number resources are that are

1672
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,480
associated with this particular server

1673
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,099
the problem with that though you got a

1674
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:55,799
lot of telephone numbers so you know if

1675
01:06:55,799 --> 01:06:58,020
this is like you know thousands and

1676
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,940
thousands of telephone numbers

1677
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,400
um oh yeah millions millions potentially

1678
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,220
telephone numbers like you know you

1679
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:08,400
probably a don't necessarily want to

1680
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,799
share with relying parties this is the

1681
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,480
exact set of telephone numbers the

1682
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,880
entirety of my inventory I control that

1683
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,500
could become a hunt list for the

1684
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,059
marketing of your competitors if they

1685
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:20,099
can just acquire that from a cert these

1686
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:22,740
are basically public information

1687
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,720
um and moreover it's just cumbersome to

1688
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,520
maintain and we'd have to come up with a

1689
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,700
whole change control system and deltas

1690
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,799
and ways to make it efficient especially

1691
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:34,200
if this is very Dynamic and depending on

1692
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,299
like how real time we want it to be so

1693
01:07:36,299 --> 01:07:37,440
it seems like there's just a lot of

1694
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,660
hassle around that so we started looking

1695
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,520
at a couple of approaches to mitigate

1696
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,780
this

1697
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,839
um ocsp and using very short-lived

1698
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,000
certificates potentially certificates on

1699
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,339
an individual TN basis were the two

1700
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:53,099
winners of our beauty contest for this

1701
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:54,299
so we're going to talk a little bit

1702
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:56,880
about ocsp today and how we think this

1703
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,240
can work

1704
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,900
so uh there's a choice to make an ocsp

1705
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,880
and this has reflected the the two

1706
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,740
drafts that we get shoot down

1707
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,079
um ocsp can either be implemented as a

1708
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,000
terminating side query in other words a

1709
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,740
verification service when it gets a call

1710
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,198
signed by assert grabs the cert can look

1711
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:18,660
at the osv URL that's in them every

1712
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,359
certain new star issues has a URL in it

1713
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,160
already that shows our ocsp service

1714
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,859
where you can go like download the stuff

1715
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:27,779
um and query it to say is the

1716
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:29,819
certificate still valid

1717
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:33,960
now what we added in the Baseline

1718
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,899
storage certificates ocsp draft is an

1719
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:38,698
extension and I I'm not actually talking

1720
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,620
about the extension here today I I just

1721
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,120
realized because of course that I'm

1722
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,920
thinking past that at this point but

1723
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,020
what this extension permits is for you

1724
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:49,040
to ask as part of an OS ocsp extension

1725
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,738
is this certificate still valid for this

1726
01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:54,960
particular telephone number

1727
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,939
and this particular telephone number is

1728
01:08:56,939 --> 01:08:59,399
presumably the calling number of

1729
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:00,660
something that is shown up in your

1730
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,520
verification service it's what in is in

1731
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,979
the ridge field you take that you ship

1732
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:07,560
it off to ocsp and say is this as of

1733
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,198
this second still within the cert uh

1734
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:12,238
scope of authority of the certificate

1735
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:14,279
and you just get back a binary yes or no

1736
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:16,738
to that that seemed to mitigate the

1737
01:09:16,738 --> 01:09:19,140
Privacy problems of I'm divulging my

1738
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:21,238
entire multi-million number inventory to

1739
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:23,640
any relying party and also just the

1740
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,738
management of like the size and it just

1741
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:27,779
seemed more efficient right

1742
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:29,520
so that's the way that the base

1743
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,580
terminating side query works but ocsp is

1744
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,799
also famous for stapling

1745
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,439
um and stapling allows you on the

1746
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,080
originating side to add some crypto this

1747
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,319
is used commonly in in TLS that will

1748
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:47,520
tell you yes this CA has preemptively

1749
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,939
said that that number is already you

1750
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:52,920
know is in scope and you will know that

1751
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,179
when you see this on the terminating

1752
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:56,699
side automatically

1753
01:09:56,699 --> 01:09:58,860
and there was a lot of question about

1754
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,320
like whether that should be part of the

1755
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,840
base of CSP draft we decided ultimately

1756
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,360
uh to break it out here at least I

1757
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,060
propose that we have a separate draft

1758
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:11,160
Peterson stir ocsp staple that is going

1759
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,960
to handle the stapling mechanism in

1760
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,760
interest of getting the main ocsp

1761
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,160
mechanism just out and working because

1762
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,199
there are people as Ben and others here

1763
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:20,760
within a test that are like already

1764
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,280
writing this into the aspects and so

1765
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,500
like we kind of want to get the RFC for

1766
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,940
this out so that they'll be able to

1767
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:29,520
reference it in a timely manner I will

1768
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,320
say given the general approaches the

1769
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,060
difference between short-lived certs and

1770
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,280
doing stapling they start to look real

1771
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,640
real similar so much so that like you

1772
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,920
know I would be hard-pressed to find a

1773
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,360
significant technical difference between

1774
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,440
them next slide

1775
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:48,179
so I mean this just kind of shows what

1776
01:10:48,179 --> 01:10:52,020
the main issue is I guess with um ocsb

1777
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,060
validation on the terminating side you

1778
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:57,120
pay an rtt in other words when a call

1779
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,100
shows up on the verification server side

1780
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,980
the classic way ocsp works is while I'm

1781
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,199
validating that cert I find that ocsp

1782
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:07,500
URL in it I do a dip I ask it hey is

1783
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,060
this number in scope for this

1784
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,800
certificate right now or not I get back

1785
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,900
a response yes it is great fantastic

1786
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,480
check mark ship it to the user endpoint

1787
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,300
that cost is paid and I I think these

1788
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,159
distinctions are really important that

1789
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:22,980
cost is paid at a time around when

1790
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:25,980
alerting starts right like you could

1791
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:29,940
start alerting the phone and do this dip

1792
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,820
and probably get the information pushed

1793
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,679
to the user that says whether or not

1794
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:38,280
this was valid before a user could react

1795
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,860
to that and look at their device and see

1796
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,719
what the the number and the check mark

1797
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,120
and so forth on it set so you pay that

1798
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,040
cost then but I think that cost there is

1799
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,480
a little fungible

1800
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,320
next slide

1801
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,480
um so yeah

1802
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:58,440
stapling we think makes this better

1803
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,659
it doesn't make it it's not perfect but

1804
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:02,100
we think it makes it better do we have a

1805
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,440
new draft about it our proposal is that

1806
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,760
we're going to carry the Staple in the

1807
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,380
passport

1808
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,120
um we looked at Alternatives like the

1809
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,159
staple could maybe be in an identity

1810
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:13,860
staple header that would go with SIP the

1811
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,300
reasons I don't want to do that is

1812
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,860
because what if you're using non-sip

1813
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:19,199
protocols for this and moreover if

1814
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,820
you've got like three passports because

1815
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,400
you've got one shaking identity header

1816
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,560
and like two divs in the same request

1817
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,780
like how do I figure out which identity

1818
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,280
staple correlates to with you need to

1819
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,659
like build all that stuff out so I

1820
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:32,460
didn't feel like doing that what this

1821
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,080
implies is that you do need to have the

1822
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,760
Staple in hand when the passport is

1823
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,580
created so in other words either you've

1824
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,640
pre-cached it and this is commonly used

1825
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,800
as I'm sure Russ could a task no CSP

1826
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,500
stapling like you know the ca basically

1827
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,600
would push you I should say the ocsp

1828
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,940
service will push you Staples

1829
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:53,400
periodically for the duration of their

1830
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,980
own expiry and then you don't need a

1831
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,140
query for them at the time that you do

1832
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,420
this validation you just like grab one

1833
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,120
that you know is currently valid and you

1834
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,219
push it into the passport and you're

1835
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:06,060
done

1836
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,800
there is a big difference here that

1837
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,260
minor correction like if in the web

1838
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,080
world if if the web server wants to

1839
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:17,880
staple it queries the CA and then when a

1840
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,460
client comes it already has that answer

1841
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,360
and so which includes it in the first oh

1842
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,980
right yeah because the web server does

1843
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,300
it right it already goes back during the

1844
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,920
handshake that's that's true yes that

1845
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,600
that's that's important it is

1846
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:38,340
yeah related clarification is that you

1847
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,260
know that it's not the CA and the

1848
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,020
current mechanism see it doesn't push uh

1849
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,960
ocsp stuff to the uh the uh holder of

1850
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,400
the certificate this holder certificate

1851
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,020
has to pull it from the ca periodically

1852
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:52,520
like Russ said correct

1853
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,659
yeah I mean it's the holder of the

1854
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:56,699
certificate is the As and the stir model

1855
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,739
right as opposed to the server in the

1856
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:00,600
web model which is why yes I can see

1857
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,260
that okay but but I think it's it's

1858
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,880
it's basically the same thing right it's

1859
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,340
a sense the person who needs who who

1860
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,900
needs this at a station to be available

1861
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,760
to relying parties is the one who's on

1862
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,360
the hook to go get this correct the but

1863
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,400
this thing where I have remember at the

1864
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,380
bottom here this is real significant to

1865
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:22,560
this use case because our OS ocsp

1866
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:27,060
extension is on a per TN answer basis

1867
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,460
if you are going to pre-fetch or

1868
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,500
pre-acquire these things not do this

1869
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,659
during call setup time you need to have

1870
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:36,360
acquired a staple for every individual

1871
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:40,320
TN you could be signing for and if you

1872
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,239
have a lot of TMS if you have 500

1873
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:44,520
million TMS you're signing for you're

1874
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,560
going to have a database of 500 million

1875
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,420
Staples you're going to be maintaining

1876
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,699
that you'll have to be periodically

1877
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:52,739
pushed to you now there there were days

1878
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:54,300
when that used to scare me that sounds

1879
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:55,800
like a lot and it sounds like maybe it's

1880
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,600
a lot of network and you know there's a

1881
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,219
lot of storage or whatever

1882
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:02,179
it's probably okay

1883
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:04,699
probably

1884
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,540
and again the alternative if you don't

1885
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:07,800
want to do that you can always fetch a

1886
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,080
staple for the TN during call setup time

1887
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,800
next slide

1888
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,980
where yeah I mean whoever We Do It

1889
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,080
um you know you either pay the cost of

1890
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,380
having that rtt on the ASI when a call

1891
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,360
comes in for a number if you don't have

1892
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,900
a staple pre-cached already you pay an

1893
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,880
rtt then

1894
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,040
get the scaffold build it into your

1895
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,940
passport ship it across the BS or you

1896
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,219
get all Staples for every potential TN

1897
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:40,199
you could sign for even if you only use

1898
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:43,260
0.001 of those on any given day right

1899
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,420
you get all those Steeples pushed you to

1900
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,159
the as in advance and you always have

1901
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:50,159
them on hand no call set up time impacts

1902
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,739
you're not paying any rtts

1903
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:54,600
okay

1904
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,000
is it a good time to make a call sure

1905
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,460
let me get some more water though okay

1906
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,719
so

1907
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,679
um I think

1908
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:06,480
and and I've sort of talked to John a

1909
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,540
little bit about this I think

1910
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:12,000
the way certificate authorities have

1911
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,020
been implemented they're generally very

1912
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:17,760
closely associated with the

1913
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,460
authentication Solutions

1914
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,960
I think

1915
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,420
we should be very Progressive here and

1916
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:27,260
not have a fragmented set of solutions

1917
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:31,020
and just go right to uh

1918
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,600
Staples

1919
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,719
per TN Staples

1920
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,520
um I I think it's good to bring up all

1921
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,199
the caveats and all those things but I

1922
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,239
think you know

1923
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:47,520
getting to the point where

1924
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,920
even in real time you're creating

1925
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,560
certificates for calls is not

1926
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,280
unrealistic

1927
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,980
yeah exactly here's the mic please yeah

1928
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,840
I'd like to remind people it's remote

1929
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,940
yes I'd like to remind people to use the

1930
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,800
queue and the mic and I think Richard

1931
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,659
for actually using the cube for the next

1932
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:08,400
spot I I'm having trouble getting that

1933
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,719
way Barnes you know you're missing out

1934
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:12,060
this week on some fine dining you really

1935
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,679
need to change your philosophy in life

1936
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,140
anyway

1937
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:18,179
I've made my piece with never going to a

1938
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:23,000
restaurant again so you cannot tempt me

1939
01:17:23,179 --> 01:17:26,280
here what I put in the in the chat which

1940
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,000
is

1941
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,699
um that even if you don't do all this

1942
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:33,179
prefetching and you have the as do an

1943
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:37,500
rtt over to an ocspect at call time like

1944
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,000
you're still getting a privacy benefit

1945
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,980
in that case so ocsp sucks for two

1946
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,960
reasons like one is the rtt and two is

1947
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,460
that it reveals who's calling you know

1948
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,420
totally agreed yeah

1949
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,960
everything is intimidating it might be a

1950
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,280
reason not to do this it's like there's

1951
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,840
still reasons to do this

1952
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,239
no no I agreed I mean and we do have on

1953
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,380
one of the slides somewhere where we

1954
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,480
mentioned that that privacy exposure is

1955
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,860
actually one of the major reasons to do

1956
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:02,640
this

1957
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,140
yeah

1958
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:05,640
cool all right Jonathan Rosenberg five

1959
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,219
nine so I was uh what I'll just restate

1960
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:09,960
what I sat sitting down is practically

1961
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:13,080
speaking as you know most of the time

1962
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,540
the as on the originating side is making

1963
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:18,659
an HTTP query to some third-party vendor

1964
01:18:18,659 --> 01:18:20,159
who's namings with an N or something

1965
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,500
like that and they return assigned

1966
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,120
passport I mean you're already paying

1967
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:27,239
the rtt to get the passport on the ASI

1968
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:29,159
so getting the cert stable cert doesn't

1969
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:30,780
seem like it's not actually going to add

1970
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,820
an additional round trip unless I'm

1971
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,560
missing something right I mean if your

1972
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,500
as vendor happens also to be your ca

1973
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,520
um Jesus I wonder if there are any

1974
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,620
companies

1975
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:41,940
like yeah suddenly that doesn't seem so

1976
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:42,960
bad no that's what I'm saying so

1977
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,100
practice speaking that probably doesn't

1978
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:45,960
matter whereas it's not true on the

1979
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,400
other side so it seems like putting on

1980
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,600
the other thing I was going to say this

1981
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,640
is an adolescent field comment so take

1982
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,219
it as it is like I I wasn't involved in

1983
01:18:56,219 --> 01:18:57,719
the discussion did you guys look at like

1984
01:18:57,719 --> 01:18:59,520
a bloom filter as an alternative way to

1985
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,199
do this Ecker and I actually were just

1986
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,400
talking about that last time so I've

1987
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,659
asked actually to do a full review of

1988
01:19:03,659 --> 01:19:05,699
this and yeah he thinks there is a bloom

1989
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,980
filter way to do this

1990
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,780
um well we're gonna have to see how

1991
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,640
practically that's gonna work but I did

1992
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,520
I did enlist him on this over pizza last

1993
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,219
night okay

1994
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:19,800
that would have been a fun conversation

1995
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,659
yeah well he can't be here he has more

1996
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:24,239
important places to be the hamster well

1997
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,880
Phil's our coach here so I I was just

1998
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,699
gonna reinforce what was just said and

1999
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:31,320
you know like since we're querying

2000
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,960
anyways you know that reduces the

2001
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,540
Privacy thing we need to analyze it etc

2002
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:38,159
etc but

2003
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,080
um but yeah I don't see that as much of

2004
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,159
a problem

2005
01:19:41,159 --> 01:19:43,380
yeah I mean honestly I I didn't make the

2006
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:44,699
same marketing about service provider

2007
01:19:44,699 --> 01:19:48,480
OSP uh OB but really you can right like

2008
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,820
I mean if the AOS function for this is

2009
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,920
already a cloud function that you know

2010
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,739
effectively you know rcps is like

2011
01:19:55,739 --> 01:19:58,380
adjacent to our as and like actually us

2012
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:00,000
sending a passport back is the same

2013
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,980
instance as us putting it in our CPS so

2014
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,960
like it's our slide just went away you

2015
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,340
still have a slightly right you need to

2016
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,760
back up do I I don't know they went away

2017
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,600
oh look

2018
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:13,679
um I mean I think we're pretty much to

2019
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:15,060
it right I think people get what the

2020
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,620
trade-off is I'm sure that my next

2021
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,840
slides are just questions about

2022
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,580
hey what do you think

2023
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:22,739
is this where we were

2024
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:25,739
we went past this past

2025
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,600
I think I think we I think we got to

2026
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,640
here yeah okay so like there's stuff

2027
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,199
that we still need to do right if we're

2028
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,300
gonna flush this out make it work

2029
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,100
um for stapling I mean for example if

2030
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,360
you're gonna have to have all your dibs

2031
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:40,320
stapled might if uh if you want this to

2032
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,600
work as intended and like so I'm gonna

2033
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,679
have to write a bunch of stuff about

2034
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,300
that I don't think the interactions look

2035
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,760
complicated but like it's just got to be

2036
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,659
done

2037
01:20:48,659 --> 01:20:50,940
there's been some talk over on the outer

2038
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,340
side and I do I do distantly hear this

2039
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,620
chatter like you know through various

2040
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:58,560
spies and emissaries about what the

2041
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,000
interaction and coexistence of this is

2042
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,620
with crls

2043
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:04,080
I mean I think my

2044
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,300
um my intuition about this is is that

2045
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:09,300
it's orthogonal in the sense of crls

2046
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:14,159
exist in uh the way that the STI ba has

2047
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,560
you know operated and the way the stics

2048
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,080
under its governance operate so I don't

2049
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,760
think they're going to go away as a

2050
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,080
result of anything that we're doing here

2051
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,659
I do just always want to seize on this

2052
01:21:24,659 --> 01:21:27,300
one small point which is that getting

2053
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,400
back an ocsp response because of our

2054
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,400
extension that says merely this

2055
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,320
telephone number is not in scope for

2056
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,120
this so you get back a no that does not

2057
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,100
mean the search is revoked

2058
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:41,820
right and like so I want and I I keep I

2059
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:44,280
keep shouting this at you know the

2060
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,320
people at Addis that I talk to be really

2061
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,420
careful about the way that you

2062
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,520
talk about this because merely getting

2063
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,980
back like a negative ocsp response for a

2064
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:55,199
particular TN not mean the search is

2065
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,320
remote

2066
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:04,380
yeah and I think I was asking those

2067
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:07,560
questions as well because Chris went um

2068
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:11,340
uh just clarifying you know is OC is the

2069
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:14,100
intent of the draft to only be about

2070
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,659
querying telephone numbers versus

2071
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:18,540
revocation or you know do we need both

2072
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:20,159
mechanisms and I think we should be

2073
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,500
clear about that I mean to me this is an

2074
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,980
attempt to replace TN by value or TMI

2075
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,860
reference in 8226 was something that

2076
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,260
behaves in a way that is much more

2077
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,659
lightweight doesn't have all those State

2078
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:35,460
Management delting and everything else

2079
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,080
problems and doesn't have the Privacy

2080
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,120
revealing problems like that that that's

2081
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,820
that's the job and if it tells you

2082
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,620
anything about certificate livelihood

2083
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:46,699
that's just like gravy

2084
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:50,100
I have a separate comment uh but I

2085
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,179
didn't wanna

2086
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:55,080
if anybody else has comments on that one

2087
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,060
uh this is rough so I just want to make

2088
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,640
sure I understood that last comment if

2089
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,800
you get a no it doesn't mean it's

2090
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,080
revoked it means not this phone number

2091
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,080
not right now yes but if you get a yes

2092
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,360
it means yes the certificate's good and

2093
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,159
is good for this phone number right now

2094
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:14,540
yes okay

2095
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:16,020
it does not mean it's good for any other

2096
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,760
telephone number oh yes correctly at

2097
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,260
least the certificate is not expired or

2098
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,920
compromised yes

2099
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,060
um my other comment was just to sort of

2100
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,380
say what I said before probably

2101
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,239
prematurely but

2102
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:28,440
um

2103
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,980
uh another plea to maybe simplify things

2104
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:34,920
and just talk about stapling with ocsp

2105
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,920
as the only option

2106
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,199
um as the only option as the only option

2107
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:41,640
I mean so that would be an argument to

2108
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,800
recombine the drafts right I'm worried

2109
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,199
about I'm worried about fragmentation

2110
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:49,260
and people getting confused and all the

2111
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,900
good stuff that we talk about

2112
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:52,440
um

2113
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,719
I think this really is the end state

2114
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,620
that we should be at

2115
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:04,100
any more thoughts in the room about that

2116
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:08,179
so uh Jackson

2117
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:11,300
building

2118
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:15,420
so Jack um are we worried about like

2119
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:20,520
normal ocsp not actually solving the

2120
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,040
like Tien by ref privacy issue because

2121
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,380
you could just go through and enumerate

2122
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:28,140
all of the phone numbers which while

2123
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,100
there are a lot of phone numbers

2124
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,780
probably wouldn't be too hard because

2125
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:32,880
you probably have quite a good idea of

2126
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,140
roughly what number they have

2127
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,699
so you mean trial and error I just try

2128
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,980
every phone number and see like

2129
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,540
if it's in the scope of a particular

2130
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:43,440
cert

2131
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,820
yeah just try all of them

2132
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:49,140
yeah I mean I worry about that I mean

2133
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:50,580
there are mitigations for that that I

2134
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:53,040
think we could probably implement but

2135
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,080
I mean so I'm on the fence about that to

2136
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,300
be blind I mean I think

2137
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,060
having something that works as close to

2138
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:03,480
traditional ocsp works is probably valid

2139
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:06,179
in the sense that you know like I said

2140
01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:10,020
we ship an ocsp URL and like every Shake

2141
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:12,540
insert that we issue today right and

2142
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,679
like we have infrastructure that

2143
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:15,480
supports it

2144
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,460
um

2145
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,500
I mean I could be persuaded though that

2146
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:23,400
really the the risks are too severe

2147
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,739
um does does it actually mitigate the

2148
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:29,219
risk though to push it to the as side

2149
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:31,380
in the sense of like there's still an

2150
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:33,300
ocsp service you can still hit it with

2151
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,920
these queries

2152
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,800
I mean unless there's an allow list for

2153
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,679
what the set of a s's are that are

2154
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:43,860
allowed to acquire Staples

2155
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:46,679
yeah you could just not ocsp service

2156
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:48,300
like there's nothing requiring you to

2157
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,920
have that remote ocsp service if

2158
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,760
everything's stapled

2159
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:55,920
just quickly I really fear the the

2160
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,800
verification service side uh complaints

2161
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,139
and things I I think we're going to go

2162
01:26:01,139 --> 01:26:03,239
down in our ad Haul on on that whole

2163
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,659
thing

2164
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:10,139
well are people basically so let's go

2165
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:11,340
through this operationally are people

2166
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,580
cool with the um

2167
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:17,400
passport size increase that staple

2168
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,080
entails

2169
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,580
because this you know we're adding new

2170
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:22,400
staple elements going to be a base64

2171
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,900
encoded element I assume that's going to

2172
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,219
be in the passport

2173
01:26:26,219 --> 01:26:29,100
do who who here would know what the

2174
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,800
rough size estimate is that that's

2175
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,560
adding to a passport like how big is a

2176
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,159
staple Russ

2177
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,320
IA

2178
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,100
because I mean I I know I looked at a

2179
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,540
couple of breakdowns at Staples but they

2180
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,219
were ones that were had already been

2181
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:49,440
decoded right and like listed all the

2182
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,179
stuff that's in it they're not small

2183
01:26:51,179 --> 01:26:52,679
though right

2184
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:55,020
they're not huge either yeah they're not

2185
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:56,400
huge

2186
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,040
um but

2187
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,980
rcd is bigger yeah

2188
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,800
rcd is bigger than a lot of things

2189
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,880
that we also have three people feeling

2190
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,699
cute okay so I'm sorry

2191
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:12,300
and we have three minutes uh John I just

2192
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,639
want to know your thoughts about the

2193
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,020
scenario because

2194
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:20,040
you mentioned that uh TN apartian right

2195
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,679
or the

2196
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:25,440
OSB right that party and verification so

2197
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,620
if that telephone number is not the real

2198
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:31,139
telephone number and then there is

2199
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:33,620
something right which translates

2200
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:37,860
how that use case will be covered

2201
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,659
I'm not sure I followed them for example

2202
01:27:39,659 --> 01:27:42,659
right that uh

2203
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:44,880
I use a different telephone number right

2204
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,400
where they call terminates right but

2205
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,300
what it shows that to

2206
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,159
to outside that okay that is the

2207
01:27:53,159 --> 01:27:54,780
telephone number that's not exactly the

2208
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:57,060
telephone number which translates to a

2209
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:59,580
new number so is it that expectation

2210
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:02,460
that the verifications are service will

2211
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:05,340
have that translation and then that sort

2212
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:08,040
will be issued with that number or the

2213
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:11,239
original number what is

2214
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,520
yes

2215
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,820
yeah I mean I think that is orthogonal

2216
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:22,199
to this I think it should work either

2217
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:24,300
way for as far as I understand what

2218
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,679
you're asking

2219
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,020
yeah so

2220
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,940
yeah so I was I was just trying to

2221
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,159
understand that if it is tied to a

2222
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,500
telephone number right and if that is

2223
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,780
not exactly the telephone number or the

2224
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:39,900
call is terminating how that scenario

2225
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,639
will be called but I mean the point is

2226
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:44,699
yeah I mean when you so you're asking if

2227
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,320
when it's stapled

2228
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,420
well again all you're looking at when

2229
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:49,860
it's stapled is the original telephone

2230
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:52,860
number not the desk right and so it's

2231
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,780
orthogonal because the ridge never

2232
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:56,820
changes the desk can change because the

2233
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,500
portability or translations are

2234
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,300
forwarding are like a whole host of

2235
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,520
things like that but if the ridge ever

2236
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,960
changes you've got a new call in your

2237
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,639
hands right that needs a new password

2238
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:07,500
real quick we have a two-minute warning

2239
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,179
of any of the conversations are

2240
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:10,440
complicated please take them to the list

2241
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,520
let's see if we can work the queue real

2242
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,699
fast

2243
01:29:14,699 --> 01:29:16,139
am I next

2244
01:29:16,139 --> 01:29:18,600
yes Jonathan Rosenberg five nine I think

2245
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,060
less is more in the ASI thing seems

2246
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:21,780
better

2247
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:25,580
just do that is the only option

2248
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,699
Jonathan is the last one right we had we

2249
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:31,440
had Richard but he jumped all right so

2250
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,480
just real quick ethereum so should I

2251
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:36,120
recombine these drafts and just put

2252
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,340
stapled and back in ocsp if that's the

2253
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,600
only thing we're going to do let's not

2254
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,860
do this as ever drafts

2255
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:47,540
does anyone object to that way forward

2256
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,300
I'm not happy about the fact I'm making

2257
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,900
this point but uh if you just have ocsp

2258
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,600
State playing and not ocsp that begins

2259
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,360
to Look a Lot live short-lived certs all

2260
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,239
over again yeah so we say this a lot

2261
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:08,400
where we have in the slide I think the

2262
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,320
difference is so minimal I don't even

2263
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,480
know how to characterize it or make

2264
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,739
technical decisions between them

2265
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,300
what's the point

2266
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,639
so I mean the difference is you're

2267
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,199
either

2268
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:23,880
all right we'll take our last minute to

2269
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,679
discuss this so I mean either the ca

2270
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:27,000
right

2271
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,840
actually synthesizes a a single TM sir

2272
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,000
for like every TN is possible for this

2273
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,159
particular customer to sign for and

2274
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:38,100
pushes them or you query for them as

2275
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,560
needed and sign with them these have to

2276
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,719
expire you have 90 seconds and these

2277
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,639
certs do and then they're gone that that

2278
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,280
is identical to stapling it the the work

2279
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,380
cryptographically of creating that cert

2280
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,120
and then pushing it to the as you have

2281
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,820
the as execute the you know the

2282
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:55,940
signature over the passport with it

2283
01:30:55,940 --> 01:31:00,719
computationally it might be 1.5 times x

2284
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,940
what it costs to generate a staple from

2285
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:05,400
a validation perspective it might again

2286
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,159
like on the on the terminating side you

2287
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,139
say that I don't because that's right

2288
01:31:10,139 --> 01:31:13,920
because if it depends whether he's

2289
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,280
generating a new key for each server

2290
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,639
or he's using or he's getting yeah a

2291
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:24,300
reason if you're sending a CSR with each

2292
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,520
thing up to get your short-lived sir

2293
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,980
then you get two signs you have an Acme

2294
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:31,020
like thing that's doing a gap but but

2295
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:32,820
you save it on the terminating side

2296
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,800
because the terminating side doesn't

2297
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,380
have to validate both the signature on

2298
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:39,300
the passport correct and the staple

2299
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:42,060
that's right so again there is a

2300
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:45,120
trade-off but like exactly but these are

2301
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,440
computational trade-offs these are not

2302
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:47,580
never trade-offs these are not

2303
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,620
differences in rtts that are cause

2304
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:52,380
postal delay these are marginal

2305
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,420
computational differences all right we

2306
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:56,699
are out of time so we very much need to

2307
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:58,440
continue this discussion on the list

2308
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,320
about

2309
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,639
short-lived certs versus ocsp

2310
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:06,659
well and we can wrap that short-lift rap

2311
01:32:06,659 --> 01:32:08,400
somebody else read it somebody tell me

2312
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,320
what you think right like I mean it

2313
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,000
could be that that's really the answer

2314
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,179
if if I felt more like Acme had been

2315
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:16,739
adopted

2316
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:19,320
more for issuing certs overall

2317
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,699
I feel much more comfortable about

2318
01:32:20,699 --> 01:32:23,219
short-lived because Acme Acme has Acme

2319
01:32:23,219 --> 01:32:24,840
star they have like whole systems that

2320
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,300
are designed just for this delivery the

2321
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,560
fact that we have not seen that much

2322
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,380
uptake of the acne protocol makes me a

2323
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:34,199
little nervous about doing short-lived

2324
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:38,000
certs and this is probably better

2325
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:41,159
short-lived certs has terminating side

2326
01:32:41,159 --> 01:32:44,420
transaction I think that's

2327
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:48,320
Mary did you want to say something

2328
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:51,659
with short-lived certs you still need to

2329
01:32:51,659 --> 01:32:54,239
query on the terminating side Murray did

2330
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:57,919
you have any words of wisdom for us nope

2331
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,960
thanks everyone for uh joining today

2332
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,600
we'll see you next time thanks very much

2333
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,179
to jack for taking notes

2334
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:08,159
I I apologize for forgetting to say that

2335
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:09,719
the beginning of the morning

2336
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:12,679
a long time yes

2337
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,380
thank you John

2338
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:27,980
thank you

2339
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,560
very much

2340
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:41,100
always use all the time

2341
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,540
I hope I did I think we had the right

2342
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:45,080
amount of time today

2343
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:50,940
I'm trying to think of something

2344
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,620
horribly offensive to say but but it's

2345
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:55,340
not coming to mind
