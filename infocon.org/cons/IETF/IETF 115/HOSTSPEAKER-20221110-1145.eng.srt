1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,700
uh okay

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,860
oh

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,920
yeah that's right is it just one page

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,260
maybe

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,660
no I'm wondering

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,779
that looks better it does why did that

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:25,800
do that

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,699
okay sorry

9
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,140
foreign

10
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,920
foreign

11
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,280
command minus

12
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,000
there you go

13
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,890
ask me for sure

14
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,999
[Music]

15
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,599
all right after a two-minute launch

16
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,599
today we are ready to rock and roll uh

17
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,700
let me welcome Kevin uh who will be here

18
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,319
with us in room to represent project

19
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,239
Callisto an extraterrestrial

20
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,180
collaboration with webrtc and ab1 if

21
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,560
you're in this room and you are part of

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,360
the RTC web working group raise your

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,580
hand

24
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,440
okay so several people

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,980
um

26
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,440
cool other codec and other friendly

27
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,620
people here take it away

28
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,260
thanks Ted uh it's an honor for me to be

29
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,480
here speaking to all of you uh esteemed

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,220
internet engineering task force members

31
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,200
thank you for having me I'm Kevin I'm

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,720
with Cisco and I wanted to share with

33
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,140
you a brief version of the story of how

34
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,019
we came to participate in Project

35
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,900
Callisto we partnered with Lockheed

36
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,800
Martin

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,599
together with other companies in the

38
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,500
industry like Amazon with their Alexa

39
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Technologies and Apple iPad Technologies

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,780
um to try to solve the problem of real

41
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,379
time or as real time as we can do given

42
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,900
the latencies uh Communications and deep

43
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,640
space exploration

44
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,000
and I want to give credit to the the

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,120
folks who worked on this implementation

46
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,819
and uh and built the original version of

47
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,980
this presentation

48
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,959
um I'm just here to share it with you

49
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,700
all

50
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,420
so what is Project Callisto it's a

51
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,780
technology package on board the Orion

52
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,980
spacecraft to test the viability of

53
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,260
commercial Technologies in space

54
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,519
exploration

55
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,099
uh and I mentioned those Technologies

56
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,980
already as WebEx by Cisco Amazon Alexa

57
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,120
an Apple iPad tablet mounted inside the

58
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,319
Orion spacecraft to allow future manned

59
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,180
or crude excuse me crude uh

60
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,840
space missions to collaborate in near

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,478
Real Time with folks on the ground

62
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,699
and Orion is the deep space exploration

63
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,919
spacecraft built by Lockheed Martin and

64
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,000
Artemis is the series of missions to fly

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,220
that spacecraft to the moon and

66
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,979
ultimately to land on the moon and to

67
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,979
perform Moon exploration and and

68
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,280
ultimately Mars uh

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,620
exploration

70
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,120
okay okay sure thank you

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,820
you can scan that QR code up at the Top

72
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,500
If you want to learn more or go to that

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,720
URL and sing tiny font up in the top

74
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,900
right hand corner Lockheed martin.com

75
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,159
and find the Callisto page there

76
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,139
so Artemis one is the first of the

77
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,400
Artemis missions that will launch from

78
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,259
Kennedy Space Center now targeting

79
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,320
November 16th launch window at 1am

80
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,139
Eastern time that's 6 a.m here in London

81
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,460
for those of us that live here and it

82
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,039
will circumnavigate the moon and return

83
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,360
to Earth as a test flight of this system

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,060
we're all super excited and uh crossing

85
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,039
our fingers that that November 16th date

86
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,780
holds

87
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,780
um they've been monitoring uh the

88
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,840
hurricane weather and there's they've

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,419
had a few uh resets on the on the

90
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,639
calendar but November 16th is the the

91
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,139
current scheduled launch date so we'll

92
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,160
see if that happens

93
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,180
and the challenge that we were asked to

94
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,020
solve

95
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,120
is real-time video HD collaboration in

96
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,360
space

97
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,220
and there was as you can imagine a few

98
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,440
technical challenges

99
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,720
the first one is It's a Long Way to the

100
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,380
Moon

101
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,259
you know our industry standard is 300

102
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,720
milliseconds round trip for real-time

103
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,340
collaboration

104
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,800
uh with project Callisto we were asked

105
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,340
to engineer it to up to 20 seconds or 20

106
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,800
000 milliseconds round trip which is uh

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,539
awfully a long time in the world of

108
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,340
Video Communications as those of you who

109
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,020
work on video now

110
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,360
and if you want to see what

111
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,900
to 20 000 milliseconds looks like uh

112
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,880
oh this is not a build slide I lost my

113
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,500
bill it's because I converted it to PDF

114
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,419
never mind

115
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,280
the PowerPoint version that line draws

116
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,380
out over 20 seconds so you can kind of

117
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,699
experience it

118
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,039
so obviously the questions are are we

119
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,539
going to have delays in the various

120
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,360
protocols not only at the video

121
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,479
bitstream layer in our ab1 codec but

122
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,060
also in protocols you know setting up

123
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,360
signaling uh you know connecting the

124
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,919
Call Etc

125
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,740
and how effective are our error

126
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,319
resilience and Recovery techniques going

127
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,360
to be in the face of these huge

128
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,280
latencies and packet loss and Jitter

129
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,759
thank you

130
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,860
I've got seven seconds remaining

131
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,859
what does that mean

132
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,440
oh

133
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,259
thank you Ted okay thank you yeah do

134
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,460
that do that okay well there we go

135
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,440
so this is how long it takes to send a

136
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,759
video frame

137
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,039
from the Earth to the

138
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,099
moonlander and respond right

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,699
awesome thanks for the demo tip

140
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,060
so the second problem is the satellite

141
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,539
network uh has pacquelos and Jitter and

142
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,280
very low bit rates so it's an

143
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,000
asynchronous network of 200 kilobits per

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,240
second Upstream from the ground to Orion

145
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,060
and one megabit down from Orion to the

146
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,300
ground and of that 200 200 milliseconds

147
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,400
160k of that is video

148
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,900
and 40K of that is audio so you know

149
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,360
that's a challenge to how do we get high

150
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,340
definition 30 frames per second video to

151
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,399
work at 160 kilobits per second

152
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,080
um and there's also pack of loss and

153
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,919
Jitter to contend with

154
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,880
the third problem is the first Artemis

155
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,180
Mission Artemis one is an uncrewed

156
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,260
flight there's no humans on the thing to

157
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,720
to touch the iPad and launch the app and

158
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,000
place the call and all of that stuff so

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,100
how in the world are we gonna solve that

160
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,540
you know how are we going to launch the

161
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,580
application how's the application going

162
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,519
to know when to join the call how you

163
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,019
know what happens if the app crashes

164
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,600
what happens if a pop-up gets in the way

165
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,220
of the application

166
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:08,940
um

167
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,300
and so there's no buddy to touch it and

168
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,980
there's no you know we couldn't use

169
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,920
Audible commands either because our

170
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,899
system is the thing that is receiving

171
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,120
audio from the ground playing it out of

172
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,480
our speaker uh on the iPad tablet and

173
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,860
then you know we could try to Loop that

174
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,240
back into the microphone I suppose but

175
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,860
like what what we'd have to we would

176
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,060
have to have a call up in order to have

177
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,180
that pathway established so like uh so

178
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,580
we had to come up with clever uh

179
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,620
Technologies for that our clever

180
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,660
techniques to solve that problem

181
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,519
so our solution

182
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,420
was to build a custom version of our

183
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,040
WebEx app

184
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,100
highly customized for this mission

185
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,700
and we built a new protocol translation

186
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,640
server that sits on a container

187
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,980
co-resident with our conferencing server

188
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,240
on the ground that we called the ground

189
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,279
control server

190
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,320
and we implemented a new UDP based

191
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,940
signaling protocol that gave us a single

192
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,279
round trip transaction

193
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,399
request response to join the call

194
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,680
eliminating all of the normal TCP and

195
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,620
TLS handshaking and multiple round trips

196
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,779
to get a call up

197
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,779
and that protocol converter simply

198
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,959
converted that new UDP protocol that we

199
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,300
implemented to the normal standard

200
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,420
webrtc HTTP websocket based

201
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,880
Communications protocol that we do

202
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,360
normally on our server for our normal

203
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,940
application

204
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,540
and we set up a simulated network of 20

205
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,279
milliseconds of latency and pack a loss

206
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,860
and Jitter and surprisingly it just

207
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,240
worked like out of the box we were

208
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,399
shocked except

209
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,399
uh h.264 video Codec kind of fell apart

210
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,680
at these low bit rates and looked pretty

211
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,820
bad

212
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,459
so we introduced ab1 into the project

213
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,680
which we had wanted to do but we tested

214
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,740
it with 264 before moving forward with

215
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,220
ab1 so we said yep okay confirmed 264 is

216
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,200
not going to work let's let's go ahead

217
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,120
and Implement everyone

218
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,959
so

219
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,120
uh just a few words about av1 I'm sure

220
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
many of you in the room are aware of it

221
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,320
and many of you I'm sure have

222
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,740
contributed to it but av1 is a new video

223
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,740
Codec designed by the alliance for open

224
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,800
media which was uh

225
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
sponsored by several companies but three

226
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,240
of those were Google Cisco and Mozilla

227
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,579
contributing our very our respective

228
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,220
video Codec Technologies into this

229
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,940
effort to produce a codec that would be

230
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,140
as good or better as h.265 while being

231
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,140
open source and royalty free and you can

232
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,300
read more about it at the you can read

233
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,760
more about R

234
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,380
contribution to that at that link down

235
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,500
at the bottom and I just want to shout

236
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,180
out Jonathan Rosenberg in the room here

237
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,000
for uh initiating and leading this

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,560
effort when when you're at Cisco thank

239
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,040
you Jonathan

240
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,240
um so we have our own implementation of

241
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,880
the Cisco av1 codec and that's primarily

242
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,040
because the aom version is not super

243
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,579
optimized for real-time low latency

244
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,720
bi-directional video conferencing

245
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,120
real-time communication so we have our

246
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
own implementation of the av-1 encoder

247
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,260
developed by colleagues in UK uh uh

248
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,959
Norway and China

249
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,339
and highly optimized for real-time

250
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,940
latency sensitive Communications for

251
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,980
decoding we use the open source davit

252
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,660
decoder from video land that was adopted

253
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,339
by aom

254
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,760
and that gives us these uh our

255
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,360
implementation gives us about 30 percent

256
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,940
uh better compression or 30 percent less

257
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,779
bit rate at uh the same complexity or

258
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,120
the same CPU consumption as our

259
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,660
reference open h.264 codec that we uh

260
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,079
publish in lots of other companies use

261
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,540
and we've integrated av1 into our WebEx

262
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,440
product in WebEx meetings and uh we also

263
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,540
implemented it into this custom version

264
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,240
of the WebEx app and the server the

265
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,060
conferencing server that we created for

266
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,260
this project Calista

267
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,519
so what were the challenges and

268
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,220
solutions at the video Codec bitstream

269
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,660
level that we had to solve so first of

270
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,639
all it had to have great quality or at

271
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,160
least good quality at extremely low bit

272
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,380
rate 160 kilobits per second and to

273
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,760
solve that av1 itself has inherently uh

274
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,519
in it you know lots of tools and

275
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,560
techniques for getting pretty decent

276
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,139
quality at very low bit rates like quad

277
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,500
tree super blocks and context adaptive

278
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,660
entropy coding and various other

279
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,260
techniques so we employed all of those

280
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,380
Second Challenge is the huge uh latency

281
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,420
up to 10 seconds in each Direction so

282
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,860
obviously uh packet loss requesting a

283
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,040
keyframe uh is not going to work so we

284
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,839
just simply ignore keyframe requests and

285
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,959
we generate keyframes periodically

286
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,120
um and then there's packet loss so we

287
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,459
implemented normally uh and I really

288
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,200
enjoyed Luke's presentation earlier

289
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,380
about quick over media uh so if you guys

290
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,420
attended that this morning then you

291
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,740
remember the IPP or IP BP you know Gob

292
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,139
structure that Luke talked about so we

293
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,779
implemented a a broadcast like Gap

294
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,740
structure with discardable P frames

295
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,740
and uh to make it more resilient to

296
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,500
pacalas and then the problem of

297
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,139
keyframes being traditionally very large

298
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,279
and subject to being just uh corrupted

299
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,720
by packet loss in in transit we

300
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,399
downscale have to half the resolution

301
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,560
then encode and then upscale on the

302
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,860
other end when we decode and and we also

303
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,600
allow the quality to kind of build up

304
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,300
over several frames if there's not a lot

305
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,800
of motion in the video

306
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,500
and the server and the app switch

307
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,899
between normal mode and this error

308
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,220
resilient mode described on the right

309
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,920
hand side of the slide based on the

310
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,420
frequency of IDR requests so if we start

311
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,019
getting IDR requests we switch into this

312
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:41,880
resilient mode and then we switch back

313
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,500
out of it to try to increase quality

314
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,399
when

315
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,500
IDR requests are not coming through so

316
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,560
we ignore them but we still get them and

317
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,899
we switch into this mode when as needed

318
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,740
so uh lastly I'll just say that um the

319
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,519
no touching and no audio interface the

320
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,360
solution to that was a custom

321
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,180
like MDM like uh thing that's sort of

322
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,940
like just a URL that says you know push

323
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,420
this URL to the to the OS and it will

324
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,920
launch the app and then we just

325
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,800
automatically join a predetermined

326
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,860
meeting URI so that's how we solve the

327
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,019
the no interaction problem

328
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,940
and I just wanted to close with giving

329
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,060
credit to my colleagues who contributed

330
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,680
to this I was the director of

331
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,500
engineering at the time uh and Thomas

332
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,620
and Dimitri and Alex on our team worked

333
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,139
on this together with many other uh

334
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:44,040
Engineers uh at Cisco and our colleagues

335
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,019
at Lockheed Martin so just wanted to say

336
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,220
thanks to all of them for making this

337
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,180
reality

338
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,860
fingers crossed this thing Launches on

339
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,560
November 16th thank you for having me

340
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:01,530
[Applause]

341
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,260
the queues are open so if you can please

342
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,760
use the tool I realized it was a little

343
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,400
bit hard for people uh because the

344
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,280
because of the URL uh problem on the

345
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,900
agenda

346
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,299
um but uh if you if you can't get into

347
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,799
the tool you can get in line and we'll

348
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,140
recognize you anyway but uh if you could

349
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,000
use the tool to to form a queue that'd

350
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,780
be great

351
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,220
uh Darren Dukes your first

352
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,299
yeah um so what was that what was that

353
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,539
user experience at 10 second delay you

354
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,059
know in One Direction is that going to

355
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,919
be a usable thing for when you tried it

356
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,080
in the labs we did yeah that's a good

357
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,880
question it is you know to be honest

358
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,100
it's a bit of a walkie-talkie kind of

359
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,660
mode

360
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,820
um you certainly can't interrupt each

361
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,220
other uh like you can on a normal video

362
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,039
conference uh even in normal video

363
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,900
conferencing interrupting is you know

364
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,700
you can accidentally step on each other

365
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,320
because of the end latency here that's

366
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,660
just exacerbated right that you really

367
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,520
need to kind of wait and let them finish

368
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,580
talking and uh before you try to speak

369
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,960
over them

370
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
um but other than that it works great

371
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,820
and the uh it's not just video but it's

372
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,580
also real-time whiteboarding and and

373
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,080
content sharing I should have mentioned

374
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,299
that in the presentation so imagine you

375
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,160
know we could draw together it would

376
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,720
take a while for what you've drawn to

377
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,760
show up for me and what I've drawn to

378
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,700
show for you but it works but so in

379
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,260
those space movies where they've got you

380
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,760
know something's gone wrong and the

381
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,140
engineering team's figuring it out they

382
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,460
could like whiteboard the solution

383
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,919
exactly in somewhat slow real time

384
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,220
exactly all right thanks thanks

385
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,520
uh I'm sure yeah

386
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,460
uh I think that uh you you choose the uh

387
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,080
av1 over H2 264 is because it's very

388
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,240
efficient right yes yeah but H2 uh 265

389
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,000
is also very efficient so what's the

390
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,740
benefit

391
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,140
between everyone and yeah

392
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,960
yeah I think from our perspective and I

393
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,400
don't know that everyone in the industry

394
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
shares this perspective but from our

395
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,120
perspective at Cisco uh the challenge

396
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,780
with h.265 is the patent um okay uh

397
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,460
challenge right so

398
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,100
for us ab1 is is open source and free to

399
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,520
use and uh so it makes sense even if

400
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,320
they're roughly equivalent technically

401
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,159
thank you

402
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,380
Jonathan yeah I can't I've tried a

403
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,940
million times and I can't get on the

404
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,160
on-site queue so I apologize Jonathan

405
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,660
Rosenberg super happy to see this this

406
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,039
is awesome

407
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,380
um normally there's a trade-off for

408
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,940
video encoding between computational

409
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,760
complexity and bandwidth uh and so to

410
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,100
get the bandwidth down you know you

411
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,840
could do a lot more work on the encoder

412
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,000
side did you also have computational

413
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,320
constraints but it's computational

414
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,539
complexity leads to I guess weight or

415
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,880
power or something that are all

416
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,740
considerations in the moon so what

417
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,960
what's the compute environment here

418
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
uh that's a good question I don't know

419
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,700
the details of the Apple iPad uh because

420
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,280
it's a it's an Apple iPad mounted inside

421
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,020
oh I missed that it's literally an iPad

422
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,000
it's literally an iPad Pro I thought

423
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,480
there was something

424
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,820
then then I withdraw my question thank

425
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,160
you

426
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,820
laughs

427
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,740
yeah it's a it's a very customized

428
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,720
version of our IOS app running on

429
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,140
uh Darren

430
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,320
uh yeah so just uh just maybe

431
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,520
um

432
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,460
one more with with the uh protocol that

433
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,100
you'd invented the the UDP based one to

434
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,020
get to the spacecraft uh do you see are

435
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,820
there any advantages to that did you did

436
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,720
you kind of discover anything

437
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,520
interesting with having to come up with

438
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,760
that is it usable outside of this use

439
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,679
case

440
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,900
uh that's a great question actually

441
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,640
I guess from our perspective we didn't

442
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,980
think that it was usable outside of this

443
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,340
very constrained use case because you

444
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,840
know we basically are doing you know we

445
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,620
disabled srtp we disabled TLS you know

446
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,200
so not the kind of thing we would

447
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,120
normally recommend you know customers to

448
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,380
do

449
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,100
um

450
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,100
so it was very like purpose Built For

451
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,679
This closed Network system

452
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,860
where confidentiality and and data

453
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,299
integrity and all that are less of a

454
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,659
concern okay and it just there was a

455
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,480
previous uh group above that was in

456
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,220
where we were talking about you know low

457
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,100
power stuff and you know uh it's

458
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,900
particularly

459
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,880
um things that were time sensitive as to

460
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,260
how much bandwidth was available and

461
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,240
whatnot it'd be kind of interesting if

462
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,740
you were to build up from what you got

463
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,039
to with that and minimally add back to

464
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,260
it what you'd end up with that could be

465
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,940
very low bandwidth but still have that

466
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,500
high quality in order to reach those

467
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,840
kind of rural areas yeah maybe on the

468
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,520
moon but yeah it made me feel like the

469
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,659
moon so it's an interesting question

470
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,159
yeah

471
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,080
yeah because I do think that there's a

472
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,760
huge opportunity there and like you know

473
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,640
remote farming communities or or other

474
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,760
places where you're yeah near Earth

475
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,740
orbit satellite networks and being able

476
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,020
to do really

477
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,760
low round trip transmission yeah

478
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,280
Communications yeah yeah I'm from more

479
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,200
Northern ish Canada not very Northern

480
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,299
Canada but uh yeah once you get outside

481
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,340
of the cell ranges right there's not a

482
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,220
lot of bandwidth right yeah thanks okay

483
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,220
Alyssa

484
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,860
um hi Alyssa hey nice to see you good to

485
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,659
see you thanks

486
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,480
uh can you talk a little bit about the

487
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,360
the limitations in terms of the features

488
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,640
and conferencing like could you have two

489
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,320
people on the ground joining a

490
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,780
conference with the moon like like in

491
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,640
terms of our normal typical experience

492
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,500
of video conferencing like what's

493
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,559
available in this context versus what we

494
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,020
are accustomed to is terrestrial users

495
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,400
of WebEx I love that you ask that

496
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,539
question because I should have mentioned

497
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,700
it on the slide because I lost the build

498
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,760
I kind of maybe missed some points

499
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,480
um

500
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,480
so on the ground they have normal WebEx

501
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,140
devices and like our board and our room

502
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,919
systems and our desktop systems like the

503
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,520
um

504
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,940
uh The Desk Pro for example and they're

505
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,860
they're all connected in a conference

506
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,700
with the Orion uh

507
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,240
spacecraft right so they can all have a

508
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,799
you know be having a real-time meeting

509
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,159
and the application that I believe NASA

510
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,320
wants to use it for is to invite you

511
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,679
know students kids other people from the

512
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,020
public into

513
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,480
their Ground Control uh

514
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,820
facility to

515
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,340
experience this and actually collaborate

516
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,580
with astronauts which is pretty cool

517
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,419
yeah that's awesome thanks

518
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:02,720
Juan Carlos

519
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,600
yeah so

520
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,080
I was curious because this is definitely

521
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,840
very interesting uh first use case and

522
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,659
looking into the future uh

523
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,120
we probably will face situations where

524
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,620
we will not have line of sight right

525
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,960
because this is the first time to the

526
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,159
Moon

527
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,080
the yeah that's right around the back

528
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,299
side go around and even further into the

529
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,860
future right you can think of Mars and

530
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,140
that's when normally Leo and stuff like

531
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,120
that right will come into picture when

532
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,460
so that we can

533
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,200
work when there are situations when

534
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,419
there's no line of sight in which cases

535
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,039
most likely there will be satellite

536
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,320
relays right so

537
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,299
have you thought or do you have any idea

538
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,620
in this case you showed that

539
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,799
architecture showing the proxy how you

540
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:01,380
simplify the the signaling uh onto the

541
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,799
space station but uh if ever we put more

542
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,960
relays or an Leo satellite network with

543
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,100
that

544
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,620
also work or have you guys thought about

545
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,299
that multi-hop

546
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,400
architecture that is a really good

547
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,679
question and and we didn't because we

548
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,240
didn't actually have a lot of detail

549
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,840
from NASA about the in in trick you know

550
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,820
the the inside details of how their

551
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,679
network works but it is a satellite

552
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,779
relay-based Network which is why the

553
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,159
latencies are up to 20 seconds because

554
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,539
the average distance from the Earth to

555
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,159
the Moon is much less than 20 seconds

556
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,220
it's like three but they said you need

557
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,600
to engineer for up to 20 seconds and

558
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,679
that's because it's going to be bouncing

559
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,240
off these satellites when it's like on

560
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,159
around the back side of the moon it has

561
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,539
to hit a satellite before it comes to

562
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,940
the Earth and so forth so but I I'm not

563
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,580
as familiar with the you know the

564
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,039
underlying details of how that satellite

565
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,419
network works and what we could do to

566
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,700
optimize it further so okay so there is

567
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,940
already multiple release yeah

568
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,020
extraordination release it goes from

569
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,960
their near-earth uh satellite Network to

570
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,419
their deep space satellite Network as as

571
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,419
it as it goes out even further away to

572
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:07,799
the Moon I think it switches to their

573
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,360
deep space Network

574
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,340
but you don't know how many hops to to I

575
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,500
don't know how many hops okay no

576
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,960
yeah

577
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,820
yeah

578
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,559
thank you you just joke what you just

579
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,880
answered my question because I was

580
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,039
curious how the 20 seconds do come into

581
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,440
place how they would decompose given the

582
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
architecture you showed in the beginning

583
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,279
yeah so so it's it's multiple realize

584
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,260
they are further out and and Bridge

585
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,179
large distances and there's just no one

586
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:35,460
not an easy shortest path yeah exactly

587
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,919
okay would there be any details on that

588
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,360
available at some point Sorry would

589
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,640
there be any details on that structure

590
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,500
available at some point that just let's

591
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,840
just be curious yeah we're super curious

592
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,220
too those details would have to come

593
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,320
from Lockheed and from NASA we were

594
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,779
asked not to I mean they didn't share it

595
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,580
was sort of like they shared with us

596
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,140
what we needed to know and and nothing

597
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,900
more

598
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,159
okay understood and I had to get

599
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,440
permission to to give this presentation

600
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,940
because even this amount of detail is

601
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,039
more than we had previously disclosed in

602
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,120
our uh you know respective marketing

603
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,740
announcements and stuff so I had to go

604
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,299
to them and ask for permission to share

605
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,360
this with you all right cool thanks yeah

606
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,620
oh yeah duncs like maybe you know when

607
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,720
your comment about that tells me you

608
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,340
know and someone asked my customers you

609
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,440
mentioned you disabled all the TLs and

610
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,760
srtp

611
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,740
was that just for practicality or was

612
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,080
that a policy like you know we want you

613
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,279
know people on the ground other people

614
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,900
on the ground people to watch it

615
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,720
live or no is they uh that's a good

616
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,820
question the disabling of TLS was for

617
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,620
practical reason you know to eliminate

618
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,240
around multiple round trips and

619
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,880
eliminate TCP and go with UDP

620
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,980
um but for srtp that was simply a

621
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,360
convenience thing that's like well we

622
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,580
don't need it it's an enclosed almost

623
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,159
like a closed circuit television kind of

624
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,779
network you know it's not connected to

625
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,460
the internet at all uh they're only

626
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,080
wondering and if you had any

627
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,520
thought maybe this isn't directly what

628
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,600
you're working on we had any thoughts

629
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,400
like if you did need to encrypt it how

630
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,860
would you do keying when you have a 20

631
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,080
second latency yeah exactly and like

632
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,760
rollover counters and stuff like that

633
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,440
come into play right did you have any

634
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,820
thoughts about that or just you turned

635
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,679
it off yeah we just no we didn't think

636
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,940
through that very hard we're just like

637
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,679
oh we don't need srtp we'll just disable

638
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,299
it and then so therefore we didn't have

639
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,100
to worry about rollover counters you

640
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,539
know so so we'll point out that if we

641
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:22,740
were doing this super quick you could do

642
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,080
uh zero rtt resumption if you started

643
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,840
the sessions before they left the Earth

644
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,080
that then you'd always just be resuming

645
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,700
something that you already had

646
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,940
um uh set up with the tickets anyway um

647
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,820
oh uh sorry something's wrong with the

648
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,279
um the in-room tools not letting a lot

649
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,559
of people in so uh yeah if I wasn't

650
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,000
clear about that if you can't get into

651
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,559
the tool you can get in line and we'll

652
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,880
just recognize you from the line sorry

653
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,220
about that so um mosinati um just

654
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,720
wondering if uh so this was obviously

655
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,480
for Converse or for human to human use

656
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,120
but I assume that there's a lot of video

657
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,520
you know from you know Telemetry systems

658
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,860
coming back and maybe even you know

659
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,900
robotic control that's you know delayed

660
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,520
in a lot of autonomous within 20 seconds

661
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,559
but maybe human controlled beyond that

662
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,020
is this is some next steps to maybe

663
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,720
think about broadening this to use this

664
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,539
core real-time uh communication

665
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,059
technology to go across all the video

666
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,880
feeds all the or even any sensory feeds

667
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,620
not just the video but any kind of

668
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,480
sensory data that's streaming back to

669
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,700
ground stations and then maybe

670
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,500
something that has a 20 second you know

671
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,380
reaction time that could usefully

672
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,220
feedback and and change the sensory

673
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,899
systems is there any future work to look

674
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,299
at doing something like that I I don't

675
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:42,000
know we had speculated on some things

676
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,799
like that too like for example somebody

677
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,840
on the ground could say hey

678
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,360
um Alexa you know turn the lights on or

679
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,500
turn the music up or whatever

680
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,600
to the uh to the Alexa that's running in

681
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,120
the Orion spacecraft right

682
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,220
um and I don't know if this is true at

683
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,679
all this is a total rumor but uh I

684
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,779
thought that I understood that they also

685
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,179
had a GoPro mounted inside the

686
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,880
spacecraft pointing at the iPad so that

687
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,140
from the ground they could see what's

688
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,539
being displayed on the iPad so there are

689
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,580
other systems and then I don't know

690
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,520
about the actual spacecraft itself and

691
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,880
all of the Telemetry and instrumentation

692
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,559
and all of that on the spacecraft itself

693
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,000
I have known but this was a human to

694
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,159
human intent intended communication

695
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,059
right okay

696
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,220
um while you were talking I I wondered I

697
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,260
know some of these uh WebEx and things

698
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,600
have the ability to do

699
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,760
um closed caption real time do you use

700
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,500
the closed captioning in real time did

701
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,240
you try doing that because I think

702
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,980
that'd be quite useful because of the

703
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,840
time delay being able to refer to the

704
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,100
text so

705
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,080
that that's a fantastic question and

706
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,940
there's a challenge with that which I

707
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,380
can't speak to authoritatively because

708
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,559
I'm not uh on the Amazon Alexa team but

709
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,779
they had the same challenge as uh you

710
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,000
know normally the device is able to

711
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,860
interpret the Wake word

712
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,520
so but then all of the actual

713
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,419
um

714
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,460
you know automatic speech recognition

715
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,640
and all of that stuff is done back in in

716
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,740
the cloud well this system is a closed

717
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,360
system there is no Cloud there is no

718
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,059
back end so they had to build a custom

719
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,100
version my understanding is Amazon had

720
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,140
to build a custom version of Alexa to do

721
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,059
a lot of that locally

722
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,440
and we would have the same problem

723
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,840
within the WebEx app is for real-time

724
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,520
closed captioning and real-time

725
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,820
translation we rely on back-end systems

726
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,399
to do all of that ASR and text-to-speech

727
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,100
and natural language processing NLP and

728
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,919
so forth uh all of that would have to be

729
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,140
built into the app itself

730
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,419
or into the server on the ground and not

731
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:50,460
connected to the internet and you know

732
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,020
it's all of those dependencies would be

733
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,520
the challenge that we would need to

734
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,679
solve

735
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,779
yeah

736
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:00,299
maybe in the future Mission they'll ask

737
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:03,320
us to to work on that

738
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,439
foreign

739
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,039
so um I'll take a moment then to thank

740
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,080
you again and I have to say uh I'm going

741
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,700
to reveal myself as very oh there's

742
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,860
somebody coming to the queue now

743
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,399
just just speak no worries okay sorry

744
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,080
um I just had a quick thought you said

745
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,020
that the terrestrial WebEx clients were

746
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,360
just normal ones right so did you ever

747
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,039
think about

748
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,500
um relaying the cloud processing through

749
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,419
those so that you can do all the

750
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:40,559
captioning of those kinds of extra

751
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,380
Services because those aren't in the

752
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,940
closed Network only I imagine they're

753
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,419
kind of fuel honed

754
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,580
so they are on the closed Network my

755
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,559
understanding so I think the entire

756
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,779
system is not connected to the internet

757
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,220
is what I

758
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,700
was led to understand oh uh so I think

759
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,500
it would still be a challenge too but

760
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,260
but yeah if you could

761
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,059
you know if those could be dual

762
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,460
interfaced with one leg and the NASA

763
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,440
Network and another leg connected to the

764
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,179
public internet then absolutely we could

765
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:15,620
do something like that yeah yeah

766
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:18,659
excuse me

767
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,720
okay

768
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,980
all right

769
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,480
I can't remember whether it was in your

770
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,120
slides but do you sort of took a FEC for

771
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,700
uh some of your Transmissions because it

772
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,320
seems like a

773
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,419
kind of useful thing you're right you

774
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,179
can't do arq for yeah you're right

775
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,460
that's a very good question and and we

776
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,279
should have we did not use FEC just for

777
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,059
this

778
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,159
simple fact that we didn't implement it

779
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,600
in that custom version of the app but

780
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,799
you're right in normal WebEx we

781
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,919
absolutely use FEC and we also use now

782
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,980
RTX re-transmission uh and in

783
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,700
combination so like we can dynamically

784
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,500
switch between forward or correction and

785
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,440
RTX free transmission and we can protect

786
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,059
the RTX packets so that the

787
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,820
re-transmissions have a higher chance of

788
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,159
getting through but we didn't have all

789
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,719
of that in this custom version of the

790
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,699
app so

791
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,320
um but yeah maybe a future version of it

792
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,179
if if NASA asks us to be a part of

793
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,879
Artemis 2 or Artemis 3 maybe we'll do

794
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,080
that because you're right effect would

795
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,639
definitely be useful

796
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,739
I guess sort of to drive that

797
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,480
potentially when it might be useful to

798
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,179
understand what's all lost patents are

799
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,739
around the um

800
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,540
transmissions and what drives those

801
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,800
whether it's solar storms or uh weather

802
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,960
yeah or some other kind of space weather

803
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,060
that then you could maybe alter the

804
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,520
level of FEC that you're using depending

805
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,320
on whether there's a sunspot or

806
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,699
something like that yeah

807
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,918
yeah you're right yeah okay

808
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,780
okay uh so let me let me say thank you

809
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,119
and let me also say uh this is a

810
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,980
wonderful Blast from the Past for me my

811
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,440
very first ietf I was here is a

812
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,680
representative of a contractor to NASA

813
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,140
um helping out with uh the very very

814
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,960
early days of the web so uh seeing this

815
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,839
work come here uh and get talked about

816
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,339
picking up some of the work that was

817
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,920
done here in webrtc uh some of the work

818
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,780
that many of the companies here have

819
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,660
contributed to an av1 and AO media it's

820
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,740
really great

821
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,079
um to see how far we've come and how

822
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,359
close it looks like uh the experience

823
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,220
they'll have and Artemis two and three

824
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,500
when they become crude missions uh to

825
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,540
what we can give our customers so that's

826
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,800
great thank you very much for coming

827
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,520
thank you Ted

828
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,799
all right

829
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,160
that was great thank you very much

830
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,619
well it's been a long time since I've

831
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,579
had to fight with lawyers
