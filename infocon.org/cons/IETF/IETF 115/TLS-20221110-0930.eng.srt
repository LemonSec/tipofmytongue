1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,039
I love it everywhere like immediately

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,660
looks down at their laptop it's like

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,960
let me just make sure that the checkout

4
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,820
so yeah in case anybody's afraid of

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,619
taking notes all we really care about is

6
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,480
the decision points you don't really

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
need to do the play-by-play

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,660
um there's some people in here that

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,760
speak pretty quickly so I don't know if

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
that helps anybody willing to uh well

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,780
thank you I mean don't work don't get me

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,920
wrong I'm one of those people that

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,059

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,739
appreciate it thank you

15
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,279
yep

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,920
um also I'll be watching the zulup room

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,219
but if anybody else wants to help

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,960
um so if anybody wants anything on the

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,300
mic then they're in the in the chat room

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,000
you can put you know Mike colon and then

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,260
your comment and we'll get it right out

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,120
at the microphone and if we miss it keep

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,780
pestering us

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,159
all right I think uh

25
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,100
we're going to get started uh welcome to

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,700
TLS at ietf 115.

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,340
we have note takers and so let's

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,619
um if you're watching this already you

29
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,420
probably already know about the meeting

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,140
tips but please uh we'd like to use the

31
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,400
uh

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,720
uh the the tool the on-site tool to keep

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,700
track of the meeting queue so please

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,939
join that uh so your attendance is taken

35
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,700
and so that you can put yourself in the

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,399
line to go speak at the mic

37
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,799
anything else we need here

38
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,200
let's see

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,259
uh and uh please uh note The Mask policy

40
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,299
and please wear your mask when you're

41
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,860
not uh speaking

42
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,919
or maybe let's see

43
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,780
uh by this time you should be familiar

44
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,940
with the note well

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,819
so uh

46
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,680
just uh

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,319
a reminder of a code of conduct and

48
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,579
rules of participation

49
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,780
there we go so uh TLS working group has

50
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,280
been pretty good in recent times but

51
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,720
we'd like you to make sure that you

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,080
please treat each other with respect

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,239
um and keep the contributions uh

54
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,660
technical

55
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,480
okay I think we have uh

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,920
we have two note takers even this is

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,099
going to be a great meeting

58
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:53,879
um

59
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,519
and again log into the on-site tool

60
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,680
uh and also when you speak at the mic

61
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,560
it's always good to uh let us know who

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,660
you are so that we can note it in the

63
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,379
minutes

64
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,040
properly

65
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,720
we do have a fairly full agenda

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,459
um

67
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,780
but we should be able to get through it

68
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,739
all I think in our time

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
okay you want to do right so since last

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,500
time we had two rfcs published they were

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,480
actually published during the the week

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,940
the days after the uh the last time we

73
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,080
met but it's RFC uh 9257 guidance for

74
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,060
external pre-shared Keys

75
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,340
um usage in TLS and an accompanying one

76
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,220
that was 9258 for importing external

77
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,200
pskas for Tails 1.3

78
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,299
we have delegated credentials in the

79
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,440
queue

80
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,540
um Nicks out for a couple of months but

81
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,819
Richard Barnes has nicely uh agreed as

82
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,140
co-author to kind of as one of the

83
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,580
co-authors to take over and Shepherd

84
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,319
that through so we're in the process of

85
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,000
trying to get that done we have two

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,099
drafts that are kind of paused

87
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,900
um maybe we could consider redoing those

88
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,540
after we get this current crop done

89
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,140
um the rrc for TLS 1.3 and 1.2 draft is

90
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,580
through working group last call I

91
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,659
actually think through multiple working

92
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,000
group last calls it is waiting on me to

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,319
do the write-up I will get that done

94
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,120
shortly and then we'll progress that

95
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,798
forward I did note already there were a

96
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,000
couple of things missing out of it like

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,918
there's not a security consideration so

98
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,660
we kind of got to fix that before I send

99
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,759
it to fall

100
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,800
um compact TLS has expired I don't I

101
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,180
don't think that's means it's going away

102
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,639
permanently I just think that uh we we

103
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,560
the authors got uh got busy doing

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,419
something else and today we're going to

105
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,560
talk about

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,000
uh 84 46 bits 84 47 bits the well-known

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,340
ech config list

108
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,940
um and uh another draft the encrypted

109
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,580
client hello is kind of in pause mode at

110
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,479
this point

111
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,259
um while they're still getting

112
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,300
implementation experience and the hybrid

113
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,259
ke

114
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,940
um in TLS 1.3 is kind of in the same

115
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,960
boat

116
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
um and snip I think we're just kind of

117
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
there's not much to it we're just kind

118
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,759
of waiting for people to like see what

119
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,840
they think about it and then eventually

120
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,699
we'll get to it so I'm hoping maybe in

121
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,620
the next cycle Maybe by March or

122
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,000
slightly after March we'll be moving

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,960
that one forward

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,799
next please

125
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,860
and we have two expired drafts so maybe

126
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,479
at the end if we have some free time we

127
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,460
can talk about them is David Benjamin

128
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,780
here

129
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,880
but anyway we can um maybe talk about

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,900
these two drafts because they were

131
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,400
things that we adopted and they kind of

132
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,360
stalled

133
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,880
and that's it so I think now unless

134
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,199
there's any questions or any further

135
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,880
agenda bash we're gonna hand it over to

136
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,919
Ecker to talk about 8446 bits

137
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,320
so just uh since since we asked about

138
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,340
ctOS

139
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,380
um yeah this is still a live item um I

140
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,419
just proved in PR's for been there today

141
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,620
and I'm not I think he may have just

142
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,880
forgotten just a minute because like

143
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,220
like he was like approve my PR as like

144
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,080
in public so I think he just forgot

145
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,780
um so we can we can take care of that

146
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,440
um

147
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,840
so um as people know um you know we were

148
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,960
gonna quickly Revenue 446 to to fix some

149
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,699
terminology issues and to clarify some

150
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,560
points that as usual turned into a

151
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,759
five-year Mission well I think like a

152
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,380
one and a half year Mission

153
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,639
um but there it is

154
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,380
so I'm hoping to terminate that mission

155
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,580
today

156
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,900
um so the current status is I had a

157
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,300
bunch of outstanding uh PRS I merged

158
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,199
them

159
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,940
um nobody seemed to eject I did run

160
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,560
someone by people um check the change

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,479
log if you disagree

162
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,680
um and of course we'll have a working

163
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,199
across call so you could disagree then

164
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,780
there are a few outstanding PRS and open

165
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,400
issues which I hope to mostly resolve

166
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,680
now with the objective of like cranking

167
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,560
on new version and being done

168
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,720
um next slide so I'm just going to work

169
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,580
through the things that are um that

170
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,319
continue to be outstanding is that they

171
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,759
are

172
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,780
um

173
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,199
so first we had this PR um 1275 or on

174
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,660
unsolicited extensions so the uh the

175
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,500
backstory here is that the I thought the

176
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,639
text was supposed to say and I think

177
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,720
everybody else thought the texture was

178
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,419
supposed to say that basically

179
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,220
um you couldn't send extensions that the

180
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,380
other side hadn't offered

181
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,240
um but when we rewrote the text to sort

182
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,560
of talk about request and response

183
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,940
extensions

184
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,380
um the

185
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,160
um uh Jonathan hoylan felt that so on

186
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,900
your call that like so the pattern here

187
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,340
is like ch

188
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,979
um contains like offer like requests and

189
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,380
ee contains responses and Jonathan

190
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,880
hoyland um I think came to conclusion

191
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,919
that perhaps you could send extension

192
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,160
requests that were in request mode in ee

193
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,419
because they were request not responses

194
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,340
that was not the intention

195
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,680
um so um this PR basically attempts to

196
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,060
make that clear

197
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,860
um it was actually Bank it was for that

198
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,780
clarification I don't see him here so um

199
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,280
if anybody disagrees with assumptions

200
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,060
here

201
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,800
um you know please say so um and if you

202
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,300
don't describe the substance here um you

203
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,500
know take a look at the text or don't

204
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,199
and I'm going to merge it

205
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,240
okay next up

206
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,979
um so um we did a bunch of sort of hand

207
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:58,680
ringing around key update limits in um

208
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,620
RC 9147 for dtls

209
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,500
um uh I um we realized afterwards that

210
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,000
those update limits actually apply just

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,979
as well to TLS and so we pulled them in

212
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:08,880
here

213
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,740
um um we had some text that kind of went

214
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,660
through like the process and I merged it

215
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,360
in and Mt was sort of I and I put a PR

216
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,099
up for It MTV like this text isn't

217
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,500
actually very good which I think it has

218
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,940
some Merit as a point

219
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,960
um so I think there's really a question

220
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,879
of like do we want to just like not be

221
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,440
consistent versus try to work this text

222
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,960
I can go either way um if anybody I feel

223
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,099
strongly about it and now's a good time

224
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,599
otherwise Martin and I will just work it

225
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,640
out

226
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,880
great next up we're going to burn right

227
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,200
through this

228
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,979
um

229
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,099
so um we had a bunch of discussion about

230
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,500
what to do with bogus tickets

231
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,880
um and in the last time we discussed

232
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,560
this I suggested we should add a new

233
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,060
alert that would say like invalid ticket

234
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,860
or ticket invalid or something and I in

235
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,420
fact wrote up a PR for that which is

236
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,100
this PR and then the process that I

237
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,959
noticed we actually added

238
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,820
um previously unknown psk identity

239
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,480
between 80 40 46 8446 and here and so my

240
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,220
claim is that does the job for this and

241
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,660
maybe a word Smith around they'll text

242
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,100
around it but we should just close this

243
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,080
PR so I propose to close the pr and

244
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,220
again if somebody links like the

245
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,899
description of unknown psk identity is

246
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,500
bad then go ahead and tell me that's bad

247
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,420
great

248
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,820
next up

249
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,800
um there's um finally um we have a PR

250
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,500
from um John Matson about

251
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,760
um there's all this text about how you

252
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,519
can't use psks with certificates and

253
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,279
8773 updates that and the text kind of

254
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,140
says like you can't do it unless there's

255
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,060
a uh extension that says you can do it

256
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,580
an a773 says you can do that

257
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,660
um in light is sort of the confusion

258
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,220
about the exact security properties this

259
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,200
I need to carefully review this text

260
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,399
um I'd appreciate if someone else would

261
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,200
too but I think generally this is like

262
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,519
probably on the right track

263
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,720
um we just want to make sure there was

264
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,459
there was like some very like close

265
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,680
parsing of the exact text here in

266
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,300
abundance and papers and so we want to

267
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,560
be sure we clarify it we actually

268
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,779
clarify rather than declarify yeah I

269
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,820
mean and the nice thing is it's like two

270
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,560
sentences yeah so it's not like it's

271
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
super complicated so I'll again I'll

272
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
bounce off other people what else is

273
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,360
that I said that

274
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,980
um next slide

275
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,839
finally we have two open issues um

276
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,120
raised by David Benjamin uh clarifying

277
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,740
the behavior hrr

278
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,180
um I'm not here to tell you the behavior

279
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,339
of hrr is entirely clear but I am here

280
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,380
to tell you that after many discussions

281
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,760
we have not we have not we have not come

282
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,899
to a conclusion that made anybody

283
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,100
happier

284
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,740
um and so um and we discussed last time

285
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,600
the put was either someone comes up with

286
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,980
a proposal to actually improve this text

287
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,660
that we can agree on which nobody has

288
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,000
done or we just say like Hey we're going

289
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,440
to leave it the way it is

290
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,120
um I want to free frame this discussion

291
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
by pointing out that the purpose of this

292
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,320
draft is to clarify 8446 and make it

293
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,300
better and this text is the same text as

294
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,240
an 8446 which is no worse and if we

295
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,339
can't improve it we are clarifying A lot

296
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,540
of other things and so being finished is

297
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,100
a feature and I propose you defer these

298
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,660
and then we can always if people feel

299
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,760
like that to clarify even more later

300
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,860
um we can do so my my suspicion is this

301
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,240
will turn out to be pronouncing a

302
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,140
substantive change not just a

303
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,480
clarification and so probably like I

304
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,800
prefer to defer someone feel strongly

305
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,880
about it

306
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,500
and David and I talked about this a bit

307
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,420
and he didn't have any I think so you

308
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,800
know everybody sort of timed out when I

309
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,700
talked to David he was kind of like I

310
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,899
don't even remember exactly what I

311
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,940
wanted to do here so um never be trying

312
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,079
to reconstruct the state here seemed

313
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,540
very difficult so I posted it for these

314
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,000
this is it so

315
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,560
um I'm not hearing any objection to any

316
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,820
of this stuff

317
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,740
um so this is like your next to last

318
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,899
call for this

319
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,100
um oh empty

320
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,579
yeah

321
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,800
do all of these things and then we'll be

322
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,160
done and as you say finishes a feature I

323
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,240
don't want to make

324
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,060
substantive changes yeah to the protocol

325
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,700
that was at all yeah so if David's

326
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,620
entertaining that sort of thing then I

327
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,839
would oppose that okay clarification is

328
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,940
fine but sounds good

329
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,560
I see somebody else but I can't see if

330
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,518
they are rich thoughts

331
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,040
uh is

332
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,019
able to document what the ambiguities

333
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,120
are and the perfectly reasonable answer

334
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,279
is no I think probably very difficult

335
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,680
fine

336
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,880
um

337
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,700
okay so I will I will finish these

338
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,540
things

339
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,519
um and I will produce a new draft and we

340
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,860
can let's call it so I'll let you know

341
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,959
that my long-term plan is is not to

342
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,240
stick Ecker with this this idea but I'd

343
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,740
like to move this to internet standard I

344
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,000
know some of you think that's great some

345
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,399
of you could give a sorry but um

346
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,860
good don't care less but um in six

347
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,720
months we can do a protocol action and

348
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,519
just move it because there is enough

349
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,660
deployment and there is enough

350
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,820
interoperability I may need to lead on

351
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,959
some of you to make sure that the

352
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,279
features are actually all implemented

353
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,620
properly blah blah blah but I think we

354
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,760
can we can write a small

355
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,200
interoperability or I can write a

356
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,240
smaller for operability report that you

357
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,519
as implementers review and then we can

358
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,720
move to

359
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,279
um we can move it

360
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,660
can I ask you a question does that

361
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,220
require a new RFC number or do we just

362
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,560
no I think I can do it in place so just

363
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,820
will save from Place standard on top but

364
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,800
it actually

365
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,219
David

366
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,220
uh David schenazi deployment Enthusiast

367
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,920
uh if we've managed to make IPv6 a full

368
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,260
standard we can probably make trs13 a

369
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,240
full standard

370
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
well yes I'm the person who thinks this

371
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,060
is dumb because I just think we should

372
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,560
have one standard standards level so

373
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,940
that's that's but I'm happy to have

374
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,220
other people do work

375
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,180
I fully agree with all of that

376
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,060
all right great thank you

377
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,300
yeah

378
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,480
please

379
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,180
click to share

380
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,420
how about your chair all right cool

381
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,300
all right

382
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,660
so this is for RFC 84 47 bits which is

383
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,360
the ionic considerations for TLS

384
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,180
um 1.3 uh

385
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,000
So currently this draft is written so

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,540
that it obsoletes 8447 which means it

387
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,660
takes all of the text from 8447 and then

388
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,880
tries to modify it in place which is

389
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
really kind of very confusing and

390
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,180
difficult to read and difficult to

391
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,279
review and I think it'll be difficult

392
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,200
for Ayanna to apply

393
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,079
so I kind of I'm proposing we just make

394
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,000
it update so we can just include the

395
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,700
changes it's much less awkward and

396
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,079
easier to deal with

397
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,540
I've done that with Section seven and

398
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,800
I'll do that with the rest of the

399
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,320
document unless somebody really likes it

400
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,639
the way it is

401
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,639
is there anybody objects to

402
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,899
making an update

403
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,300
now I mean I I think this is kind of an

404
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,800
editorial thing and again remember this

405
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,420
whole document is instructions for

406
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,920
Ayanna and at the end of the day

407
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,360
whatever is easier for them to

408
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,519
understand I think is probably a good

409
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,519
thing and they're like should was

410
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,399
updates throughout the document made it

411
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,660
kind of confusing you know like at least

412
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,100
the Laurie was like what are you trying

413
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,019
to say here so

414
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,760
hope people will forgive me not getting

415
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,420
the queue I'll do that shortly um

416
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,860
I've seen a number of times when the isg

417
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,060
gets very bad out of shape about these

418
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,740
kind of diff documents and so I guess I

419
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,060
would just like make sure our ad is

420
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,040
happy with that with that plan

421
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,139
um because if they're if not then like

422
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,820
we'll be you know we then we'll be back

423
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,560
here like in two months so I don't

424
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,940
object but like I just like want to make

425
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,680
sure I fly that

426
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,040
okay

427
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,199
and while Paul's walking up I'll just

428
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,860
quickly add David scanzi uh in general I

429
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,420
prefer obsolete documents because then

430
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,980
you read them you have the whole picture

431
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,279
in your head except hear what it what

432
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,139
matters is not the document it's the

433
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,079
website that Ayanna runs so

434
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,240
this sounds perfect

435
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,920
that would actually be the argument I

436
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,860
would make with the isg

437
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,560
follow-up is 80. so normally the reason

438
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,779
for a div document is that people are

439
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,880
afraid that they're going to open up a

440
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,220
can of worms on other changes

441
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,199
in the document and so they just want to

442
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,839
specifically say this if that div we

443
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,240
don't want to read argue and we discuss

444
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,820
the entire other bulk of the document I

445
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,220
think it doesn't apply here so in that

446
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,079
sense I think the diff does not make any

447
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,600
sense whatsoever yeah great

448
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,560
yeah so we'll we'll get this uh revised

449
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,519
as an update so that it is clearer uh

450
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,579
within the next couple weeks

451
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,440
um rich

452
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,279
what's up rich

453
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,860
hi Rich Sauls is one of the designated

454
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,339
experts it's not just Diana who cares

455
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,279
um and it's fine if it's simpler it

456
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,800
seems I've read both versions and yeah

457
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,440
we can follow the directions either way

458
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,040
great

459
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,019
um next slide so uh

460
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,880
we added some text as to what uh d

461
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,920
should mean so because now if you

462
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,500
remember we've added we have in the

463
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,459
recommended column yes no and d and here

464
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:03,959
we say d

465
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,000
the item is discouraged and should not

466
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,419
or must not be used

467
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,459
that's the text that we propose right

468
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,540
now

469
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,140
um

470
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,419
we'll have time to resolve that but if

471
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,339
people have uh comments it would be

472
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,660
great to get them now

473
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,419
yeah go ahead yeah yeah whatever I'm not

474
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,720
the cue thing takes too long to get into

475
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,079
um so uh who chooses the should or the

476
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,380
must or the should not on the must not

477
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,720
is that just based on

478
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,740
yeah

479
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,200
I think it was intended I don't remember

480
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,480
why we did this I think it was intended

481
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,679
that it

482
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,559
depends on what the context is

483
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,940
um you might have

484
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,179
uh some items that are are

485
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,400
discouraged and they're only applicable

486
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,220
in certain contexts so unless you're in

487
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,480
that context of you know yeah it's kind

488
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,980
of weird to put sort of normative

489
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,539
language in the registry in this way

490
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,600
because it applies to things that have

491
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,039
their own

492
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,080
um each one of the things with a D in

493
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,940
there probably has a document describing

494
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,860
why it's bad idea right

495
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,760
so um maybe just like end end of the

496
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,780
sentence

497
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,620
um

498
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,960
yeah it's discouraged as described in

499
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,340
the in the linked documents or something

500
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,600
like that

501
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,880
yeah I think that would be better I I

502
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,500
tend to agree that this should not and

503
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,720
must not seems to be excessive at this

504
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
point

505
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,679
uh yeah plus one to what Martin just

506
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,580
said okay

507
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,600
any other uh comments

508
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,299
all right then we'll we'll uh reorganize

509
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,380
this so that those uh normative

510
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,940
uh should nuts and must knots are not

511
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,500
there anymore

512
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,380
next

513
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,020
uh

514
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,580
then we uh

515
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,799
we also added some text to the policy

516
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,500
registration policy saying that as

517
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,780
standards action

518
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,480
oh sorry that isg approval is required

519
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,620
for

520
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,780
uh transitions from yes to no yes to

521
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,600
discouraged or discouraged to yes or no

522
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,179
and we probably could clarify that text

523
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,799
a little bit

524
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:26,940
um

525
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,520
but that's the policy that we have

526
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,100
outlined for this and I think that's

527
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,080
reflects what we've discussed previously

528
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,860
any other uh

529
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,460
Martin

530
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,100
is this every state transition

531
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,760
yeah

532
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,480
into y

533
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:06,299
so it's not simply say um I asked you

534
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,020
approval is necessary for all other

535
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,720
state transitions

536
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,559
so I I reviewed this text because we

537
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,500
were copy and pasting it for MLS and I

538
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,940
convinced myself at least that it did

539
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,320
cover all the state transitions because

540
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,720
it talks about

541
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,460
entering the y or n States requiring

542
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,200
approval and then the conditions for

543
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,000
moving from either of those to D so I

544
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,799
think I think that covered all three

545
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,160
legs of the triangle

546
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,220
yeah I I think I'd prefer if it was a

547
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,799
little clearer I think the goal is you

548
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,320
know isg approval for all

549
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,660
um State transitions

550
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,360
um and then standards action for for

551
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,980
getting a y

552
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,559
that's so you're saying for All State

553
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,260
transitions it's uh this basically this

554
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,700
last sentence should be for all their

555
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,380
state transitions

556
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,679
uh isg approval is required yeah or all

557
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,860
other because we we have the adding a

558
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,660
value of y to recommended requires

559
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,220
standards action right so if you're

560
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,500
going from D to y That's standards

561
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,039
action uh which is in contradiction to

562
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,500
the next sentence already yeah yeah

563
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,640
right

564
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,620
yeah I think that would be simpler

565
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,799
it's good

566
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,299
um my question is not about the slide

567
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,400
it's uh more generic so I'm going to let

568
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,240
Paul jump in first

569
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,840
so it may take a little bit uh Paul just

570
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,640
speaking as myself is there a reason

571
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,200
like if you're redoing this part anyway

572
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,059
is there a reason why we're using one

573
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,299
letter abbreviations like are we trying

574
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,200
to save money on the website

575
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,880
so it fits in the columns I mean it just

576
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,559
it's a it looks horrible when you put it

577
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,480
in the document spins across there's a

578
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,220
note in there to explain what it is so

579
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,260
yeah it's just it is a single letter

580
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,700
that we have in the column because

581
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,140
they're so long and like think of The

582
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,780
Cypher Suite names but there's other

583
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,220
places where it's explained what that

584
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,380
means

585
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,520
I mean yeah

586
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,280
we we could expand it out here

587
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,559
um but in the in the call middle I think

588
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,440
it's better for a single letter

589
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,320
David um David schenazi

590
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,299
um so that from looking this looks like

591
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,240
it's your last slide and I followed an

592
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,679
issue on the document a few weeks ago

593
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
and no one has commented on it so I

594
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,520
figured I'd just come and tell you all

595
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,799
about it so I can get opinions

596
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,159
um which is the Explorer labels registry

597
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,539
is currently specification required

598
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,140
and

599
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,880
we were using an Explorer for something

600
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,799
internally at Google and I was like well

601
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,140
crap now we're just gonna squat on it

602
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,059
because we just can't put a create a

603
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:55,440
specification for this specific thing

604
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,780
given that it's a string registry with

605
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,000
infinite room can we just make it expert

606
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,840
review

607
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,179
since we're opening the can of worms

608
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,740
uh feel free to tell me it's how to

609
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,700
scope

610
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,960
well I

611
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,580
I mean we we could certainly make a

612
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,500
change like that in this document but I

613
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,179
thought that it was only specific

614
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,240
prefixes that were

615
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,120
extension I mean uh not not currently

616
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,059
it's the entire thing huh okay Switching

617
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,919
it to the being like that for a specific

618
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,960
prefixes so I'm totally fine by me I

619
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,760
just want a some room where I can

620
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,159
reserve something without make it having

621
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,419
a spec yeah

622
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,460
well David you can just generate a

623
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,679
random uid and put your things after it

624
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,980
um so I think for so first of all I

625
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,240
think specification requires the wrong

626
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,340
standard in any case because what we've

627
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,919
been doing is the way because

628
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:48,780
specification required is the I guess

629
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,340
some unclarity whether it incorporates

630
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,320
IDs and so the way we handled it

631
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,460
everywhere else was we made an expert

632
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,679
review and then said id is good enough

633
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,360
and so I think a minimum we should do

634
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,159
that for this topic I think that that's

635
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,360
I thought that was we did that

636
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,039
universally for all the Registries well

637
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,299
I guess I'm Davis used to think we

638
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:04,860
didn't

639
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,320
um I I haven't checked myself

640
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,480
um but I guess I would be supportive of

641
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,100
this change in fact I'd be supportive I

642
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,520
think generally of the change like

643
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,200
um like I think I think I think this

644
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
plan we had of like you know making

645
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,500
incredibly easy code points was like

646
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,080
super successful and you know and I

647
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,520
actually wonder if like we should make

648
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,220
it even easier and be like you know like

649
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,600
an email will be sufficient and like

650
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
with no description of the mechanism

651
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,140
um you know

652
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,220
um you know these spaces are not the

653
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,299
reason we did this because these spaces

654
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,400
were not the reason so the reason we

655
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,679
require a specification was not out of

656
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,179
some like rate limiting exercise to make

657
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,500
it hard to get the code points but was

658
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,020
merely out of like I think a kind of um

659
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,179
a good government theory about having a

660
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,080
good to have things on the internet

661
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,400
documented

662
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,080
um um but I think that like maybe that

663
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,220
was like the wrong Theory but in any

664
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,760
case um you know uh so I wonder I wonder

665
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,960
I wonder if we should make an even

666
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,460
bigger car about this as maybe a

667
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,840
document required the document could

668
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,159
just say like need or neater we're not

669
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,659
going to tell you what this does I mean

670
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,880
so it it does it does have the language

671
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,380
that we have for the other ones is

672
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,179
sufficient to have an internet draft

673
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,460
that is posted and never published or a

674
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,720
document from another standards body

675
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,240
unit consortia University site the thing

676
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,559
with spec required is it's supposed to

677
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,299
be public you're supposed to be able to

678
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:16,980
get to it so David's Point still kind of

679
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,419
stands right well I guess I guess I'm

680
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,580
wondering would it be sufficient

681
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,900
to have

682
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,799
to have a to have have a redacted

683
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,539
description of the protocol and again

684
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,279
like maybe maybe the answer is merely

685
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,659
first come first serve I guess I just

686
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,760
again I do what I do want to encourage

687
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,900
people to have specifications to be

688
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,279
better for the internet but I also don't

689
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,840
want to make it I don't think it serves

690
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,460
any useful purpose to make it impossible

691
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,200
to get code points if you're not going

692
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,960
to publish what your thing is

693
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,720
yeah yeah go ahead

694
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,020
well I mean that's why I was thinking um

695
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,120
expert review because first come first

696
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,520
serve sure you probably don't

697
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,340
want me registering tls14 and Ecker

698
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,539
stinks

699
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,179
um but if it's you know anything like

700
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,220
there's no point in saying you have to

701
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,659
publish something and that thing can be

702
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,460
empty like that's what expert review

703
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,299
means you know

704
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:10,919
okay

705
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,779
um

706
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,700
I think we'll uh

707
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,220
kind of review this and I think submit a

708
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,900
PR and we'll we'll review it like every

709
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,179
other time so

710
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,740
um so David's out yov

711
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:27,720
so just to make sure I understand

712
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,840
um standard section implies isg approval

713
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,299
because all rfcs are approved by the ISD

714
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,700
so if the working group wants to do uh

715
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,659
say chapter 20 die die document that's a

716
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,080
fine way of turning that from y to n

717
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,520
you know

718
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,620
hold on

719
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,419
sorry I wasn't sure if you wanted to

720
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,299
speak more uh I just so this came up in

721
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,500
another meeting this week too about

722
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,080
where a draft can can be considered a

723
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,240
specification as in per specification

724
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,500
required

725
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,539
so I'll take this to the IEC as a

726
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,460
discuss item because like like we need

727
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,039
to figure out but my view is that a

728
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,380
draft gets you at most an early

729
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,419
allocation and either your draft expires

730
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,279
and then your early allocation expires

731
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,460
or it becomes an RFC in which case you

732
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,120
are an RFC so I don't consider a draft a

733
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,279
publication in the sense of publication

734
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,500
required but I'm going to verify that

735
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,539
with the rest of the iuc so just to be

736
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,520
clear we litigated this last time when

737
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,640
we did it this particular RFC 8447 it's

738
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,799
like this was a point of discussion

739
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,600
and so we that's why the text is in

740
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,500
there about it could be an internet

741
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,480
draft that never gets published so it

742
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,940
literally can get published and expire

743
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,320
it's still available because it's

744
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,179
publicly available but it's not you know

745
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,620
quote unquote active you can still find

746
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,559
it in the repositories

747
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,700
so let's try yeah let's just try to

748
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,100
break apart two issues right one issue

749
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,600
is

750
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,539
um what the operational practice do we

751
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,740
want

752
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,360
um and the operational practices here to

753
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,220
four has been that you need to describe

754
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,440
the protocol and some level of detail in

755
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,120
some some document which like someone

756
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,799
could eventually see

757
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,440
um including an ID and that was the

758
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,400
consensus of working group in the

759
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,799
consensus of the ITF and if we like

760
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,299
wrote the wrong thing in the document

761
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,740
and like with the wrong thing then we're

762
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,120
like then we'll call this review instead

763
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,620
of specification or whatever like for

764
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,940
the IEC to tell us what to do on that

765
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,200
respect right that's already that's

766
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,760
already the way things are

767
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,740
um I think what we're discussing now is

768
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,600
a potential change change that policy

769
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,400
which does not require the description

770
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,340
of a full description thing at all right

771
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,419
um and David I think I just wanted to

772
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:37,260
like I saw you respond to what you're

773
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,419
saying which is like

774
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,860
um

775
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,419
I'm trying to thread a needle here which

776
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,220
is I would like people to document their

777
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,020
protocols and I wish people would do so

778
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,700
and I understand they may not and so I'm

779
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,020
trying to figure out and maybe I'm just

780
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,340
trying to be too clever but I'm trying

781
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,659
to figure out some way to sort of

782
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,220
vaguely encourage them to do so while

783
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,779
also not requiring it and again maybe

784
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,039
I'm just being too clever but that's

785
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,179
that's what I was trying to accomplish

786
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,980
with sort of okay an empty graph would

787
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,880
be okay

788
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,919
so I think it ends up being it but I

789
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:02,880
think what we're talking about is first

790
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,740
come first serve and then David asks a

791
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,779
designated expert for an unofficial

792
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:07,799
review

793
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,080
that's essentially because otherwise we

794
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,059
have to make a whole new process for

795
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,100
what we're talking about right yes I

796
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,900
mean like all of these are very well

797
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,480
defined in the INF policy RFC and I

798
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,419
expert review is fine and also for

799
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,559
expert review you can add uh a note that

800
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,080
is instructions to the experts that

801
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,260
shows up on the Anna page and say like a

802
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,720
specification is highly encouraged there

803
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,460
with forexpert review that might be the

804
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,200
simplest way to do this

805
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,580
um I mean just to be clear the purpose

806
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,559
the expert review in this like there

807
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,940
there seems to me that the purpose

808
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,520
expert review historically has been

809
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,559
it is a reasonable allocation size like

810
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,820
are you asking some ridiculous number

811
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,580
are you asking for a misleading name and

812
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,740
is the protocol specification like does

813
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,659
it kind of exist right and so what were

814
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,159
you talking about is relaxing that last

815
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,899
that last Point

816
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:00,419
um and I think you know I do I I think I

817
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,620
don't want I think Chris Davis just

818
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,600
because these are meaningful strings we

819
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,980
don't want to have entirely first come

820
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,179
first serve because we want to ensure

821
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,460
like that that the first instance that

822
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,840
someone doesn't register a string but

823
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,179
like just as highly misleading

824
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,559
um for I don't actually care less about

825
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,700
this for the numeric ones where someone

826
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,840
wants to register three you know

827
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,399
register you know three one three three

828
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,080
atom

829
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,460
prefix singers

830
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,159
I don't know

831
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,440
all right any any other

832
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,320
comments on this so you be if you want

833
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,600
to propose a PR that would be awesome

834
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,820
all right and then we can can review

835
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,240
that

836
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,220
any other uh Ayanna considerations

837
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,000
comments

838
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,520
all right so hopefully in a few weeks

839
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,039
we'll have a revision of this and

840
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,020
we might be able to take it to the last

841
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,279
call

842
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,500
I mean we'll we'll let Chris run that

843
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,480
since we're we're the two authors and it

844
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,220
would be wrong for us to do the I think

845
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,700
that's his call

846
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,120
so next

847
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
time

848
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,480
did you get it

849
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,279
do you want it

850
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,020
Nimrod do you want to share the slides

851
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,760
or would you like me to you can do it

852
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,559
through the share pre-loaded slides or I

853
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,980
can do it

854
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,159
yeah you're muted as well we can't hear

855
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,340
you

856
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,620
uh I've requested to share slides uh I

857
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,719
think I need your approval to do that

858
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,678
can you try to share again yeah sure

859
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,080
you can also run the slides if that's

860
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,279
easier oh

861
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,059
all right

862
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,299
here we go

863
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,980
all right

864
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,760
um

865
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,299
so my name is

866
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:26,039
Eric battle is also here

867
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,860
and we shall never stop on our quest to

868
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,960
defecate of Select key exchange methods

869
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,500
in TLS

870
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,380
uh this document is a working group item

871
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,440
for some time it deprecates RSA key

872
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,240
exchange in static finite Square DP

873
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,200
Airman

874
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
limits Finance field Defiance only in

875
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,200
its fully ephemeral form to groups large

876
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,480
enough to provide security

877
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,120
and discourages static elliptic curve

878
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,719
DVM

879
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,779
the only open issue is around groups in

880
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,520
ffdhe

881
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,500
uh discussions on the mailing list

882
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,720
concluded that uh

883
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,419
clients are unlikely to verify the group

884
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,840
structures and it's too expensive

885
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,840
uh there was also the suggestion of

886
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,320
creating a safe list for all safe groups

887
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,019
but that seems impractical or at least

888
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,960
unlikely to catch all safe groups on the

889
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,500
entire internet

890
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:28,980
so

891
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,419
asking clients to verify the group uh

892
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,299
oh about the connection if they can't is

893
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:39,260
unlikely to work

894
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,460
so for moving forward uh first we'd like

895
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,220
to discuss uh a reasonable suggestion

896
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,500
that was made but does not seem to have

897
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,940
consensus

898
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,740
several people have argued for

899
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,740
deprecating ffdhe entirely

900
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,200
and that is a reasonable position to

901
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,840
take but that does not appear to be

902
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,799
consensus for that

903
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:08,639
so uh in light of everything we said our

904
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,040
suggestion is to impose no requirement

905
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,060
around the group structure

906
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,859
and uh we'd like to question to what

907
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,800
extent this even matters so

908
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,699
web clients have already disabled ffdhea

909
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,980
and are not going to bring it back

910
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,918
email clients are not going to about

911
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,540
opportunistic TLS connections of a group

912
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,560
structure issues

913
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:34,739
um

914
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,520
and this single issue is the primary

915
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,099
thing holding back the drafts and

916
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:43,940
surround itf-113

917
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,159
so we recommend moving forward with this

918
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,599
compromise

919
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,940
it is a compromise but it really doesn't

920
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,060
matter much uh on the other hand

921
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,720
uh this issue is the primary reason

922
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,240
there is still no IDF document that

923
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,420
formally deprecates RSA key exchange and

924
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,760
deprecating RSA key exchange and other

925
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,920
absolutely exchange methods would matter

926
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,119
a lot

927
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,160
so we strongly recommend moving forward

928
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,040
with these suggestions

929
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,900
uh thanks and I'm happy to take

930
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,920
questions

931
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,079
so I guess to drive this issue forward

932
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,079
is there anyone that disagrees with the

933
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,960
way forward as suggested

934
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,180
we can do a poll and then take it to the

935
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,520
list but if nobody

936
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,500
I I don't know what what do we think is

937
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,640
the best way forward here maybe we

938
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,220
should just do a poll and get it on get

939
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,660
it on record and then we can take it to

940
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,700
the list for an actual consensus call to

941
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,960
kind of nail this

942
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,520
that sound good all right let me see if

943
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,920
I can work this whole thing

944
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,560
countdown clock event map where's the

945
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,920
pull show of hands tool

946
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,760
title

947
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,900
um Daniel would you like to

948
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,579
speak please go ahead

949
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,700
yeah hi there Daniel can Gilmore um so

950
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,040
I'm trying to understand uh over in the

951
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,180
chat

952
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,320
um

953
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,119
Europe asks a reasonable question about

954
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,040
who's the who's proposing deprecation

955
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,640
here and uh Ben Schwartz

956
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,380
well so I think the idea is that

957
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,599
opportunistic TLS clients you said email

958
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,920
clients here I'm pretty sure you meet

959
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,560
SMTP clients who are in opportunistic

960
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,339
mode

961
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,400
which is different than email clients

962
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,640
don't don't those same opportunistic

963
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,160
clients have the same concerns about all

964
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,440
the other key exchange applications I

965
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,220
mean

966
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,280
if you're doing opportunistic TLS surely

967
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,920
uh RSA key exchange is better than

968
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,339
nothing

969
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,160
um

970
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,520
so if that's the object if the objection

971
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,940
is coming from opportunistic clients who

972
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,260
would effectively fall back to clear

973
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,099
text

974
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:02,400
then I don't see why that complaint is

975
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,440
any different for

976
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,540
private field 50 element than it is for

977
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,460
anything else

978
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,660
so

979
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,520
you know your last question is who's uh

980
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,020
who's opposing the deprecation if the

981
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,760
opposition is coming from opportunistic

982
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,800
folks can we just make a carbot here and

983
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,240
say opportunistic clients can do

984
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
whatever they like

985
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,780
um and then go ahead with saying the

986
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,640
explicit deportation what's the like

987
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,440
who's who's actually blocking the

988
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,420
consensus I'm not saying bring anything

989
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,400
back I'm just saying obvious declines

990
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,960
are simply not going to do this right

991
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,880
they know that their fallback is clear

992
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,740
text they're not going to follow this

993
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,279
this guy

994
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,680
um so the opposition to full ffd

995
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,160
deprecation came uh mostly from uh I

996
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,200
think Victor dukovy uh Victor are you

997
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,540
here by any chance although uh should I

998
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,160
represent your position to the best on

999
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,640
viability

1000
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,040
uh all right I guess Victor isn't here

1001
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,700
so uh I think his take was that

1002
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,339
um

1003
00:38:01,339 --> 00:38:05,700
it's quite feasible for uh SMTP clients

1004
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,440
to deprecate RSA uh with their update

1005
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,200
cycle which is low and then we would get

1006
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,859
finite field DPM one is uh I don't know

1007
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:19,380
if the primary key exchange used in that

1008
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,440
ecosystem but like a a key exchange with

1009
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,780
like a noticeable market share

1010
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,060
and it would be with custom groups

1011
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,820
because of

1012
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,859
uh advised that uh

1013
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:35,040
was given to operators of of

1014
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,859
SMTP servers to generate their own

1015
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,660
custom groups

1016
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,079
I'm aware of that that situation I just

1017
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,000
don't understand why he'd be okay with

1018
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,099
accepting a deprecation of RSA key

1019
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,900
exchange as well

1020
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,700
because they they wouldn't have to fall

1021
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,339
back to clear text they they expect

1022
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:56,160
ffdhe is supposed to be widely prevalent

1023
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,079
I see this is what is preventing them

1024
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,520
from having to fall back to their decks

1025
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,900
to get the other stuff through and still

1026
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,700
claim to follow those gadgets

1027
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,460
I'm sorry could you repeat that okay the

1028
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,880
argument is as long as we have ffdhe to

1029
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,640
fall back to this is what allows us to

1030
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,320
deprecate RSA

1031
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,660
yeah yeah

1032
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,540
okay so what if we say opportunity can

1033
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,579
we can we do a kind of deprecation that

1034
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,740
says if your other choice is falling

1035
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,359
back to clear text if you will actively

1036
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,280
fall back to clear text that fdhd is

1037
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,780
okay

1038
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,900
if that also applies to the web

1039
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,660
that sounds there's no one on the web

1040
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,000
who does there's no one on the web who's

1041
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,820
willing to fall back to clear text

1042
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,500
uh

1043
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,359
do you know if you know the website

1044
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:43,440
that's willing to fall back to clear

1045
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,180
text for an https connection I would

1046
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,160
like to know

1047
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,960
will you just go up top and you delete

1048
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,000
the s

1049
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,940
the edit the URL I'm sure you can you

1050
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,560
can find a way to go alert somebody if

1051
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,359
they do that but I don't think that's

1052
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,680
relevant here

1053
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,920
yes so I'm not sure I'm familiar with uh

1054
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,660
the policies of all browsers on the

1055
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,619
matter but I think there are still some

1056
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:09,359
unencrypted web connections somewhere on

1057
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,700
the internet that's not that's how dkg

1058
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,500
is saying what dkg is saying is that the

1059
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,839
reference the reference in the URL tells

1060
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,578
you what you'd expect um tell us or not

1061
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,560
some browser will upgrade to https even

1062
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,500
if you type HTTP that's what that's what

1063
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,000
I was going to say is it turns out that

1064
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,920
the arc that there are browser settings

1065
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,500
now which will tempt https first and

1066
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,480
then we'll fall back to http

1067
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,880
um I think um I can just tell you we are

1068
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,160
not we would not be interested that that

1069
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,079
be that as it may we would not be

1070
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,640
interested in like supporting these

1071
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,500
other Suites

1072
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,599
um uh you know we wanna we're not with

1073
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,000
the same policy for every uh for for

1074
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,180
every uh connection because otherwise um

1075
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,740
I can tell you why if you really care

1076
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,300
but it's like really nice it's about the

1077
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,500
web security model and it's not really

1078
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,579
that interesting

1079
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:03,420
um but um but I think more generally I'd

1080
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,619
like to understand the scope of the

1081
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,720
problem here like how many if we just

1082
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,119
were to say like

1083
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,119
you know if if if we if we were to like

1084
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,680
have a requirement that was a

1085
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,420
requirement structure

1086
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,980
um how many connections how many things

1087
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,540
would really go from like in groups of

1088
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,400
divine text and if the answer was small

1089
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,900
I'm going to go back to good government

1090
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,220
and ecosystem again which would be

1091
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,300
better if everybody's doing good things

1092
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,540
so

1093
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,579
sure how big is the scope with so

1094
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,320
imagine we were to like deprecate ffd

1095
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,200
entirely just as a is a strong counter

1096
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,700
example as a strong point

1097
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,320
how many connections would go from

1098
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,920
encrypted to clear text what fraction

1099
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,099
I think email clients like sntp clients

1100
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:47,700
would probably ignore the deprecation no

1101
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,260
but imagine they didn't imagine they

1102
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,540
didn't ah so uh according to Victor uh

1103
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,700
uh much of the email ecosystem would

1104
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,300
stop being encrypted in transit uh

1105
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,740
what's much

1106
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,119
five percent ten percent

1107
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:10,740
I did try to

1108
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,780
interest people who are good in

1109
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,940
generating these statistics

1110
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,520
um but I haven't had such luck so I

1111
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,400
guess my position is like this is

1112
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,960
we're not going to send people out to

1113
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,280
like people's houses and make them turn

1114
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,040
off design for sweets or in the data

1115
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,119
centers

1116
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,740
um I mean you know I will be over it

1117
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,079
I'll be over you know send grid later

1118
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,060
but uh I'll just take care of that um

1119
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,760
but I mean more seriously like so like

1120
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,619
we our point is to require people to do

1121
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:43,260
smart things and if like people and and

1122
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,960
like

1123
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,839
we I think the policy the ietf is we'd

1124
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:50,520
like people to transition from finite

1125
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,900
field to helmet to elliptic curve to

1126
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,880
feel and

1127
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,680
um and so

1128
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,880
if

1129
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,619
Ryan's are trying to like create this

1130
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,540
like intense negotiation about exactly

1131
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,400
what tests we should say we should tell

1132
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,020
people not to do this the thing we think

1133
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,839
is bad and then like the email guy's

1134
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,000
gonna ignore it for a while and or they

1135
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,800
don't ignore it but like

1136
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,079
like our positions they should do

1137
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,640
something in particular and now I'm not

1138
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,680
like I'm I'm a little unclear what the

1139
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,819
options are and exactly what

1140
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:19,020
recommendation we should make we should

1141
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,520
make the right recommendation and not

1142
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,020
make a silly recommendation just because

1143
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,160
some people are behind

1144
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,880
um the other thing is that if we tell if

1145
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,520
we if we tell clients do not negotiate

1146
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,440
find a field of the element and there

1147
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,839
are some SMTP servers that do that and

1148
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:39,960
anybody is running SMTP servers that is

1149
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,319
when they act as as SMTP clients

1150
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:46,200
they do disable that all of the servers

1151
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,119
that are the old ones that we are scared

1152
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:49,740
about suddenly dropping our connections

1153
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,359
to codex will see their percentage of

1154
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,180
fair text connections go down

1155
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,400
if they're looking at the stats if they

1156
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,380
care and they see those things go down

1157
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,440
they'll say okay we need to add the

1158
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,680
cards if you helmet I mean

1159
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,599
if this is black like

1160
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,000
the other thing so Ecker thank you for

1161
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,339
your your observation of the https only

1162
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:13,619
or https preferred modes for browsers

1163
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:15,480
those modes should be Universal as far

1164
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,740
as I'm concerned

1165
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,960
if we make the text say

1166
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,099
you know

1167
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:23,640
must not accept finite field home and

1168
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,420
key exchange unless uh but uh in in

1169
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,900
standard TLS mode in optimistic mode May

1170
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,240
accept ffdhe that doesn't require

1171
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,560
browsers to accept ffdhe in in their

1172
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,900
uh mode it just gives a carve out so

1173
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,680
that

1174
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,200
SMTP clients like Victor's are willing

1175
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,160
you know who are clenching at the nfdhe

1176
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,020
straws for their five percent of

1177
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,119
whatever their connections are like

1178
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,560
like it just seems that that is at least

1179
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,400
a clearer statement

1180
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,460
uh I agree with that Generation

1181
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,680
Um like I say even I don't speak for any

1182
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,060
other browser

1183
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,880
um um but like I can't see us

1184
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,680
um I can't see us doing

1185
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,540
um like I can't see us apply in

1186
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,740
different policy optimistic versus

1187
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,180
optimistic mode

1188
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,339
um because like I say the the those are

1189
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:15,660
the same origin and so if you do that

1190
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,900
the security properties get very weird

1191
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,660
all right Martin please go ahead

1192
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,619
yeah so um I think I think the the split

1193
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:28,020
the dkg just articulated is probably the

1194
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,099
right one

1195
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,140
um I don't I don't actually see what we

1196
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,660
do in browsers and they sort of forced

1197
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,900
upgrades to https or opportunistic

1198
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,760
upgrades as to TLS really as being an

1199
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,040
opportunistic mode at all we're just

1200
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,319
um we're just applying the same policies

1201
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,900
that we would for https anyway

1202
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,819
um so

1203
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:50,880
I think I think the the sort of email

1204
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,920
opportunistic security stuff

1205
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,780
can get a little bit of a free pass on

1206
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,060
these things but um

1207
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,920
I'm sort of

1208
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,619
on the on the in the sort of direction

1209
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:04,859
of saying well put your requirements on

1210
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,200
the groups or whatever validation that

1211
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,160
you can and then um say that you can if

1212
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,720
you're doing an opportunistic mode you

1213
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,440
can

1214
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,119
you can do anything you like really at

1215
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,040
that point it seems to be Victor's

1216
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,020
attitude towards the um

1217
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,140
to the use of opportunistic TLS he'd be

1218
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,900
happy with rock 13.

1219
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,839
uh I'm sorry so you're saying

1220
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,300
uh you're not saying deprecate ffdhe

1221
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,720
entirely are you you're saying

1222
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,880
move forward with group structure

1223
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,560
requirements but but those are

1224
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,099
interactable or at least they seem to be

1225
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,800
uh do I have your position correct

1226
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,140
so I'm I'm essentially saying that we

1227
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,060
leave we leave the curve out if you if

1228
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,160
you don't care about security as a

1229
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,500
baseline then we don't really care what

1230
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,260
you do in the in with respect to this

1231
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,660
particular requirement

1232
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,780
which I think is what dkg was saying

1233
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,140
yes so just to make sure I understand

1234
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,900
where are we going with this discussion

1235
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,540
so the suggestion is to

1236
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,319
uh have the most stringent requirement

1237
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,599
uh

1238
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,540
applied to non-operogeneistic DLS

1239
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,800
connections

1240
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,640
um and for opportunistic connections

1241
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,359
basically yellow

1242
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:29,460
uh if if I didn't get that correctly

1243
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,859
please correct me ah you have please go

1244
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:34,040
ahead

1245
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,579
yes so um my my suggestion is just

1246
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:42,060
deprecated entirely and if

1247
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,099
if somebody can't stand it then they

1248
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:46,020
don't then they don't comply with the

1249
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,020
new RFC and we've had this before and

1250
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,420
if they can't if they can't get there I

1251
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,760
mean if you're using open SSL then

1252
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,740
you're then you're fine anyway because

1253
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,400
it has had the ecdh essence I know

1254
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,920
version one and

1255
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,540
um if you're using something worse than

1256
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,400
openssl then you should be using

1257
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,079
something at least as good as open as

1258
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:09,260
yourself

1259
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,960
all right

1260
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,640
um okay so number and I just wanted to

1261
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,619
double check I know that dkg is offered

1262
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:19,380
to put uh synopsis of what he proposed

1263
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,060
in the text for all of us because up

1264
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,500
here the audio is pretty horrible so I'm

1265
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,359
not sure I caught all of it but Nimrod

1266
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,220
do you have a good a good feel for the

1267
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,640
way forward

1268
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,220
um

1269
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,819
so

1270
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,020
one of my forward is to move with our

1271
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,480
suggestion uh and just be done with it

1272
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,760
but I I think that's not the consensus

1273
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,040
of this discussion uh the consensus of

1274
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,920
this discussion is

1275
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,700
um

1276
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,480
for a non-opportunistic TLS connections

1277
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,060
deprecate ffdhe entirely or require

1278
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,819
anything that is necessary to make it

1279
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:59,940
safe that would include group structure

1280
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,359
for opportunistic TLS connections

1281
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,760
uh

1282
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,280
uh either

1283
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,300
um

1284
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,700
that that

1285
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,680
other you can do whatever you want or

1286
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,380
you can fall back to ffdhe without any

1287
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,000
requirements

1288
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,900
I think that was the gist of it

1289
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,460
uh

1290
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,920
Ecker would you like to speak

1291
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,180
how about Kyle

1292
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,839
okay yeah sure kind of efforts um I'm a

1293
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,520
little worried if we start to have this

1294
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,099
carve out for opportunistic clients here

1295
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,200
um where is this going to end I mean

1296
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,180
you could use say this for pretty much

1297
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,680
every single issue

1298
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,540
um what about any kind of specific

1299
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,540
validation of any kind of uh guidance

1300
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,859
we've ever

1301
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:50,640
um

1302
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,040
any protocolvers and

1303
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,040
um ciphers and

1304
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,400
I'm not sure why this specific issue is

1305
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,380
somewhere where we should makes a

1306
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,740
specific carve out

1307
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,460
um

1308
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,579
as opposed to recognizing that this is

1309
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:10,859
probably an issue that the opportunity

1310
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:12,599
clients are it's going to decide not to

1311
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:15,920
follow a recommendation anyway

1312
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:19,440
yeah I I agree with God

1313
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,980
uh also there's a this would beg the

1314
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,740
question of what counts as opportunistic

1315
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,500
so if there's like a

1316
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,960
a credit card processing or anything

1317
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,760
like that does that count as

1318
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,920
opportunistic

1319
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,500
so I think we're opening up the

1320
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,680
Pandora's Box to be honest

1321
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,859
uh but uh yeah David uh please go ahead

1322
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:48,240
uh David skanazi consensus Enthusiast

1323
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,140
um so just for future reference I highly

1324
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:55,380
urge you to never you know put no

1325
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,900
consensus on your slides because you're

1326
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,760
just like kind of painting yourself in a

1327
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,980
corner and either way it's the chair's

1328
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,020
job to declare if there is consensus or

1329
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,940
not so I'm gonna do something that's

1330
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,859
both gonna help and be a pain in the ass

1331
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:10,859
you're welcome uh I'm gonna say that

1332
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,960
this opportunistic thing I don't like it

1333
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,200
and I'm strongly opposed to it

1334
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,720
there so now number two is also no

1335
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,400
consensus

1336
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,900
um so we can go back to looking at

1337
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,059
option one which might become a rough

1338
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,220
consensus if there are only a small

1339
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,500
number of people who don't like it so

1340
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,359
I'm just trying to help fair enough so I

1341
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:31,980
mean I think the point here is that we

1342
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,480
haven't actually done a formal consensus

1343
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,339
call it's just been kind of the author's

1344
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,960
kind of reading the tea leaves for all

1345
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,760
the mail list if we're stuck on this

1346
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,260
point and in a deadlock and we have to

1347
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,660
pull up the heavyweight consensus email

1348
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,420
do all that stuff we can do that I just

1349
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,460
need the words that I'm going to put in

1350
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,800
the consensus call and so we can work to

1351
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,480
try to get those

1352
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,240
um and actually get that going

1353
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,220
so what I would personally propose and

1354
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,900
of course it is the chair's preview to

1355
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,359
decide is to say

1356
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:03,660
option one like do we have consensus on

1357
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,119
deprecating entirely and I would

1358
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:07,800
encourage anyone in the room who

1359
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,660
disagrees with deprecated entirely to

1360
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,859
please come and state why

1361
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:16,380
so we can we can actually do that via

1362
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,240
the this is there's two reasons I want

1363
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,800
to get you to log into the tool because

1364
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,619
one it determines room size so next time

1365
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:24,119
we're not in some tiny rooms sweating

1366
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:27,119
our you know spreading our faces off so

1367
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,440
we could actually do that and do a

1368
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,720
general Poll for if there's any any get

1369
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,339
a sense of the room of whether or not

1370
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:35,339
there's any objections to deprecating

1371
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:37,500
ffdhe

1372
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,119
so

1373
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,200
um John Thompson I think that the

1374
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,339
arguments I've heard since I last stood

1375
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:47,480
up here pushed me towards option one

1376
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,579
deprecate ffdhe entirely

1377
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:54,300
option two deprecate ffe without the the

1378
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,359
good groups which is a weak second

1379
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,220
because it requires a lot more text and

1380
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,380
is a little bit more vague

1381
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,599
I don't think we need to do anything for

1382
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,059
opportunistic clients David Benjamin

1383
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:09,599
found a quote from RFC 7435 which is the

1384
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,300
opportunistic security

1385
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,280
RFC that sort of talks about it and that

1386
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,859
basically says that if you

1387
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:17,720
um

1388
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,119
an opportunistic protocol May employ

1389
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,040
more liberal settings than would be best

1390
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,720
practiced when security is mandated by

1391
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,240
policy so basically

1392
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,400
they're already in this sort of carve

1393
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,900
out and

1394
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,819
someone who wants to do this can ignore

1395
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:35,460
this RFC that we publish now and follow

1396
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,140
the other one and everything's fine

1397
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,660
because they're doing opportunistic and

1398
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,059
that's that's totally cool so option one

1399
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:43,559
is depreciate what did you say option

1400
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:46,800
two again was uh just deprecate the the

1401
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,220
um the non the the groups that are not

1402
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,780
known as good

1403
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,880
which is

1404
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,800
not great

1405
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,599
um but I would I would certainly be in

1406
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,900
the in the option one Camp here

1407
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,460
the

1408
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,319
so and there was no third option so it's

1409
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,599
it would be and there is no third option

1410
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:08,760
as far as I'm concerned I I don't think

1411
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,380
we need to

1412
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,500
[Music]

1413
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,440
take the suggestion here that we was

1414
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,760
floated originally I don't think there's

1415
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,559
a there's any good outcome from that

1416
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:21,359
so I I think there are at least three

1417
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,579
options but uh

1418
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:26,700
so we can deprecate ffdg entirely

1419
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,619
we can allow ffdhe only with

1420
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:35,960
standardized groups and we can allow

1421
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,540
ffdhe with any safe group

1422
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:43,880
uh or we can allow ffdhg with any group

1423
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,099
large enough without requiring anything

1424
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:48,839
about group structure so that's actually

1425
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:51,480
at least four options that I'm aware of

1426
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,460
but I think we're going towards

1427
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,800
deprecating ffdh entirely

1428
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,200
uh to be honest I wasn't aware of the

1429
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,970
RFC quoted mating uh where opportunistic

1430
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:03,480
[Music]

1431
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,640
settings May employ more liberal

1432
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,579
policies uh that sounds like a good way

1433
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,800
forward to me

1434
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,220
um but yeah uh Stephen please go ahead

1435
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,740
all right Stephen Farrell uh so I I

1436
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,319
don't actually disagree with David on

1437
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,180
this really but I know that people do

1438
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,220
including Victor and he usually has some

1439
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,900
good arguments so I don't think it would

1440
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,940
be really correct to say we don't have

1441
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,640
any of the room today who disagrees I'm

1442
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,380
not saying you said that I'm just saying

1443
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,180
we should we shouldn't do that yeah so I

1444
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,079
think what I'm going to do is we're

1445
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,280
going to do a poll since the room and

1446
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,240
we'll have to take it to the mailing

1447
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,700
list again it's not it's because we know

1448
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,020
Victor's not here and I know he's going

1449
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,000
to have strenuous objections so yeah and

1450
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,819
and recent ones so and then the only

1451
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:45,900
other thing I wanted to say was I don't

1452
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,640
think option two is is I know there's

1453
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,079
any point in option two

1454
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,220
because

1455
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,200
as far as I know it's only Victor and

1456
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,200
that kind of you know set of deployments

1457
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,640
he's discussing

1458
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,319
that have an issue and they generally

1459
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:59,520
use custom groups so I don't think

1460
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,099
option two gets us anywhere

1461
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:03,599
so option two being just have a safe

1462
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,700
list of groups

1463
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,160
that's not often doing in this line

1464
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,599
right but okay

1465
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,819
no option two as in uh Martin's option

1466
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:14,160
two ah all right all right I don't need

1467
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,420
any point and started saying you know

1468
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,640
it's so yeah so I think throw that one

1469
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,319
away and don't ask Apollo about that I

1470
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:21,680
would suggest

1471
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:22,980
yeah

1472
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,960
all right

1473
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,619
um

1474
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:28,140
anyone else wants to speak Echo

1475
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,220
yeah

1476
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,920
um so I I'm also concerned about the

1477
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,119
viability of option two for the reason

1478
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,680
Stephen is which I suspect it will

1479
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,180
actually not work

1480
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,619
um

1481
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:38,280
um

1482
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,359
um if someone showed me a measurement

1483
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,040
that would work I might feel differently

1484
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,540
so let's take a measurement and be like

1485
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,460
no actually all these guys use one of

1486
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,020
the defined groups then you know maybe

1487
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,460
that feels differently

1488
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,780
um but I suspect that it's not going to

1489
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,920
be false

1490
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,660
um the um

1491
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,859
I I guess uh

1492
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,180
um I mean I think you know the there

1493
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,500
seems to see some question there's a

1494
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,579
discussion on a chat about whether there

1495
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:01,740
already is enough of a carve out in the

1496
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,020
opportunity descriptions to Simply a

1497
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,940
honesty a must like

1498
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,099
I would I mean I can take this list but

1499
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:10,440
I would strongly prefer not to have like

1500
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,420
some weird explicit like opt out here

1501
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,780
like the purp like like the like again

1502
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,900
the instructions like we have how long

1503
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,640
did it take between like when we when we

1504
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,319
like said banned rc4 and we actually

1505
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,599
turned off our G4 I mean like like

1506
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:27,059
basically like every decade yeah we like

1507
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:28,260
routinely

1508
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,359
we like routinely pass these these these

1509
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:31,859
deprecations and then actually take

1510
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:33,420
quite a while to execute them

1511
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,859
on the purpose of deprecations is a

1512
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:36,599
single to people the way they should

1513
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:37,500
behave

1514
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,280
and that we're trying and so and like if

1515
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,319
and and I think it ought to be the

1516
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:45,839
position of this group that even

1517
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,000
opportunistic people should use good

1518
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,880
savers and that may not currently be

1519
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,200
practical but that's what they should do

1520
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:56,339
and we wish they would and so like the

1521
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,260
carve out for them is a the text in the

1522
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,940
previous document and B they can ignore

1523
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,119
us

1524
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,740
and to quickly add to what Ecker said

1525
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,960
just gonna tell a quick story that is

1526
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,900
mainly Chris Wood's story but um he's

1527
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,839
enjoying his vacation go ahead

1528
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,119
um back I used to work at Apple with him

1529
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,859
at the time when the working group

1530
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:22,940
deprecated tls-10 and tls11

1531
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:25,559
and he actually did all the work to

1532
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:27,780
removing like disable it from our

1533
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,660
general boring SSL code at the time

1534
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,160
uh

1535
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,280
and it blew up I forget if it was a male

1536
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,000
thing or an EP TLS thing or one of those

1537
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,460
things that like there's a box somewhere

1538
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,380
that hasn't been updated since I was

1539
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,299
born kind of thing

1540
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:46,319
um

1541
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,420
and that didn't mean we opposed

1542
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,579
publishing the RFC it just means that

1543
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:52,619
like that we had a thing there but we

1544
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:54,780
didn't add any text about that silly box

1545
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,299
we the the that code ignored the

1546
00:58:57,299 --> 00:58:59,099
recommendation everything was fine so

1547
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:00,720
deprecating even if there are people

1548
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,579
that can't today is fine I'm just very

1549
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:05,760
strongly agreeing with Ecker

1550
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,380
I forgot the one more thing I wanted to

1551
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,940
say but um which I agree what you just

1552
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,460
said um which is that

1553
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:15,119
the purpose of this document in in of

1554
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,559
this this requirement in the context of

1555
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,960
opportunistic is to tell people in that

1556
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,700
ecosystem that they ought to be changing

1557
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,220
so that in a year they can turn it off

1558
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,900
and if we have an explicit carbon for

1559
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,640
opportunity the consequence of that is

1560
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,319
that they hear we don't have to change

1561
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,119
and so five years from another situation

1562
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:31,440
the ecosystem is unchanged and they

1563
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,380
still can't turn it off so so that's

1564
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,819
that's the reason not to have a car

1565
00:59:35,819 --> 00:59:36,960
problems I mean that was part of why we

1566
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,540
did rc4 right like we did the rc4 draft

1567
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,799
because people were like please if you

1568
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,119
write something I can then go whack

1569
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:43,859
people over the head and get it changed

1570
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:46,020
so all right so I think what we've come

1571
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,460
down to we've had lots of suggestions

1572
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,480
for

1573
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,740
um various polls we're going to do a

1574
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,359
simple one which is do you support

1575
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,359
deprecating ffdhd

1576
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:57,900
um so please get to the uh feed Echo

1577
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,119
tool you will raise your hands if you

1578
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:03,559
support and you will not if you don't

1579
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,359
start it

1580
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,720
oh if you're seeing the uh

1581
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,760
rocketing live things and again we're

1582
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,900
taking this back to the list

1583
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:28,680
so there's 93 people in the uh

1584
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,200
room as you might be able to see and

1585
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,660
we've got about 30

1586
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:36,618
35-ish people

1587
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,980
give it another minute

1588
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,559
uh would you like to speak

1589
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,759
hey John

1590
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,720
yeah go ahead if you've uh Richard

1591
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,940
are you remote I think you might have to

1592
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,140
come off

1593
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,420
all right so I think we got

1594
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,400
enough here so for the for the minutes

1595
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,940
it was 39 participants 34 raised hands

1596
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,619
and five do not raise hands

1597
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,900
all right so uh it sounds like we're

1598
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,079
moving towards deprecating it entirely

1599
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:21,960
um and I guess we take it to the list to

1600
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,359
get a Battlefield

1601
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:26,579
so I think that the action item is

1602
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,319
actually going to be on the chairs not

1603
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,319
on you so we will uh figure out the

1604
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:32,760
right phraseology to get this

1605
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,040
conversation going and I look forward to

1606
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,000
a

1607
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,160
polite yet Lively conversation on the

1608
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,420
mailing list

1609
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,520
all right I will be available if you'd

1610
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,440
like to consult me on the phrase analogy

1611
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,020
uh also Daniel would you like to speak

1612
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,119
again yeah sorry

1613
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:49,020
um

1614
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,059
I don't think that this poll was

1615
01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:53,400
sufficient to say the move is towards

1616
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,619
deprecating it entirely like I raised my

1617
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:57,359
hand to say it I'm fine with deprecated

1618
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,400
entirely and I'm also fine with saying

1619
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,920
deprecate everything but a small list of

1620
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,540
known groups

1621
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:07,020
right I mean yeah fair enough uh dkg I

1622
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,000
think the the point is we want to at

1623
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,920
least have some place to start but we

1624
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,420
want us we want a strong we want a

1625
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,220
strong deprecation statement of some of

1626
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,099
some sort yeah yes that's that's really

1627
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:19,700
what that was

1628
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,180
all right thank you thank you nimrod

1629
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,379
we'll go through our next president

1630
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,460
all right so I think we're on to our

1631
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:36,619
next presentation which I believe is

1632
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:39,420
I've forgotten now

1633
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,339
I think it's Martin but I'm not sure

1634
01:02:47,299 --> 01:02:50,339
sorry let me look at the actual agenda

1635
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:52,079
I think it is more I think it's Martin

1636
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,900
come on scruffing no it's Stephen oh

1637
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:59,520
Steven Steven the ech config list

1638
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,880
and this draft is significantly changed

1639
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,640
this is this is a uh this this is how

1640
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,900
you can adopt a working group draft

1641
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,720
without getting it done before you adopt

1642
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,940
it so I'm hoping the band joins the and

1643
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,559
since audio and video because this is

1644
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:15,619
kind of the banned version of the draft

1645
01:03:15,619 --> 01:03:18,780
there he is great there he is great so

1646
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,819
I'm only Ben would present this if he

1647
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:22,140
was here but uh

1648
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,140
uh and do jump in Ben if you if you want

1649
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,700
to correctly so the base what we did was

1650
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,520
we had some discussion and Ben and Rich

1651
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,680
uh agreed to help co-author

1652
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,079
so what we did in this version is

1653
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,960
essentially try out to see if some of

1654
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,000
the ideas of Ben and Richard uh mostly

1655
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,220
Ben I think uh are something that the

1656
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,260
working group find better and so this is

1657
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,119
a suggestion we're not

1658
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,559
we're willing to roll it back if people

1659
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,240
prefer the zero zero version

1660
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,700
so zero zero basically described

1661
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,920
something I did and in a very small kind

1662
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,339
of test deployment whereas Ben and Rich

1663
01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:58,200
are familiar with real deployments which

1664
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,780
is kind of useful so draft one I think

1665
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:04,079
has been extended and to try and

1666
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,180
cater for a broader range of deployments

1667
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,859
in particular I guess the ones Ben is

1668
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:09,119
thinking about

1669
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,880
it's not implemented and if people tell

1670
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,160
us this is this just is totally smelly

1671
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,380
then we'll happily roll it back next

1672
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,420
slide

1673
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,619
so the background is same as last time

1674
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:23,180
ech

1675
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,859
requires you to publish a key in a

1676
01:04:25,859 --> 01:04:27,480
config list and the DNS

1677
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,540
and I think one of Ben's goals is to try

1678
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,280
and

1679
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,859
do more in this version to avoid anybody

1680
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:37,859
cutting and pasting those values

1681
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:40,680
um so uh and but yes people will rotate

1682
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,540
keys so we need somebody to handle it

1683
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:46,020
and dynamically generate zones

1684
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,520
um and yeah so so yeah again another

1685
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,960
thing Ben wants he wanted to make it

1686
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,599
easier to do it

1687
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:53,220
a good way than the wrong way so next

1688
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,200
slide

1689
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,980
so uh what's different in this one is

1690
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,500
in zero zero you were talking to the ech

1691
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,319
front end essentially to get the ech

1692
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,500
config that the the zone

1693
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,799
the authoritative for the origin was

1694
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,540
talking to the ech front end to get the

1695
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,280
ech key and then to put it into the

1696
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,720
origins Zone

1697
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,460
in this one it's talking to the origin

1698
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:20,280
itself because that allows

1699
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,140
covering kind of more deployment cases

1700
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,000
that Ben thinks are interesting which is

1701
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,160
I think true

1702
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,500
um and it otherwise it's kind of similar

1703
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,180
that you're publishing a blob or Json

1704
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,540
added up well known which allows the

1705
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,579
Zone Factory to construct the relevant

1706
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:37,680
resource records

1707
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,619
next slide

1708
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:41,760
jump in and correct me if I say

1709
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,680
something wrong here so this is the

1710
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,640
picture uh for this one where we have

1711
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,440
the Zone Factory which creates the

1712
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,740
resource records and write some DNS it

1713
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,540
has to occasionally fetch values because

1714
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,940
keys are being rotated

1715
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,339
um and the origin in this case might

1716
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:01,619
have to talk to the ech front end

1717
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:04,500
because uh that's where the the ech keys

1718
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,480
are actually being generated

1719
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,700
and so what you could think of is that

1720
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,400
the bottom part there in lighter blue

1721
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,520
is draft zero

1722
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,339
sort of whereas and then in this draft

1723
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:19,319
because you're going to the origin you

1724
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:20,640
can do a bit more

1725
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,220
so next slide

1726
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:24,720
and then there's a comparison between

1727
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,319
you know Json blobs and again I think we

1728
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,640
have no problem changing these in any

1729
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,960
particular way because they're they're

1730
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,940
pretty sketchy at the minute but

1731
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,260
basically it allows you to have the same

1732
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,619
kind of information

1733
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,240
next slide json's not that interesting

1734
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,740
and then these are the kind of https

1735
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,180
aurors

1736
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:45,119
that you might end up with uh

1737
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,339
I'm not entirely sure I know even I even

1738
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:48,960
know what a template horror is but I

1739
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,339
could kind of guess but I'm not sure how

1740
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,079
accurate that guest would be

1741
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,760
um but in any case the Zone Factory can

1742
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,520
use the Json to make resource records

1743
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,859
next slide

1744
01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:01,200
this is the thing that's kind of new is

1745
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,400
that

1746
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,200
uh Ben I think rightly points out that

1747
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,319
the the draft zero kind of handles a

1748
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:08,880
like the kind of weird case that I was

1749
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,099
interested in for my test sites

1750
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:13,079
um probably many more people will just

1751
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:16,200
use a c name or something and he wanted

1752
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,760
to provide a way to make that a bit

1753
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,460
easier and a bit less error prone and so

1754
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,380
that's kind of the main reason why you

1755
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,059
want to talk to the origin I guess

1756
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:25,859
um so that's kind of a nice thing about

1757
01:07:25,859 --> 01:07:27,960
it is that you can just create a Json

1758
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,180
blog but then eventually turns into a c

1759
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:34,079
name or one of the other ways of editing

1760
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,180
um which I think is nice on the other

1761
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,500
hand it also kind of feels a bit

1762
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,440
dangerous but I'm not quite sure why

1763
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,160
um

1764
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,559
but nonetheless this this version that

1765
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,119
I've envisages supporting that kind of

1766
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:46,619
use case

1767
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:48,660
which I guess would be by far the most

1768
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:51,660
common way of doing this uh but I don't

1769
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,140
know for sure

1770
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,420
I'm just pausing there in case Ben wants

1771
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,680
to add something or somebody wants to

1772
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:02,039
scream that this is mad for some reason

1773
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:05,160
nobody's screaming okay next slide

1774
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,960
uh this still has the kind of support

1775
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,020
for the multi-cdn I you know I I

1776
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,640
wouldn't say we put a huge amount of

1777
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,900
work into this it probably needs a bit

1778
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,339
more thought a bit more working out and

1779
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:15,599
playing around to try and make it work

1780
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,420
uh but it should work I think uh

1781
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,580
basically where you can you can pick up

1782
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:22,259
these CH keys

1783
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:24,359
uh from the cgn and then put them on the

1784
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:25,259
origin

1785
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:27,000
it's essentially this is like saying

1786
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,219
that you know do the draft zero thing

1787
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:31,620
between the origin and the CDN and then

1788
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,719
you'd use this to get the resource

1789
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:34,920
records created so it's a little bit of

1790
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,120
a two-step thing

1791
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,380
uh put your work

1792
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:42,379
next slide

1793
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:46,439
Ben prefers I had you know in version

1794
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:49,439
zero we had ttls in the Json uh Ben

1795
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:52,380
prefers to use HTTP freshness

1796
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,859
I don't know if that makes sense uh if I

1797
01:08:55,859 --> 01:08:57,420
have a very simple kind of script that

1798
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,160
just uses Coral or something to pull

1799
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,080
these things I'm not sure how easy it is

1800
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,580
to get that but I haven't looked so

1801
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,779
maybe you can

1802
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:07,198
and again we you know I think as before

1803
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,698
it was pretty clear that people didn't

1804
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:10,500
want ordinary kind of clients for ech

1805
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,738
using these URLs so we should discourage

1806
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:15,839
us

1807
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,439
next slide

1808
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:20,880
uh yeah this template stuff for that we

1809
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,259
figured out

1810
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,399
uh

1811
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:25,140
uh there's probably with this version

1812
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,520
yeah there's probably some things about

1813
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,080
IP addresses and so on that might get

1814
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,460
tricky

1815
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:30,660
um

1816
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,399
I don't know I don't know what support

1817
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,160
for non-hps protocols means here but I

1818
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,359
don't know if I've been had mine when he

1819
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:38,399
put that bullet in and I guess some

1820
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:39,779
other HTTP things might have to be

1821
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:40,679
thought about

1822
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:43,679
all right uh hi thank you Ben

1823
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,660
okay uh yeah I I mean um uses of ech and

1824
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:53,179
TLS for things other than http

1825
01:09:53,299 --> 01:09:55,020
okay

1826
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,360
but what what did you have like Quake or

1827
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,040
something in mind or what some example

1828
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,280
or

1829
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,460
so last year even though I'm doing very

1830
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,440
badly presenting bands ideas I'm it's a

1831
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,060
good job I'm here so there you go uh

1832
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,080
yeah there's a bunch of things we

1833
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,219
figured out

1834
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:12,540
um so

1835
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,640
next slide I think is the last one is

1836
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,540
this okay that's that's the question uh

1837
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,940
it's well okay what do you think I mean

1838
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:22,920
you know do people have opinions

1839
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,620
um it might be a little bit can we ask

1840
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,239
how many people actually read the the

1841
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:29,640
this version of the draft

1842
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,739
yeah

1843
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:33,239
I see a couple of hands up there good

1844
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:35,100
and then well I'll be honest one of the

1845
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,300
reasons why I was concerned about this

1846
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,980
draft being in this working group is

1847
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,540
there weren't a lot of DNS people but at

1848
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,580
least there's a couple of people around

1849
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,960
here I know that are really smart about

1850
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,780
this stuff so don't be bashful now's

1851
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,120
your chance to learn

1852
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,940
so if people have any immediate

1853
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,020
reactions that would be useful because

1854
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,100
we're you know we're not it's not that

1855
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,000
this is something we're terribly

1856
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,679
invested in we're just we're looking for

1857
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,540
is this a better Direction than what was

1858
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,880
in Drive zero do you don't care

1859
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,280
so from a personal perspective I think

1860
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,080
it's it's better if we have a wider

1861
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,320
deployments in mind right so better

1862
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,300
better uh it's better if we have wider

1863
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,719
deployments in mind okay

1864
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,159
um any other feedback

1865
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:18,540
okay

1866
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,280
yeah I mean I think it's you know

1867
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,500
personally I I we need to be we kind of

1868
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,900
did this in the last few weeks so we we

1869
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,340
need to do more work on our treaty as

1870
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,460
well

1871
01:11:28,739 --> 01:11:31,519
Ben did you

1872
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,719
uh yeah so

1873
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:36,960
uh okay sorry yeah my Miracle has not

1874
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,300
been stable for me this week the uh

1875
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:46,140
the the template thing is an attempt to

1876
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,719
balance this competing these competing

1877
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,580
desires on the one hand we're trying to

1878
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:54,300
stick to only talking about ech and

1879
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,360
information you need to know to make use

1880
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,120
of an ech config

1881
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,460
and on the other hand the ultimately

1882
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,940
your HTTP your your Zone Factory is

1883
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:07,980
going to produce DNS records that have a

1884
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,780
bunch of other stuff in them that are

1885
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,120
telling you things like uh does the

1886
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,239
support HTTP 3 you know is this actually

1887
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:18,480
something about oblivious though like

1888
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,920
all this

1889
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,040
um uh all this different metadata about

1890
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,159
the origin and so we said you know let's

1891
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:30,360
focus on ech here and and leave that to

1892
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,360
the DNS side so that that means the Zone

1893
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,159
Factory has to know all this other stuff

1894
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:37,679
in advance all we're doing is is moving

1895
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,320
the ech keys across but then you need a

1896
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,239
matching algorithm you need some way to

1897
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,159
say well okay I've got I've got several

1898
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,960
endpoints with different ech Keys which

1899
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,880
one goes into which of those records and

1900
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,920
so that's that's sort of the templating

1901
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,760
idea here

1902
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,540
David

1903
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:01,560
hi David's kanazi DNS Enthusiast

1904
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,120
um first I think the more generic

1905
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,760
approach I I like it

1906
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,980
um just conceptually having a way to do

1907
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:11,159
this sounds good the so first a

1908
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:13,199
clarifying question

1909
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,940
how is your intent here that browsers

1910
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,620
always query this well-known on all

1911
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,420
websites

1912
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,360
so then the intention I'm sorry

1913
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,060
no no please go ahead the intention is

1914
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,620
that browsers do not know about this at

1915
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,320
all the client here is a Zone Factory

1916
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:36,080
which is a term that Stephen sort of uh

1917
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,480
appropriated for a component of an

1918
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,159
authoritative DNS server that is

1919
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:44,059
populating the zone

1920
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,820
oh I get it all right thank you yes

1921
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,080
Okay so

1922
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,179
so the feedback I'm getting is uh not

1923
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:59,580
crazy we're flashing out a bit more

1924
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:02,400
and we'll do that

1925
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,679
great thank you okay thanks thanks Ben

1926
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:10,760
Martin you're up next

1927
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:15,080
for our final presentation

1928
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,840
always great slides

1929
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,520
I was looking for more birthday party

1930
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,840
things uh this should be short

1931
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,120
I hope everyone knows what this is I'm

1932
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,860
not going to really explain it very much

1933
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:34,380
because the next slide

1934
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:35,719
uh

1935
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:37,679
has basically all that's really

1936
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,080
necessary on this point I know a lot of

1937
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,140
people use an environment variable of

1938
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,840
this name to to do debugging of their

1939
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,940
TLS stacks

1940
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:48,780
um

1941
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,179
I think it's pretty widely implemented

1942
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:53,100
not particularly widely deployed which

1943
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,080
is a good thing

1944
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,520
and

1945
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,620
um I think it feels like Wireshark and

1946
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:01,860
whatnot use this uh natively we also

1947
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:05,340
have a draft in some Ops area working

1948
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,020
group that um

1949
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,820
I think it's the Ops area working group

1950
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:11,880
that they're trying to define the pcap

1951
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,520
format in RFC form

1952
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,440
that's going to rely on this next place

1953
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:25,020
uh okay why so currently the

1954
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,060
authoritative documentation for this

1955
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,300
file format is sitting in the NSS Source

1956
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,140
tree

1957
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,820
that's not great

1958
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,980
it gets published on a web page

1959
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:37,679
it used to be published

1960
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,380
on n mdn

1961
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,880
and then they decided they didn't want

1962
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,739
all of this documentation and so it's

1963
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,500
now in the Firefox Source docs uh thing

1964
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,719
that's pretty hard to find

1965
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,520
and I think it's probably more

1966
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,580
appropriate that has a stable home

1967
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,620
the next slide

1968
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:58,199
so we take that documentation and we put

1969
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:01,140
it in an RFC that's it

1970
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,699
um and the idea is to give change

1971
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:05,400
controls to the ITF

1972
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,800
next

1973
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,060
done

1974
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,239
foreign

1975
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,880
look at that very easy

1976
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,820
um I guess the question is uh is this

1977
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,500
work that this working group wants to

1978
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,820
take on

1979
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,199
should I ask

1980
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:24,300
an operations area working group instead

1981
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:27,380
I'd rather not

1982
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:29,520
so I can take a poll

1983
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,320
um if there's support for adopting this

1984
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,520
and then we can take it to the mailing

1985
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,239
list my excuse me my uh understanding is

1986
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:37,980
that this would be informational not

1987
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,239
necessarily standard track because it's

1988
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:41,520
not interoperability formats so to speak

1989
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,400
or are we in the minutia it is an

1990
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,380
interoperability thing I mean one stack

1991
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,000
produces something and some other tool

1992
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,940
consumes it uh there's an argument to be

1993
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,219
had here for for making it standards

1994
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:55,620
track all right I'm not falling on this

1995
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,719
sword for sure so let's just take a

1996
01:16:57,719 --> 01:16:58,920
general pull off to see if there's

1997
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,300
interest and I will write that up now

1998
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,080
foreign

1999
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,920
azzi yes

2000
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,520
Melanie yeah yeah sorry Eddie I can't

2001
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,500
get my meat Echo to work so I couldn't

2002
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,600
get in the queues but but yeah no I

2003
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,940
think I support this work a great deal I

2004
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:23,520
think it's very very useful uh just just

2005
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,520
out of curiosity is there any I don't

2006
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,500
know if it's in scope or out of scope

2007
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,699
but

2008
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:31,860
um is there any thought of saying like

2009
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:35,580
that browsers or other things should

2010
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:38,640
Implement something like this just a

2011
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,480
question

2012
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:42,780
now there's there's a great deal of

2013
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:44,580
debate about this

2014
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,659
um

2015
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:48,420
even even within my own project there

2016
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:50,460
are people who would rather this not be

2017
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,980
enabled uh in release builds and and

2018
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:55,260
things like that uh

2019
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:58,140
it carries significant risks to both

2020
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,699
security and privacy to enable this

2021
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:02,760
thing and so uh rightfully people are

2022
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,980
concerned about uh implementing this

2023
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,380
this is not uniformly implemented as I

2024
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,400
understand

2025
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,960
uh there are a number of stacks that

2026
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:13,560
simply don't do this and that's okay

2027
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,739
some people don't need it

2028
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:19,620
so so Stephen question and a possible

2029
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,960
comment uh an inevitable comment uh but

2030
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,780
uh the question is to what extent does

2031
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,880
the current documentation uh contain

2032
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,659
warnings and guardrails uh it just tells

2033
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:32,340
you how to do it right so the current

2034
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:35,100
documentation is here's the format

2035
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,920
that's it right so the RSA has a large

2036
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,020
section on the privacy and security

2037
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,940
implications of recording one of these

2038
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:43,440
things and the information that's that's

2039
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,780
in there that's one of the changes that

2040
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:48,840
I've I've made okay sorry was there is

2041
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,640
there a drive published

2042
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,020
there's a draft published oh sorry I

2043
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,880
missed that slide I guess right there

2044
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,800
um okay so yeah I mean I I would

2045
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,420
actually strangely be supportive of

2046
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,640
documenting how to do it if we put

2047
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,280
enough text saying when not to do it in

2048
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:05,580
there and I that might take a quite a

2049
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:08,219
bit of wrangling I suppose take a look

2050
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:10,020
at what I put in there I I spent maybe

2051
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,659
an entire hour on this document so it's

2052
01:19:12,659 --> 01:19:15,600
probably not complete but there is a

2053
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,560
fairly substantial section on you know

2054
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,940
what do you do when you've got one of

2055
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,260
these things what are the risks to the

2056
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:25,380
to the active connections and and the um

2057
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:26,580
connections that happened in the past

2058
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:27,780
that might be logged in this way and

2059
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:30,179
various other things right and and I I

2060
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:31,320
would tend to think this might be better

2061
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,060
as informational because I think that

2062
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,620
might make the

2063
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:38,840
fun fight a bit more attractable but

2064
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,540
I have a stupid question how's this

2065
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:45,420
different from pkcsa

2066
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,940
sorry the audio here is just horrific I

2067
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:52,199
can't pkcs8 that she said yeah how is it

2068
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:54,239
different than pkcs number eight eight

2069
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:55,980
oh eight

2070
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,320
the storage one you know

2071
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,100
uh that's the storage one yeah we don't

2072
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,900
do anything fancy in terms of protecting

2073
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:07,440
uh the secrets here it's just yes plain

2074
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,140
text key hanging out here's some hex

2075
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,360
just in the thing so if you're in

2076
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,920
operating in fips mode and a lot of

2077
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,199
things you just can't do this

2078
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:19,380
for instance so then I don't care right

2079
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,480
right you probably don't care

2080
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,100
you you're one of those people who

2081
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,719
probably like I can't do this then I

2082
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,940
can't do this that's fine badge sorry

2083
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,520
um yes I don't care right because I'm

2084
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,980
going to make you do fips damn it of

2085
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,900
course yeah yeah

2086
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,960
so this is also

2087
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,360
yeah this is also more of like a stream

2088
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,460
of keys sort of format in the sense you

2089
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:44,280
can like pipe this out of a stack into a

2090
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,020
wire shark or whatever so it's it's

2091
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,840
pretty different from a container format

2092
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,520
all right so I have a pool ready to go

2093
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,140
which is just to get a sense of the room

2094
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,000
is there interest in working on draft

2095
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,739
Thompson Dash TLS keylog file IB in the

2096
01:20:58,739 --> 01:21:01,580
TLs working group

2097
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,260
I will start that session now and give

2098
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,219
people some time to

2099
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,040
raise means yes you would like it to

2100
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,640
no means do not rise is not the absence

2101
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:17,760
of an answer it is the opposition yes

2102
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,800
to this

2103
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,699
stupid tool

2104
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,420
all right we'll give it about another 30

2105
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,400
seconds

2106
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,260
so I'd be curious to hear

2107
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:35,159
why we would concretely not do this

2108
01:21:35,159 --> 01:21:36,540
all right so it seems like we're

2109
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:40,580
stabling out at somewhere in the 30s

2110
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:45,360
and ding it

2111
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,719
all right so 33 participants 28 raised

2112
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,719
hands and five do not raise hands I'll

2113
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:53,640
end this session now and is there

2114
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,000
anybody who said uh who who kind of

2115
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,920
doesn't want to do this they're willing

2116
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,360
to get to the microphone to say why

2117
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:04,800
okay

2118
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,960
all right thank you very much

2119
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,760
so I guess the only thing since we're

2120
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,920
actually done early for like once in

2121
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,280
like the last 10 years in like in like

2122
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,739
in the last

2123
01:22:15,739 --> 01:22:19,140
in the last and so there's there's

2124
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,600
definitely some uh chatter in the room

2125
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,580
about just close the session but we have

2126
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:26,040
a few drafts that have been out that

2127
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,719
were adopted and then expired so I guess

2128
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:29,159
the question is what should we do with

2129
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:30,739
those the two that come to mind

2130
01:22:30,739 --> 01:22:33,480
specifically are the batch uh signatures

2131
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:36,659
and the other one is the semi-static uh

2132
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:39,659
draft so I'm curious if if David

2133
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:41,400
Benjamin wants to get to the microphone

2134
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,260
and say anything about batch signing or

2135
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,780
if you'd like it to quietly go away

2136
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:47,699
um and not getting the microphone is a

2137
01:22:47,699 --> 01:22:49,500
perfectly fine answer

2138
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,840
um so that we know not to keep harping

2139
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,100
on this and we can just kind of let it

2140
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,640
quietly just drift off into space

2141
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,260
David Benjamin

2142
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,540
um at one point batch signing Enthusiast

2143
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:03,360
but uh at this point I had like the the

2144
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,120
thing that I was interested in it for no

2145
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:09,239
longer happened it's it seems no one has

2146
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:11,640
picked it up like I think if someone

2147
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,860
wants it it's a cool mechanism but I

2148
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,300
don't have time to drive it fair enough

2149
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,460
no one else does either so so what we'll

2150
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,460
do is we'll it will it's it's expired we

2151
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,080
will let the process do its thing and

2152
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,820
it's expired and if anybody else wants

2153
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:25,380
to take it over and run with it we will

2154
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:28,380
uh they can contact us and we will see

2155
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:30,060
how we can go from there on the

2156
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:31,920
semi-static

2157
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,540
Becker orange is ahead of me in the

2158
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,179
queue oh sorry

2159
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:37,440
oh okay

2160
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,080
um so yes uh I still do care somebody

2161
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,420
static I think others do too it just I

2162
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,679
can only do about one thing at once

2163
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,980
right now so um so ask me again when

2164

8446 business done okay great thanks

2165
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,340
Martin

2166
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,460
so I understand that there's some wife a

2167
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,140
chairs to sort of Mark a document as

2168
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:59,760
like abandoned or something like that

2169
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,880
right I suggest we do that drafts can be

2170
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,980
unabandoned at any time

2171
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:08,340
uh so for for the batch signing thing

2172
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,920
just say look we're not working on this

2173
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,360
right now well I mean it's like

2174
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,739
technically I believe it's actually

2175
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:16,080
expired and so it's it's actually fallen

2176
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,640
out of the working group

2177
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,440
um does that work does that happen for

2178
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,719
expired draft I think think expired

2179
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:23,640
drafts sort of have this still still

2180
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,560
have this sort of residual State thing

2181
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,239
that's in there

2182
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:28,800
yeah and they show up in the in the

2183
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,179
tracker and whatnot but if you mark them

2184
01:24:30,179 --> 01:24:32,640
as a Banda they're sort of yeah all

2185
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,679
right I'll figure out how to press the

2186
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:37,679
buttons and yeah and we might not do

2187
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:40,020
that for the semi-static one yeah I mean

2188
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,360
