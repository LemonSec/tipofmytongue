1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,440
foreign

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,619
okay uh we have a full agenda we are

3
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,320
going to start on time

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,900
um I'm Mike Jones my

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,980
co-chair is Evo

6
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,559
and we will be having a lot of good

7
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,300
because I had discussions today

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,940
so note well the note well as I've heard

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,160
life and others say

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,379
it's a condition of participation

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,359
meeting tips

12
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,119
do sign in to the meet Echo light

13
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,000
uh without audio

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,299
you will use it to queue when you went

15
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,840
want to speak

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,180
um that is true both of in-person

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,960
participants and remote participants so

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,439
that we can be fair about uh

19
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,059
letting people participate

20
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,759
wear masks unless you're speaking at a

21
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,799
microphone

22
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,180
and if you're remote make sure you're uh

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,520
microphone is off unless you're actively

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,259
presenting

25
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,979
thank you

26
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,880
this is a standard set of resources

27
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,640
which has been in all the chair slides

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,799
including the agenda from which you can

29
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,159
join

30
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,360
we do have one volunteer for note taking

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,100
I would like

32
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,680
to get a second person who's willing to

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,000
tag team and help

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Jesus

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,239
okay I'm gonna start volunteering people

36
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,980
if I don't get a volunteer

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,700
tell you what honest when you're not

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,000
presenting can you tag team on the note

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,739
taking

40
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,420
thank you very much

41
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,400
and maybe Russ could you do it when

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,959
hanas is presenting thank you

43
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,019
we have quite a full agenda I'm going to

44
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,959
be ruthless with the clock should I need

45
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,540
to I would ask the presenters to try to

46
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,420
stay within their time slots we have a

47
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,860
lot of interesting material and

48
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,000
discussions to be had

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,000
the good news

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
is that

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,879
we finished a bunch of rfcs and there's

52
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,879
two more about to be finished

53
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,540
um

54
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,959
thanks to Paul for encouraging us and

55
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,420
for those who did the work

56
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,480
for getting us there it's been a journey

57
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
but we now have an internet standard for

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,599
because they

59
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,780
and with that

60
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,299
I am going to switch to Russ

61
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,739
foreign

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,260
thank you next slide please

63
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,500
so the the topic is uh whether we should

64
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,159
support a couple of

65
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,700
non-authenticated encryption algorithms

66
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,019
we proposed this at the last ietf put

67
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,840
together a draft

68
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,760
the suit working group for their

69
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,899
firmware encryption draft is using it

70
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,220
and um

71
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,040
just last month

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,100
the this working group adopted the draft

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,180
to assign to code points next slide

74
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,040
basically code points for counter mode

75
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,340
with three key sizes and CBC mode with

76
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,520
three key sizes all marked as deprecated

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,040
in the

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,740
Ayana registry just to make sure that

79
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,440
people don't accidentally use this them

80
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,300
when they think they are getting an

81
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,000
authenticated mode the document tells

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,280
them it has to be used with some

83
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,000
mechanism such as a digital signature in

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,040
order to provide that integrity

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,560
next slide please

86
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,759
um

87
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,000
last week or the week before we got a

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,660
bunch of comments about the things that

89
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,400
can go wrong when you don't have

90
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,080
Authentication

91
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,259
we knew these of course but we did

92
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,259
address these specific things Ian

93
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,699
proposed security consideration text

94
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,400
um next slide

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,340
so there's basically three possible ways

96
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,699
forward one is we adopt that security

97
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,340
considerations text and assign those

98
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,560
code points

99
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,340
um it was observed in the um concerns

100
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,259
that the padding attack does uh have

101
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,320
some concerns above and beyond counter

102
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,280
mode uh the padding associated with CBC

103
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,280
so one thing we could do since the boot

104
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,340
loader implementation seemed to prefers

105
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,580
counter mode anyway as we could drop CBC

106
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,280
and proceed with just one of the modes

107
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,100
or the third thing is we can tell the

108
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,380
suit working group know if it's not

109
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,960
authenticated encryption we're not going

110
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,479
to register it

111
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,940
and then that what that means is at

112
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,580
least those boot loaders who are

113
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,160
insisting on using counter mode will not

114
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,960
implement the standard

115
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,220
so those are our three choices and uh

116
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,919
the consequences thereof

117
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,720
um and I'd like to know what the working

118
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,360
group wants to do

119
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,319
that's the question

120
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,900
um I I'm not making any comments I'm

121
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,580
just relaying a couple things from the

122
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,080
list in case people haven't seen it

123
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,900
please introduce yourself I was in the

124
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,160
queue so I thought I had introduced

125
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,380
myself virtually

126
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,479
um it helps the note taker fair enough

127
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,240
yes uh the first was there's been some

128
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,259
commentary that maybe we can say

129
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,880
something that's more severe than

130
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,400
deprecated like special considerations

131
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,340
or something like that I'm not sure but

132
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,740
maybe that's an option

133
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,560
um the other comment was that there are

134
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,680
some aeads that maybe do work out of

135
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,479
order if you squint at them just enough

136
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,520
I don't know I'm not a cryptographer

137
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,220
like prayer Rock

138
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,340
thank you Michael uh Pro Rock here um I

139
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,699
believe for sure option one should be

140
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,160
done let's add even though there's a

141
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,300
concern you know the security

142
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,360
considerations is getting along here

143
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,919
it's longer than the rest of them oh no

144
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,560
it's uh there are some similar things in

145
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,880
some of the other things that I'm

146
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,860
working on right with very long hashes

147
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,120
so

148
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,919
um but I do think there's a high degree

149
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,680
of value in registering even if it's

150
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,620
marked deprecated or do not use or some

151
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,199
other stronger language if for no other

152
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,840
reason is that then that will encourage

153
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,120
someone who thinks oh I found this neat

154
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,819
thing let me go look up what's going on

155
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,280
with this and then they see mountains of

156
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,199
security considerations and realize why

157
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,300
this might be a bad thing unless they

158
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,560
really really know what they're doing

159
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,379
and have a very specific use case so

160
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,819
that is not to say that there aren't

161
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,680
highly specific use cases for this

162
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,199
personal feelings are and having talked

163
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,760
a bit with some of the Sioux folks and

164
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,799
things like that is that there might be

165
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,260
a better way out at the very least if we

166
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,059
register this this might provide a

167
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,860
stopgap mechanism just to continue

168
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,740
proofing things out as long as we're

169
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,660
very clear we're not trying to advocate

170
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,399
for the use of this broadly right

171
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,779

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,880
yeah hey just kind of riffing on

173
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,500
Brendan's suggestion about something

174
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,160
stronger than uh than deprecated I

175
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,540
wonder if

176
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,920
it would be possible to do something

177
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,260
like Mark these as reserved these code

178
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,240
points as allocates and code points in

179
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,800
the diameter industry but mark them as

180
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,920
reserved and then in some suit documents

181
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,940
uh Define their usage any a special suit

182
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,440
way

183
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,680
foreign

184
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,959
it means like no one's going to come

185
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,300
across the registry be scanning for

186
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,220
things and say oh there's a CBC thing

187
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,019
here I can use this

188
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,580
um and then you'll never even get to the

189
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,500
security

190
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,940
I'm good entertained by Michael's

191
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,200
assistant people are going to pull up

192
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,459
the document and see if the security is

193
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:39,959
considering

194
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,480
um

195
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,880
would prevent that sort of risk

196
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
so Richard I would not want it to be

197
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,540
hard to find out what algorithm that

198
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,240
code Point meant

199
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,220
which seems to be what you're proposing

200
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,700
um you could do something I think

201
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,220
maybe like list

202
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,120
the suit document that defines the

203
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,880
acknowledge should be mostly safe usage

204
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,860
as a reference in the registry for why

205
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,360
it's reserved

206
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,980
ah sure we could we could uh say only

207
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,279
for use with x

208
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,740
precisely so you basically Define a

209
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,300
special use code that was only

210
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,459
meaningful in scope of that specific

211
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,680
usage which you know if someone comes up

212
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,140
with a second usage for CTR or CBC like

213
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,100
could get awkward but hopefully you know

214
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,420
one might hope that those won't come up

215
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,899
too often

216
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,399
okay good

217
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm not sure I understood Richard's

218
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,779
proposal there but they're all

219
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,180
legitimate uses of I mean there are

220
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,820
multiple legitimate uses of

221
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,660
of country mode for example so we have

222
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,420
in the sigma protocol the second message

223
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,240
only needs

224
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,140
indistinguishability against chosen

225
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,959
plain text attack so as CTR would be a

226
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,120
good fit there

227
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,360
so I I I support

228
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,880
options one or two here and I don't

229
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,079
think there should be

230
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,000
sort of restriction on how you use them

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,680
because unless it's a very easy way to

232
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,300
update that and that might be a very

233
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,500
long list of things where you want to

234
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,519
make this

235
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,019
special cases

236
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,720
okay chair how do we decide

237
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,500
um

238
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,620
so far I hear people speaking for option

239
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,279
one and two

240
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,140
um I heard one and two but not three

241
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,560
which is I'm encouraged by not three

242
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
and

243
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,820
not wearing my chair hat I would

244
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,640
encourage us to follow normal

245
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,279
registration processes

246
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,100
unless there's a strong reason not to I

247
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,740
did hear you're come to the mic say

248
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,740
there may be multiple uses for these

249
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,800
which I think argues against making them

250
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,399
special purpose uh with that thank you

251
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,920
for your time we can continue this on

252
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,439
the list honest it's your turn thank you

253
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,560
thank you Mike

254
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,779
okay HP key um

255
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,700
next slide

256
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,100
it looked like a very easy document uh

257
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,519
at the beginning

258
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,740
and we had a discussion at the last ITF

259
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,480
meeting which also was uncontroversial

260
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,660
about the encoding of the encrypt or the

261
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,959
output of the HB key uh uh then

262
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,339
following the confirmation call on the

263
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,220
mailing list it turned out that that was

264
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,779
um not quite true

265
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:58,500
um

266
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,139
and

267
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,540
with the Alternatives were proposed but

268
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,779
those couldn't uh reach or we couldn't

269
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,579
reach a conclusion either which is why

270
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,579
the the chairs specifically Mike posted

271
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:12,899
a mail to the list

272
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,240
um mentioning that outcome of that call

273
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,680
so

274
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,820
um I put a few slides in here and for

275
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,200
you to look at what the current

276
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,240
proposals are in addition to what's in

277
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,620
the working group document which I

278
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,839
hadn't updated because

279
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,519
obviously we need to First have a

280
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,980
conclusion on what we updated with

281
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,700
next slide

282
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,060
so

283
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,200
um Daisuke proposed made a very specific

284
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,680
proposal and I color coded the important

285
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,420
information here

286
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,920
so there is um so this is the

287
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,040
uh this is sort of like encrypt zero

288
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,120
payload

289
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,839
um

290
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,880
where the use of HP Keyes oops

291
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,660
one pack

292
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,120
what okay uh is indicated using this HP

293
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,220
key algorithm which we would have to

294
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,820
register and then the essence or the

295
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,260
core of the information that is being

296
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,440
passed around in is in this newly

297
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,200
introduced uh hbke sender information

298
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,079
structure which contains

299
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,300
um which is a map containing of a few

300
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,740
Fields

301
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,800
um namely the chem the kdf and the aad

302
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,779
which is uh which is populated with

303
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,680
values from the hpke established

304
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,040
Registries uh the ink

305
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,740
um field is the output of the hpkey

306
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,480
algorithm

307
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,720
um and it's obviously abbreviated here

308
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,480
so that's his proposal uh

309
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,000
the next slide

310
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,060
um Hillary's proposal

311
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,500
uh layers on top of this and instead of

312
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,220
um

313
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,040
he makes a few changes uh maybe actually

314
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,660
we go to the next slide this is sort of

315
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,519
the textual description of what you see

316
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,920
here is

317
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,320
um is to use an array instead of a map

318
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,560
thereby and making it non-extensible uh

319
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,459
and omitting the chem and he believes

320
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,740
that one can come up with uh processing

321
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,839
rules for sort of guessing what the

322
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,760
chemdan is uh

323
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,120
uh otherwise it's it's conceptual is

324
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,940
similar I I would say except for those

325
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,680
those changes

326
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,180
um although he did raise a few new

327
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,480
points on the mailing list um a new new

328
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,579
issues that we may or may not uh

329
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,380
introduce

330
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,560
um which I I

331
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,019
were kind of completely new

332
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,480
um weren't raised previously so I I

333
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,100
omitted them here

334
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,199
but in in essence those are the two

335
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,060
proposals and

336
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,279
that what the actually three proposals

337
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,860
there's the original one uh neither

338
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,440
Richard nor

339
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,279
um

340
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,560
no Hillary no I'm uh

341
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,980
uh or none of the the booklet proponents

342
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,560
uh like that idea but this is kind of

343
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,839
what we are these two proposals are but

344
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,920
we share it in and if you have any

345
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,120
preference on what you would like to do

346
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,480
uh that would be highly welcome

347
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,279
that's what I'm essentially saying with

348
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,540
the last slide

349
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,220
so

350
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,800
I we don't

351
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,139
it's like besides uh

352
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,760
small number of people who have strong

353
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,560
opinions we haven't

354
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,759
come up with something yet yeah you know

355
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,740
so I apologize I haven't really looked

356
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,180
at all the details here but you're

357
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,399
proposing the in it's a cozy key that's

358
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,079
what remains in the draft in these are

359
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,920
the two

360
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,800
counter proposals against that and

361
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,660
basically they are indexed by the

362
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,180
algorithm algorithm

363
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,759
which then creates this new this new

364
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,339
entire format so you basically read off

365
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,040
from the camera the the minus one but

366
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,319
this is a cam uh and then you oh sorry

367
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,540
this is an hpk and then your

368
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,939
all the rest of the fields are defined

369
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,220
is that understanding the proposals yeah

370
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,099
like um that that's correct in some

371
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,939
sense

372
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,400
um we are really talking about how to

373
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,679
encode the different fields that uh are

374
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,000
communicated and they're not that many

375
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,419
fields right uh there's uh the chem the

376
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,520
aadid

377
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,860
um the kdf and and of course the

378
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,660
encryption field and that needs to go

379
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,580
somewhere uh and the question is where

380
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,980
should that go

381
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,679
it

382
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,360
like on a very high level it doesn't

383
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,379
sound like rocket science

384
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,140
learned yeah uh Lawrence dunblade

385
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,799
um

386
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,080
so so in this Pro in all the proposals

387
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,900
the the algorithm top level algorithm is

388
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,960
just hpk hpke

389
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,299
and this seems like a Divergence from

390
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,100
what everything else is in cozy where

391
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,960
you kind of have us the the top level

392
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,080
algorithm is more of a cipher Suite

393
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,940
um that specifies all the things now I

394
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,440
know the fan out here can be quite large

395
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,179
but one of the advantages I thought of

396
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,980
with of the cipher suite at the top

397
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,840
level are two advantages I see at The

398
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,760
Cypher speed at the top level is you

399
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,740
just have to look at the algorithm ID to

400
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,940
know whether you can support it or not

401
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,740
you don't have to decode a lot more deep

402
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,559
a lot deeper into it and it allows us to

403
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,620
register only sensible Cipher Suites and

404
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,440
avoid uh some of the fan out so my gut

405
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,500
reaction is that's I I would prefer that

406
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,780
and not to diverge what code from Jose

407
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,419
has done in the past and I think there's

408
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,000
some good reasons for that yeah yeah

409
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,580
that's um that mirrors um

410
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,320
what is currently described in a working

411
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,360
group document but that approach didn't

412
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,059
uh find a lot of sympathy

413
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,740
um because the

414
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
the

415
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,799
Vision was that uh the hpkey guys would

416
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,900
register new algorithms and then they

417
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,620
would become instantly available in in

418
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,280
cozy HP key uh by reusing existing

419
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,620
registry that's why um

420
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,620
the the way how these field three fields

421
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,059
are structured it's kind of populated

422
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,440
with the values from the existing

423
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,299
registry whether that's a gigantic

424
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,480
benefit or not uh that's in the eye of

425
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,179
the beholder but uh yeah that's at least

426
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,380
um that's the rationale

427
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,580
Mike yeah Michael prayer Rock

428
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,760
yeah I'm gonna Echo similar support for

429
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,860
the way the document's written now um

430
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,799
I'm not saying a huge benefit to

431
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:42,539
diverging massively from the existing

432
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,220
methods that are being taken with kose

433
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,740
registry um it seems to make sense right

434
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,840
same reason like point at the owl go

435
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,120
after this right uh follow a common

436
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,860
sense approach there

437
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,020
I have a little bit of concern pointing

438
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,820
out to a secondary registry and then

439
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,039
just we magically get something right

440
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,080
maybe that's good maybe that's bad

441
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,880
I'm a little more concerned about that

442
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,520
approach especially because HP hpk is

443
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,799
such a you know special case right it's

444
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,360
not really

445
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,580
going down the same path as what we

446
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,380
normally deal with with saying oh I've

447
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,120
got this very well-defined family of

448
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,340
algorithms this

449
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,140
specific algorithm and parameter set

450
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,360
it's more facilitating use of that in

451
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,479
other

452
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,900
Richard and then we'll move on

453
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,720
so just one quick clarification on what

454
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,980
Mike said

455
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,660
um I I'm ambivalent on the question of

456
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,280
how we indicate algorithms for what it's

457
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,760
worth MLS and other hpke user did choose

458
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,280
to define specific code points that are

459
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,940
combinations of hbke sub algorithms so

460
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,440
um it wouldn't be totally interesting to

461
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,200
do that here but you would have the the

462
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,419
lack of agility as you must pointed out

463
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,600
I I do think that it is not an option to

464
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
go with the document exactly as it is

465
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,900
right now because we need to update to

466
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,340
fix this code State key problem

467
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,140
represent the encapsulated value as

468
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,880
specific plates so there's some changes

469
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,419
necessary here

470
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,900
foreign thank you any closing remarks on

471
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,400
us

472
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,960
I think Sean just keep this keep

473
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,880
discussing it and hopefully finding a

474
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,559
solution at the end of the day

475
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,380
all right next we'll have the uh

476
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,419
seabor encoded cert yes

477
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,299
excellent oh hi all

478
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:41,220
uh yes it's you will heard Leon speaking

479
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,100
and we wanted to give you a update on

480
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,020
the status and ongoing work on the

481
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,440
seabor encoded x509 certificates and

482
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,960
also to remind everybody to come with

483
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,559
input on those issues where yeah input

484
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,880
is valuable

485
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,840
next slide please

486
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,039
oh that's what I've already covered one

487
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,080
more please

488
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,539
and as a quick reminder of the overall

489
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,380
trade-offs so this is all about finding

490
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,159
the good trade-off between compactness

491
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,320
and convenience to parse and process for

492
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,320
iot devices while still being General

493
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,380
enough to encode as many relevant x509

494
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,080
certificates as possible so these are

495
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,059
the the different goals that we try to

496
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,080
balance

497
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,740
in this proposal and now I'm going to

498
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,780
quickly relatively quickly step through

499
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,000
a number of open issues and then

500
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,480
depending on time and interest

501
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,760
maybe actually gather some input but

502
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,280
most of it will be for your information

503
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,220
and then if there is interest there is

504
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,200
definitely we're definitely interested

505
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,600
in hearing input on basically all of

506
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,520
this even though we have our own

507
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,500
proposals for solving most of them

508
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:04,500
um so a recurring topic is whether the

509
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,559
the minor optimizations that was

510
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,720
proposed in the beginning should be kept

511
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,360
because they make the the processing a

512
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,360
bit more complex but they are needed to

513
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,320
actually reach the very most compact

514
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,380
uh cases for iot profiling so we are

515
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,360
basically inclined to keep them unless

516
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,880
there is a big outcry for making it

517
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,880
simpler and more streamlined next please

518
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,340
and so this is about the encoding of

519
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,059
signature algorithms and as some of you

520
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,240
might know there is still sha-1 being

521
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,000
used out in the wild meaning to actually

522
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,179
be a general purpose uh format we need

523
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,120
to handle these types of of

524
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,840
uh signatory encodings and there has

525
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,520
been some discussion of whether they

526
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,860
should be punished in terms of being a

527
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,100
longer having longer encodings but we

528
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,620
think that as long as they are used for

529
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,780
many CA certificates it doesn't really

530
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,480
make sense to actively punish them that

531
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,100
rather we should keep it in the same

532
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,460
range as other signature algorithms

533
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,159
so we propose to use normal to bite

534
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,840
assignments to cover these signature

535
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,580
algorithms next please

536
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,960
so this is also more on the info stage

537
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,780
that there has been already observed

538
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,820
it's been observed that what we're

539
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,360
proposing here should also benefit in

540
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,159
terms of revocation lists and OCS ocsp

541
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,400
messaging and the rice and Ericsson

542
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,559
together have been having a multitis

543
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,080
which has been looking into this so this

544
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,600
is something we hope to be feeding back

545
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,240
into the existing proposals

546
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,080
next please

547
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,620
and this is also just uh to to make sure

548
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,960
that it is self-contained the the draft

549
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,340
in in terms of actual usability for iot

550
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,200
because right now we we list a big

551
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,020
number of algorithms and not all of them

552
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,659
are of course suitable for iot so this

553
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,760
is just a sanity check to make sure that

554
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,100
we keep the knowledge on what are

555
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,380
actually good algorithms for iot cases

556
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,720
that we try to promote next please

557
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,880
so this is this is a bullet where input

558
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,000
from a larger audience would be valuable

559
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,059
even though from our perspective there

560
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,400
has been discussions on whether we

561
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,940
should make propose more complex

562
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,340
structure where broccoli uh well back up

563
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,039
one step so basically that that there

564
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,179
could be

565
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,779
certificate chain optimizations done if

566
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,419
we would allow to pass parsing of

567
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,360
certificate chains

568
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,460
uh but from our perspective we see that

569
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,159
this would add to Max much complexity to

570
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
the the parching ending and make it less

571
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,360
suitable for the iot device the

572
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,179
scenarios that we at least I care deeply

573
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,340
about and that rather it could be

574
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,620
handled through additional cozy headers

575
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,980
and external broadly compression

576
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,500
but this is somewhere if if the audience

577
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,840
has strong opinions we are very

578
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,419
interested in hearing them but now we

579
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,640
step on and take eventual discussions at

580
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,020
the end

581
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,860
next please

582
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,220
so this is a short break to to upload

583
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,140
many insightful observations from

584
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,260
Hillary and we are addressing them and I

585
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,240
will speak about some of them next

586
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
please

587
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,520
so this is the basically work in

588
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,419
progress to handle kind of more Corner

589
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,640
cases that we had missed in the initial

590
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,919
proposal so these are all

591
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,020
kind of fixes to make it more general

592
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,380
for the next version of the draft

593
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,220
next please

594
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:07,980
and this is an again an important

595
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,440
highlighting

596
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,700
that currently

597
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,000
the IP range encoding could

598
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,020
theoretically break the seaboor int

599
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,360
encoding if you would have since we

600
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,640
encode differences so if you would have

601
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,740
a crazy subnet where you would care to

602
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,159
cover too much of the IP Subspace you

603
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:30,960
could in theory break it

604
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,919
and instead of of trying to address this

605
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,440
as we see very much Corner case we we

606
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,360
should make it clear that this is a

607
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,900
limitation of the existing proposal

608
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,620
next please

609
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,440
oh this is uh yet the the last issue

610
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,559
where also input from audience could be

611
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,260
really useful

612
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,940
that Hillary made the real life

613
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,100
observation about the authority key

614
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,480
identifier

615
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,659
that the in in real life actual

616
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,080
certificates lack

617
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,620
one of the the sub parameters

618
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,900
and this can be fixed by allowing null

619
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,360
encoding to to cover these cases but

620
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,700
that leaves two of the other

621
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,260
subparameters which we in our

622
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,900
investigations have not found to need

623
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,320
null encoding as well but we haven't

624
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,140
done extensive studies so if this is uh

625
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,779
if this is a real life problem we should

626
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,059
allow also these submar meters to be

627
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,900
encoded as null and this we are open for

628
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,820
adjusting if if we think that it's a

629
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,159
problem that needs addressing otherwise

630
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,799
it's all about clarifying the the

631
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,500
assumptions that we have made

632
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,080
and that was the last issue that I

633
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,179
wanted to present to you and I'm of

634
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:55,679
course we're very

635
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,740
happy for comments now or on the mailing

636
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,480
list as we are progressing with this

637
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,559
work thank you

638
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,940
any questions if so please join the

639
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,240
queue

640
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,320
all right

641
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,279
um

642
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,919
thank you Joel uh at this point we'll

643
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,440
turn it to Tobias for

644
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,559
the BLS key representation draft

645
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,740
uh next slide

646
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,059
so this is just a quick update and we're

647
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,279
Fisher on this draft so it defines and

648
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,620
registers the required parameters

649
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,960
um Diana for the graphic key

650
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,020
representation for the Beretta Lynn

651
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,299
Scott elliptic curve family so BLS

652
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:12,899
curves for representation in both koseki

653
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,539
and jwk

654
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,679
uh next slide

655
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,500
uh so so why do it um well Beretta

656
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,320
Lynn's got um elliptic curves have a a

657
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,820
couple of special properties to them

658
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,140
known as

659
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,020
um they are known as peering friendly

660
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,360
um which allows different signature

661
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,980
style Primitives

662
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,460
um two of such Uh current drafts of the

663
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,059
cfrg BLS signatures is one notable that

664
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,220
has been addressed for some time there

665
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,380
is also a appearing friendly curves

666
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,720
draft that was recently updated which

667
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,659
formally defines the curves and then

668
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,000
lastly there is also another signature

669
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,860
scheme draft

670
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,559
um that I'm also a co-author of that was

671
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,620
newly adopted at the cfrg since the last

672
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,159
iatf meeting and both of these make use

673
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,640
of the VLS curve which is

674
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,000
um as as as per industry adoption the

675
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,100
most popular of the peering curve family

676
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,000
right now

677
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,980
next slide

678
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,640
and so just a very basic status update

679
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,720
um

680
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,539
as as spoken about it's a simple draft

681
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,700
primarily registering these perimeters

682
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,159
and the draft was adopted

683
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,140
um since atf-114 we published recently

684
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,480
an update which added jwk based examples

685
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,279
and I'm close to filing a a PR and

686
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,340
making a publication for adding the koze

687
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,960
key examples

688
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,600
yeah

689
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,139
it looks like

690
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,240
that's it

691
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,200
oh that's it

692
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,179
Tobias do you have any questions to the

693
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,399
working group at this point or what

694
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,159
actions would you like them to take

695
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,240
uh no no explicitations Beyond um just

696
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,340
helping to review the draft because the

697
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,320
key examples should be

698
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,620
um and um fairly soon in the next couple

699
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,700
of days

700
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,340
um so reviewing it

701
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,059
um

702
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,299
with uh I guess with an item next steps

703
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:37,260
as per the processes as

704
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,240
um

705
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,880
yeah as as probably the next steps

706
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,299
thanks

707
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,520
okay

708
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,820
are there any questions from

709
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,480
the floor

710
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,520
all right

711
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,600
um thank you tobios

712
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,399
um now I'm going to switch roles and be

713
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,860
an individual participant

714
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,940
for presenting another draft

715
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,860
that uh

716
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,220
Tobias and I had written together

717
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,519
this is the claims in cozy headers draft

718
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,600
so what does it do it enables us to

719
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,380
represent a set of sieber web token

720
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,120
claims

721
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,799
in a special cozy header

722
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,500
they're put into a header parameter and

723
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,039
a object in a structure

724
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,539
because otherwise there would be name

725
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:54,019
collisions or number collisions between

726
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:57,059
the header parameter namespace and the

727
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,260
claims namespace

728
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,159
um so why do it there's use cases and

729
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,219
this first showed up in Jose most of a

730
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,659
decade ago

731
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,599
where it's useful to be able to have for

732
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,060
instance an unencrypted version of a

733
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,260
claim

734
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,260
that you use for processing an encrypted

735
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,379
jot or an encrypted seabler web token or

736
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,060
cosay structure

737
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,520
for instance you might want to know what

738
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,099
the issuer is before you even try to

739
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,139
decrypt it

740
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,540
um

741
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,080
Jose and jots had that we did not we

742
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,460
adopted this draft to be able to do that

743
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,639
foreign

744
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,179
draft that does one thing it was adopted

745
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,159
in July thank you

746
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,460
we just published 01 it is a one-line

747
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,300
change from zero zero that changes the

748
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,020
motivating example to issuer

749
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,960
um I will say uh you know having reread

750
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,420
it again fresh with fresh eyes in the

751
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,520
last few days I think it would be

752
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,740
beneficial to add an example

753
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,740
and I know Kirsten had asked about well

754
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,579
should we have ADD cddl as Kirsten has

755
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,500
want to do I don't see Kirsten here

756
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,619
there must be conflict but I intend to

757
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,780
ask Karsten about that offline

758
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,560
um so my question and this is where

759
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,500
Eva's gonna have to chair for a moment

760
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,140
is it time for working group last call

761
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,240
this is stable and I don't see much

762
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,700
happening to it beyond the current

763
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,980
status other than possibly adding an

764
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,339
example

765
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,000
can

766
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,420
can we can

767
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,400
add a working group let's go and live

768
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,300
there

769
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,460
either you are muted if you're trying to

770
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,500
speak to us

771
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,920
why

772
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,619
here

773
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,800
thank you

774
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,720
so um

775
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,500
I'd like

776
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,820
um I actually didn't understand the

777
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,160
example you mentioned here

778
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,220
um with the um

779
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,720
unprotected

780
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,940
yeah why sorry why not use unprotected

781
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,920
header and put uh

782
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,619
information in that so so I think I

783
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,180
think an example would be great that's

784
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,500
that's that's true and maybe maybe

785
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,060
that's good to have before we have

786
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,680
working group classical

787
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,320
I know there's been something on the

788
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,619
mailing list about

789
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:48,119
unprotected headers it's not clear to me

790
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,380
that they're the same thing because

791
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,500
they're a different name space

792
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,660
one is claims one is header parameters

793
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,440
they're distinct

794
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,940
Lawrence

795
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,720
yeah I was just going to answer that

796
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,940
question is that you know if you're

797
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,180
if you're decoding uh you know mime

798
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,040
headers or content type headers you have

799
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,900
access to that parameter and then you

800
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,760
can switch on that before you you know

801
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,579
bring up the seaboor encoder or whatever

802
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,460
um so it seems like it's a definitely uh

803
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,020
benefit implementations

804
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,320
now just to ask the questions but very

805
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,579
concretely this ISS promotion applies to

806
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,380
both the protected and the unprotected

807
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,240
header or just the protected header

808
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,200
in a

809
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,180
because I signed zero there is no

810
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,060
unprotected header

811
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,980
um if you're using

812
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,040
because they signed one structure

813
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,740
I believe that

814
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,560
there is an unprotected header it's a

815
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,119
fair question whether we want this

816
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,579
header parameter to appear

817
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,740
unprotected ever

818
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,140
and that's something we could discuss if

819
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,160
we do

820
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,160
have working group last call which is up

821
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,980
to EVO to decide

822
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,579
um

823
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,920
you could add that as a working group

824
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,940
last call comment

825
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,900
um

826
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,640
are they hear me now

827
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,400
or is it still

828
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,079
can you speak louder

829
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,700
okay

830
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,320
um so

831
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,359
maybe we can

832
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,820
see in the room if there are people that

833
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,960
are for or against the working group

834
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,099
classical I think in either case we will

835
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:02,460
confirm it on the main link list if

836
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,720
there is enough support

837
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,700
so in the room

838
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,300
maybe let's use the 14th to

839
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,420
do you know how to start that either

840
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,680
I think so

841
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,099
so those that

842
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:44,220
uh are in favor of starting the working

843
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,440
groups last call please

844
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,079
and raise your hands and see if there

845
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,760
are people that are against it please

846
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,180
also

847
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,140
um

848
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,599
will have a separate

849
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,540
vote for that

850
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,820
I would a few more seconds

851
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,780
okay so I see 11 people

852
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,320
believe we are ready for working group

853
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,480
let's go there some

854
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,119
people that think

855
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,280
Heights

856
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,920
they would have a little bit early

857
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,040
um

858
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,480
for the minutes 12 people are

859
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,760
four and two are against

860
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,900
uh if the people have

861
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,680
um

862
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,400
if people want to clarify why they think

863
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,599
it's

864
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,500
are still not ready please pick up on

865
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,700
the

866
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,680
mic now

867
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,740
um

868
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,619
we we just raised two open issues uh and

869
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:09,540
the need to add an example and to find

870
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,880
out whether these fields also applied to

871
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,339
unprotected the unprotected header it

872
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,040
sounds like uh it would be good to at

873
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,780
least update the document briefly and

874
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,220
add that example to think that could

875
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,660
happen quickly actually there was a

876
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,180
third issue as well with the cddl like

877
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,339
having three open issues appears to be

878
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:27,839
premature to call it working for bus

879
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,259
call right

880
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,960
yes okay

881
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,619
um but with those issues resolved

882
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:41,400
I guess then we'll be able to go for

883
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,520
working group let's go

884
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,300
um

885
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,320
and

886
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,880
that this

887
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,579
migrating character results

888
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:54,420
uh so yes like please

889
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,000
and take those

890
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,640
action items on those three issues and

891
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,220
and we can go to working with classical

892
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,940
hmm

893
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,400
thank you we're at time and I see that Q

894
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,700
is cleared

895
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,540
um

896
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,380
so let's move on to

897
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,200
Mike Pro Rock talking about post Quantum

898
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,399
signatures thank you all

899
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,920
thank you Mr Jones wait for that deck to

900
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,599
pop up

901
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,940
uh Mike perock here

902
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,579
um uh kind of continuing on this is the

903
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:47,940
second update since the working group uh

904
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,760
gratefully uh gracefully accepted this

905
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,880
draft to help us move it forward

906
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,980
um next slide

907
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,500
uh just a quick recap

908
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,020
um on uh post Quantum and why we're

909
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,119
dealing with this and it largely is

910
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,420
because we're seeing interesting changes

911
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,000
to the potentially threatened the way

912
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,380
we've been handling especially public

913
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,960
key cryptography and certain signature

914
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,900
methods based on use of quantum

915
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,400
entanglement and all sorts of other fun

916
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,560
things with qubits that help us unpack

917
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,079
keys and relationships within data

918
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,579
sooner

919
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:26,760
we have uh selected to go after three

920
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,680
algorithms here and we'll come back to

921
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,900
some implications from that uh from

922
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,180
signature scheme standpoint

923
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,859
um but the ones we have gone after are

924
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,900
two lattice based ones as well as a hash

925
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,000
based approach based on feedback from

926
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,220
nist and where things are at as far as

927
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,619
the candidates for standardization next

928
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:45,240
up

929
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,119
uh so once again as mentioned we've gone

930
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,099
after three that's Sphinx Falcon and I

931
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,800
lithium and the key thing here is to get

932
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,099
us a leapfrog past and be able to start

933
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,440
testing effectively for interoperability

934
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,780
with things that do require signatures

935
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,380
whether that's cwts jwts verifiable

936
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,140
credentials over in the uh

937
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,180
um World Wide Web Consortium side of the

938
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,560
world and things like that so it's

939
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,000
really setting ourselves up for

940
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,040
cryptographic agility and to be able to

941
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,660
set a path for registration to Future

942
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,520
post Quantum algorithms and Signature

943
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,220
suites as required possibly by kose and

944
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,819
or Jose usage and also to get these Iona

945
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,460
registrations in and because of the

946
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,079
parameterization especially with some of

947
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,339
these algorithms that can be quite

948
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,140
tricky let's make sure we've very

949
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,700
clearly defined that and how we would

950
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,040
use those here pointing back to cfrg and

951
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,619
this next slide

952
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:41,339
so big downsides large key sizes large

953
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:44,579
signatures uh typically larger signing

954
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:47,220
times verification times are very nice

955
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,000
next slide

956
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,500
a couple of key draft updates here we've

957
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,300
gone ahead and completed out the

958
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,780
sections on Falcon and sphinx plus we've

959
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,660
gone through and detailed out the likely

960
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,579
parameter sets that we'll see usage

961
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,560
though these are obviously subject to

962
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,839
change up until these algorithms are

963
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,480
fully standardized at nist and elsewhere

964
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,880
we are using a combination because of

965
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,740
some of the unique parameters based on

966
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,720
the way especially the Jose spec is

967
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,260
originally written around kty and ALG so

968
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,060
that we have the family of algorithms

969
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,420
specified by the kty alga is specifying

970
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,000
the actual algorithm itself as well as

971
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,140
the parameter set in use next slide

972
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,660
next steps this is really the big

973
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,180
question for the working group

974
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,220
um gut feel at this point especially

975
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,099
seeing possible lags uh pot with one

976
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:44,040
versus another uh is should we split

977
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,200
this into three drafts now that the bulk

978
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,480
of the work has been done we can pretty

979
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,700
easily do that and instead of having one

980
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,880
post Quantum uh signature scheme draft

981
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,640
that covers the three initial ones we

982
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,740
could split those up so that they can be

983
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,500
actually moved forward should that occur

984
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,619
sooner with one versus another uh or so

985
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,300
that we can let one die if we need to

986
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,180
for whatever reason the proposed names

987
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,760
at this point would be draft ietf cause

988
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,020
a dilithium falcon and sphinx plus

989
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,280
um we are awaiting obviously

990
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,500
finalizational parameter sets love any

991
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,000
feedback from that if anyone's heard

992
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,400
anything that we haven't and generalized

993
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,960
guidance from the group since this is

994
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,819
kind of the first draft I started on

995
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,859
with iatf on anything I might be uh

996
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:30,780
messing up on or could do better so

997
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,359
thanks so much and do want to make sure

998
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,640
there's a good shout out to Ori all the

999
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,020
others who have been helping us out

1000
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,140
especially Christine and uh

1001
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,880
actually some of the authors of things

1002
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,560
like Sphinx and Falcon Etc

1003
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,339
okay

1004
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:52,200
um I'm Quinta goodness uh just one

1005
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,140
comments um because three of them they

1006
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,140
they might come out at different times

1007
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,300
so I think it's a better idea to have

1008
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,760
separate documents for all of them

1009
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,119
because uh yeah they're a good chance

1010
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,240
that there will be finalized by this at

1011
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,520
different times and you don't want one

1012
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,040
to tie down the you know the unfinished

1013
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,960
Hideout the finished one

1014
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,460
thanks very much for that it's very

1015
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,960
helpful

1016
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,760
Richard

1017
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,980
yeah thanks so thanks for interesting on

1018
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,720
the Mike I think this is an obvious

1019
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,079
no-brainer to get these uh algorithm

1020
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,480
identifier specified basically as soon

1021
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,359
as the algorithms are done so I think my

1022
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,220
main concern here is not getting too far

1023
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,480
ahead of the actual algorithm

1024
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,240
standardization uh but it's like as soon

1025
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,040
as those come out of nist like let's

1026
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,940
roll

1027
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,579
um as far as the document number I think

1028
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,680
Quinn's point is probably good

1029
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,560
um if if not for that I would say just

1030
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,060
put it all in one not incur the process

1031
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,099
I've ever had three times but if there's

1032
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:55,440
if there's risk of if we can go faster

1033
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,480
with some of them by by decoupling them

1034
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,319
by all means

1035
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,900
sorry

1036
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,839
one of one of the authors I agree with

1037
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,339
splitting them up for the reasons

1038
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,380
mentioned and also for the reason that

1039
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,720
the Sphinx test vectors take up most of

1040
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,200
the specs

1041
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,280
and and most of the container compute

1042
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,380
time and generating examples in the test

1043
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,599
vectors

1044
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,040
John

1045
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,160
hi yeah I'm just um we had a hackathon

1046
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,400
on the weekend for uh the x509 side of

1047
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,319
things doing exactly this with the PQ

1048
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,780
keys and signatures so I'm wondering

1049
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,520
there's obviously overlap here so we

1050
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,040
should probably talk and you know make

1051
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,200
sure because the object ID is the same

1052
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,700
things that you are bringing up are the

1053
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,960
exact same things that we're dealing

1054
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,060
with plus we're also doing the composite

1055
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,619
so that would be something to also maybe

1056
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:51,780
considered for this yeah ABS absolutely

1057
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,760
and uh also appreciate all your inputs

1058
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,160
on the entry stuff we're working on and

1059
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,720
um I'm very thankful that we're having

1060
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,460
conversations and have like a mailing

1061
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,319
list for this stuff because it's new and

1062
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:03,359
we need to cross communicate on this so

1063
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,619
thanks again for your support on this

1064
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:06,599
what what working groups and or

1065
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,579
individuals who are doing this work in

1066
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,460
the context of X7 on yeah it's mainly

1067
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,440
people from the lamps working group

1068
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,300
because it's dealing with the pki

1069
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,099
artifacts that was where we started from

1070
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,920
but obviously PQ goes beyond just the

1071
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,780
pki artifacts right it goes everywhere

1072
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,859
so

1073
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,300
um and so there was actually a side

1074
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,800
meeting yesterday too about talking

1075
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,380
about a PQ side working group and

1076
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,000
putting together a charter for all that

1077
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,520
so yeah I guess we'll see how that that

1078
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,920
continues so yeah and in a quick context

1079
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,359
for those who might not know Michael

1080
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:38,640
Osborne and Christine Klosterman are

1081
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,040
co-authors on this who uh authored kind

1082
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,380
of the root level stuff over at uh the

1083
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,060
lamps side of things so we're in very

1084
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,800
close communication with both of them on

1085
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,260
pretty much a weekly basis okay but yeah

1086
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,119
yeah in terms of our hackathon like

1087
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,619
we're going to have we're going to

1088
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:55,380
continue to work so we can invite we're

1089
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,660
happy to if we people want to test Koji

1090
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,940
artifacts or whatever with us we're

1091
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,380
having monthly meetings I sent that to

1092
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,599
the labs mailing list I could send it to

1093
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,040
this mailing list and invite people to

1094
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,839
if they want to participate because I'm

1095
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,339
trying to come up with a framework for

1096
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,560
automated testing and to make sure all

1097
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,900
these these new things work together so

1098
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,940
so I'll do that then awesome thank you

1099
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,720
thank you Ori and then we'll cut the cue

1100
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,880
just just to say that Mike and I and

1101
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,040
others have all had conversations around

1102
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,079
the key representations and the

1103
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:27,300
encryption side of this and if the

1104
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,579
working group desires for us to you know

1105
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:32,280
create two new documents in addition to

1106
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,260
splitting these ones out I don't think

1107
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,300
it's tremendous amount of work and be

1108
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:40,099
happy to help support that initiative

1109
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,740
any closing remarks otherwise we will go

1110
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,720
to Hank no just really appreciate all

1111
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,579
the time and especially the support is a

1112
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,500
uh comparatively new author compared to

1113
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,520
some of the people that actually know

1114
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,900
what they're doing in this room so thank

1115
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,140
you all

1116
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,339
foreign

1117
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,760
he can explain why that happened but

1118
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,780
anyways so I'm Mike sorry hello oops

1119
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,940
um yes

1120
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,160
um I'm Mike I'm part of this git working

1121
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,400
group that's been very newly formed

1122
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,720
um some of you probably don't even know

1123
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,859
it

1124
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:33,500
um it's it's supply chain Integrity

1125
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,579
transparency interest

1126
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:40,140
working group we have our uh first real

1127
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,480
session on Thursdays we're happy to to

1128
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,920
join

1129
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,160
um we wanted to

1130
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,920
um discuss one specific Topic in this

1131
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,660
group here

1132
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,660
and that's around the transparency

1133
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,900
aspect of it so if you know transparency

1134
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,520
logs you know for certificate

1135
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,760
transparency for example they all have

1136
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,660
um specific formats on how to represent

1137
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,760
um you know sign tree heads inclusion

1138
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,160
proofs and all of that and this again

1139
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,200
now becomes a topic for more General

1140
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,420
Supply Chain transparency

1141
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,420
and so as part of the skid working group

1142
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,240
um we defined uh well an early

1143
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,880
definition of what we call a receipt and

1144
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,980
that's basically a bundle of

1145
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,200
um assigned tree head and an inclusion

1146
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,480
proof

1147
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,200
for

1148
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,720
counter signature leaves so what does it

1149
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,500
mean

1150
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,740
um it means you have a a cozy sign one

1151
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,800
message that's your supply chain

1152
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,319
um in a way artifact and then

1153
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:46,440
um or statement I should say and then

1154
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,260
um that becomes part of a transparency

1155
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,980
log and so you bind those two together

1156
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,319
with a

1157
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,160
counter-sense structure for example

1158
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,460
that's defined and cozy

1159
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,380
um

1160
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,300
so I'm not I don't want to say too much

1161
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,920
about the details

1162
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,440
um so I

1163
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,240
I think the main point that I want to

1164
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,819
say here is

1165
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:12,359
um

1166
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,420
we defined this new thing that's called

1167
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,200
receipt and it doesn't neatly fit into

1168
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,660
any existing cozy structures so it's a

1169
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,619
new thing

1170
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,059
and I think maybe you're switching to

1171
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:25,440
the next slide actually makes more sense

1172
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,240
here

1173
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,740
so

1174
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,559
we had an early attempt on trying to

1175
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:33,359
shoehorn receipts and all the

1176
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,640
transparency bits into a signature

1177
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,980
algorithm and essentially reusing cozy

1178
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,119
as it is

1179
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,980
that was not well received in the

1180
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,920
community because it was essentially a

1181
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,720
bit of an abuse of what the signature

1182
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,359
algorithm means and it was just too much

1183
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,420
so a better approach is just treat it as

1184
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,839
a separate thing and you know there's

1185
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,460
this whole transparency aspect to it

1186
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,559
when we don't want to hide it and that

1187
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,200
is an inclusion proof and it makes sense

1188
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,280
to

1189
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,920
you know expose that to the to the top

1190
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,720
essentially

1191
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,079
so and I guess what we're asking the the

1192
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,119
Cozy group is

1193
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:14,880
um does this make sense in principle

1194
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,680
um and then I guess there's a question

1195
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,440
of the the Registries that cozy has so

1196
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,200
where would that fit in exactly

1197
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,640
um would there have to be maybe a new

1198
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,380
registry for

1199
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,200
things that are maybe parametrized in

1200
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,440
our case so one example is that there's

1201
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,900
not just a single type of

1202
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,660
you know Ledger or transparency log they

1203
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,579
have slightly different

1204
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:40,680
um you know let's say Mercury algorithms

1205
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,200
and so there has to be some some way to

1206
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,859
to express that and yeah so there must

1207
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:49,559
be some kind of algorithm or Ledger type

1208
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,900
um and I think that goes a bit uh back

1209
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,599
to the to the remark earlier that was on

1210
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,640
um ciphos tweets you know shouldn't be a

1211
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,099
single long thing or should it be a bit

1212
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,599
split up

1213
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:03,059
but anyway these are kind of details and

1214
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:05,760
I guess yeah I have just one minute so

1215
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,260
that's

1216
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,180
um so think about that I don't think we

1217
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,339
want an answer now but also join us at

1218
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:13,800
skit and maybe

1219
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,040
um yeah and we've we've got five minutes

1220
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,180
that you

1221
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,300
you can use some of that if you want

1222
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,819
is this 40 seconds

1223
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:26,700
yes we have uh five minutes of all other

1224
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,839
business with no claimants yet okay good

1225
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:33,180
thank you so so finish in a natural way

1226
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,940
okay so that was this one topic I don't

1227
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,319
know if you already want to get some

1228
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:39,000
feedback because this is a completely

1229
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,720
separate topic

1230
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,839
um

1231
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,920
Hank so what's up this is Hank just

1232
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,740
quickly um on the receipt

1233
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,660
um so that definitely is a core element

1234
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,079
in the um the base work we are doing in

1235
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,800
skit and and we we really need this in

1236
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,339
cozy so uh we will do this as

1237
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:07,260
um individual document here very

1238
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,300
transparently we hope for our comment

1239
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,099
we'll be talking to Russ a lot so so you

1240
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:12,960
warned us for the biggest caveat so

1241
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,819
that's why we are where we are and we

1242
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:17,400
will create a stable proposal how this

1243
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,579
looks like and then I hope uh if

1244
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,980
everybody is satisfied enough that we

1245
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,540
can actually ask for adoption but this

1246
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,880
is it's not this this is not yet but but

1247
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,920
Sooners actually I think so that's just

1248
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,900
my comment that we want to proceed with

1249
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,800
this

1250
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,040
um not in a in a slow pace but actually

1251
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,740
want to have a first uh stable thing

1252
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,240
that is adoptable very soon

1253
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:45,960
um okay so let's go to the other topic

1254
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,240
okay so now clear everything you had on

1255
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,479
your mind

1256
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,760
um a very separate thing

1257
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,460
um probably most of you know about

1258
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,160
timestamp tokens than the whole thing

1259
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:03,059
uh they're mostly used to

1260
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:05,640
you know in things like signed a

1261
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,119
software packages used in Microsoft

1262
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,619
authenticode

1263
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:13,680
but also for signing documents PDFs so

1264
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,480
it's just to make

1265
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,540
good use cases to make um the

1266
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,900
verification of a signed document be

1267
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,520
valid for longer than the original

1268
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,220
certificate was valid for

1269
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,160
so the idea here is cozy doesn't have a

1270
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,260
header parameter that allows to embed

1271
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,180
timestamp tokens in the unprotected

1272
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,040
header so this is simply

1273
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,520
a proposal to say let's define the code

1274
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,380
point and

1275
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,520
um including you know how to actually

1276
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,220
what to do with that how to embed it

1277
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,619
and then applications can use that to

1278
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:52,859
timestamp Cozy messages so it's very

1279
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:54,540
simple

1280
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,420
um so clarification question did you say

1281
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,540
unprotected header yes because it is a

1282
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,460
counter signature by Nature

1283
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,859
and that's why it can't be in the so

1284
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:06,240
first you have to do the signature and

1285
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,800
then the timestamp is against the

1286
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,619
signature bytes okay Russ is nodding out

1287
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:15,079
in the peanut gallery there thank you

1288
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,319
anyone want to join the queue or provide

1289
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:21,540
feedback

1290
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,540
Hank

1291
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,940
so this is Hank again and and this is a

1292
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,640
comment not actual feedback so this is a

1293
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,540
migration path uh solution we don't want

1294
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,420
to use a tsts forever

1295
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,880
but we accept the fact that they are the

1296
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,040
most common and established thing to use

1297
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,339
today and so uh if we want to uh move to

1298
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:47,040
something cooler like say an Epoch

1299
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,280
marker that's fine or assigned to see

1300
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,619
what time check that's cool but for now

1301
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:54,839
this is I think a necessary solution

1302
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:56,760
when you want to use infrastructure that

1303
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,359
is in place and that's why this uh could

1304
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:03,960
be perceived as a mid

1305
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,780
term

1306
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,980
migration path solution

1307
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,099
but if we don't standardize it oh just

1308
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,579
random

1309
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,240
that's all right all right

1310
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,480
thank you we are one minute from time I

1311
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,299
appreciate all the engagement today

1312
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:27,119
as does Evo and we look forward to

1313
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,520
seeing you all on the list thank you for

1314
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,700
coming

1315
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,819
okay

1316
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:50,240
hello

1317
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:56,058
everybody

1318
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,339
thank you

1319
00:59:58,339 --> 01:00:01,880
for taking notes

1320
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:12,500
like most of my comments

1321
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,920
assert representation

1322
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,859
how do we update those two do we update

1323
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:34,740
those two in this graph or we make a

1324
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,020
separate draft with

1325
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:40,200
to get updates to go to uh

1326
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,839
what are those two rfcs do one of them

1327
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,740
is for brain games

1328
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,180
which has also different certificate

1329
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,480
types

1330
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,619
I just just sent it to Village I

1331
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:25,940
actually sent a list back in July

1332
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:36,200
and it's a value to me Pacific I think

1333
01:01:37,579 --> 01:01:41,359
dance with me yes

1334
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,780
but but that makes

1335
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,500
your ass updated

1336
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,420
saying you want to send this to the

1337
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,980
others we have these two resource

1338
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,960
records where certificates are held

1339
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,280
right now

1340
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,420
um

1341
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,660
in mind

1342
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,200
thank you
