and be professional with each other of

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,619
course it's okay to have good technical

28
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,220
argument but uh please keep it uh at the

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,780
at the technical and professional level

30
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,340
and of course we have a document

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,560
governing that too TCP 54 next

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,140
for those in the room we ask two things

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,680
the first is please scan the QR code

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,399
joining join the online Tool uh whether

35
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,680
you use the phone or the the

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,200
computer it's really important because

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,820
of two things it gives us our blue

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,040
sheets it also allows you to participate

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,340
in polling and we will conduct some

40
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,300
polls later in the uh the session and

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,400
we'll do that versus raising hands or

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,800
humming so that we are Equitable to the

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,020
people who are remote so they can

44
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,120
participate at the same level

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,920
for remote participants you're here

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,080
thanks so much for joining and please

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,400
meet your mics if you're not speaking

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,599
the only additional piece of information

49
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,900
on on this slide really is uh come join

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,180
us on joint minute taking

51
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,720
so we use Hedgehog ether pad whatever

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,580
you want to call it it's a it's a

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,200
collaborative tool where everyone can

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,540
make sure that we're capturing the

55
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,640
conversation and the discussion that

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,260
happens you don't have to capture the

57
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,060
material on the slides that's already on

58
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,560
the slides and we have YouTube available

59
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,300
but for the discussion it's really

60
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,459
important to help capture

61
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,000
um uh the uh

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,599
capture the discussion going back to the

63
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,480
um going back to the uh scanning in for

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,160
on-site I forgot to mention the other

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,980
bullet that's on here is the ietf

66
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,440
requests and requires that you wear a

67
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,200
mask in the room and the only time you

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,879
should take it off is if you're at the

69
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,739
front talking

70
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,920
when you um speak at the mic please make

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,640
sure you give your name before speaking

72
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,319
because the people who are taking notes

73
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,720
and people who are remote often have a

74
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,180
hard time distinguishing voices in their

75
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,220
current environment and we are going to

76
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,400
use the meat Echo queue for controlling

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,819
uh discussion so if you want to come

78
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,620
speak at the mic please enter the queue

79
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,200
and that allows us to make sure that

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,060
we're taking remote comments at the same

81
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,879
levels in the room comments next please

82
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,379
so what are we doing here

83
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,819
uh you're going to hear in a moment

84
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,940
about the uh problem we're trying to

85
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,700
solve but from sort of the

86
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,379
administrative side we're trying to

87
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,599
answer a few questions

88
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,120
um first what's that problem uh Rick is

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,879
going to talk about that

90
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,860
um and then we also are going to follow

91
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,340
up the the problem statement with some

92
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,320
use cases that really drives our

93
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,579
requirements

94
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,680
helps us better understand the problem

95
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,358
we're solving

96
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,340
eventually we have to figure out what

97
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,740
new work is to be done where the gaps

98
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,199
are in the existing Technologies

99
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,040
and that's those two are sort of the

100
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,280
main purposes of the discussion

101
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,259
but from a uh management standpoint from

102
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,919
the isg from the IAB a very important

103
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,080
question is is there sufficient interest

104
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,620
in working on this problem at the ietf

105
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,600
so at the end we are going to have a

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,820
poll that says are you interested in in

107
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,800
this topic and are you willing to work

108
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,699
on it

109
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,560
and ultimately those are the questions

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,060
we're here to answer

111
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,979
so yes we want to understand why we're

112
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,259
here what problem we're solving but from

113
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,120
an ietf standpoint do we have enough

114
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,460
people to work on it yeah not not just

115
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,740
what you're interested in but please if

116
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,000
you're willing to work on it if you're

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,100
just interested in the problem that's

118
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,600
not really useful to us so it's really

119
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,340
much more useful is yeah we're willing

120
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,040
to write drafts edit drafts do code

121
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,919
whatever is needed

122
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,800
next

123
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
so we have a posted agenda the agenda is

124
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,699
a little different today than it was uh

125
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,039
yesterday or the day before

126
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,039
um uh basically we got a little more

127
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,479
information

128
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,180
um uh and some additional contributions

129
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,759
that's always really appreciated as a

130
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,979
contribution-driven organization

131
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,380
one thing I want to say about the time

132
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,979
here these are approximate times we have

133
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,400
a good 30 25 minutes for discussion if

134
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,520
that discussion happens earlier uh in

135
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,220
the session that's okay we don't have to

136
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,400
be completely rigid to these times we

137
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
will sort of manage the cues manage the

138
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,780
discussion so we can cover all the

139
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,960
topics but if we have a lot of

140
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,979
discussion let's say on the problem

141
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,919
statement will you can we'll let that go

142
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,020
over and we'll just take from that open

143
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,500
discussion time

144
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,180
and with that we're going to jump over

145
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,900
to the next

146
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,720
Rick Taylor is going to talk about the

147
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,259
problem statement

148
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,380
morning all oh that's very loud good

149
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,340
morning all

150
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,680
um so

151
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,380
I have a published problem statement

152
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,380
which I'm not hugely proud of it was

153
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,759
pretty much a stream of Consciousness

154
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,180
done pretty quickly and off the back of

155
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,580
that had very productive meetings with a

156
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,900
number of people who picked up on that

157
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,280
there was good correspondence on the

158
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,080
mailing list and I want to call out

159
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,360
Adrian for taking me to one side

160
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,160
yesterday and saying let's drill this

161
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,199
down to something a bit more short and

162
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,720
tight and that really hasn't been

163
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,419
updated yet and is kind of the content

164
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,580
that I will come up with at the very end

165
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,520
of this slide deck but meanwhile uh can

166
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,479
we have the first slide please

167
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,819
so I'm going to jump straight into the

168
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,199
meat of it

169
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,620
as I and several other people we have

170
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,960
chatted to

171
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,099
see it there is the following problem

172
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,039
we understand that in routing

173
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,440
you have nodes you have links they come

174
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,840
they go you need a protocol to try and

175
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,520
build some sort of topology so that you

176
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,199
can build end-to-end paths across these

177
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,819
Networks

178
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,919
we can do that fairly effectively at the

179
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,699
moment

180
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,039
but in general

181
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,020
we believe as we're building those

182
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,300
protocols that we must react to failures

183
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,039
in these links in order to recover in

184
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,360
order to maintain this topology

185
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,220
what we are discussing here is the

186
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,400
proposal that maybe there is another

187
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,080
case here which is these links and these

188
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,380
nodes may change in predictable or

189
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,599
scheduleable ways

190
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,080
so you can know with a certain degree of

191
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,259
confidence in advance of a break or a

192
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,080
restoration in link adjacency or

193
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,740
whatever that it's going to happen

194
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,940
therefore as a routing protocol

195
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,240
implementation or a protocol design you

196
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,820
don't have to react to it happening oh

197
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,159
my God my Link's just gone you can say

198
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,039
oh at 12 pm on Wednesday that Link's

199
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,560
going so I can pre-compute an

200
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,600
alternative or I can keep a backup

201
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,120
topology ready to apply or I can do

202
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,040
smart things and I'm not entirely sure

203
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,839
personally what all of those smart

204
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,300
things are but I would see that as an

205
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,339
interesting area to investigate

206
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,580
so that when that scheduled event occurs

207
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,160
you are ready to do it

208
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,660
and you can move swiftly on without

209
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,180
losing end-to-end connectivity your

210
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,820
traffic can flow less disruption Etc so

211
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,540
next slide please

212
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,500
so I'll give you a second just to read

213
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,260
through this a little bit but

214
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,080
the obvious answer to that statement is

215
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,519
people come back and say well actually

216
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,440
routing protocols already handle

217
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,540
convergence when we lose links when

218
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,019
nodes fail and in general that

219
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,700
convergence is fast enough and fast

220
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,500
re-route mechanisms exist and they're

221
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,480
good we've worked on this for donkey's

222
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,880
years within the IDF we've got a good

223
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,560
Suite of protocols that will pretty much

224
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,720
do this

225
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,140
but as I've said before rooting does not

226
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,760
currently handle the potential

227
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,980
connectivity represented by root nodes

228
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,980
and links that are scheduled to turn up

229
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,200
in the future or are scheduled to

230
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,300
disappear so you know it's going to

231
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,940
happen it just hasn't happened yet and I

232
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,620
personally see that as a critical

233
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,360
difference

234
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,580
so

235
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,320
and that third point is basically an

236
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,300
extension of that which is not only do

237
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,339
we uh we don't handle the fact that we

238
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,959
know a node is going to appear or links

239
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,000
are going to become available we also

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,140
don't handle the fact that we know

241
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,459
they're going to disappear as well by

242
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,640
extension next slide please

243
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,819
foreign

244
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,300
so the problem is if we think there is a

245
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,040
use here for having this a priori in

246
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,560
advance knowledge of changes to the

247
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,480
connectivity and the adjacency and the

248
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,760
availability of the individual nodes

249
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
that make up the network over which

250
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
we're building an end-to-end a set of

251
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,459
end-to-end paths

252
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,100
how would we solve that

253
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,440
do we understand that there is a problem

254
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,060
to be solved here because again this is

255
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,620
problems so

256
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,560
how does a nodal link that is not up

257
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,140
have its presence advertised how do we

258
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,600
inform a routing protocol that something

259
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,279
is going to occur in the future and

260
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,540
how if we can say it's coming can we

261
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,760
also include how long is it going to be

262
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,440
up for

263
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,060
and equally the converse so can you say

264
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,459
at this point in time something is going

265
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,440
to happen either an availability is

266
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,320
going to arrive or a link is going to

267
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,000
disappear so therefore service will not

268
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
be available across that adjacency how

269
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,800
long is it going to be for and will this

270
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,980
repeat will this recur how long does

271
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,740
this whole description of forthcoming

272
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,980
events going to be valid for so we're

273
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,339
sort of starting to talk about

274
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,860
possible to describe a schedule and

275
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,180
that's the word I'm using at the moment

276
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,980
I'm not trying to impose any words onto

277
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,720
any any future solution to this problem

278
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,260
but can we talk about schedules

279
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,880
forthcoming events

280
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,640
and is that of use to routing protocols

281
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,300
do we see advantage of doing that

282
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,540
the follow-on question for that is if we

283
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,540
see available and unavailable as one of

284
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,339
the things you would describe in that

285
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,600
schedule

286
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,200
could we say well availability could

287
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,079
just be seen as a Boolean metric up down

288
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,060
could we say

289
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,120
change link costs you know whatever the

290
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,279
waiting you're using to build your your

291
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,079
shortest path across your available

292
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,339
graph

293
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,060
could we say at some point in time the

294
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,760
cost of this link is going to change

295
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,320
so you can go and run your dixtra

296
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,300
algorithm well in advance of this and

297
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,940
say well I know when that time occurs I

298
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,440
should probably my shortest path tree is

299
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,000
now something completely different I

300
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,019
could pre-do that work

301
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,360
next slide please okay so this is the

302
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,339
full text and I'm not going to go

303
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,200
through it again I've broken out the key

304
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,200
points in the previous three slides but

305
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
that's there so please grab it read it

306
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,839
through my intention is to

307
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,779
um work with Adrian to reintegrate this

308
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,240
text into the existing problem statement

309
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,420
and to update it if there is a general

310
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,160
consensus that we want to continue

311
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,899
working on this and there is such a

312
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,300
thing I apologize I didn't have time to

313
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,600
get this back up onto GitHub etc etc

314
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,380
and I believe that is the last slide

315
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,600
because I've split this to talk about

316
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,779
existing Technologies and a bit of

317
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:34,800
scoping

318
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,240
to go later in the agenda

319
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,560
Kevin is heading to the mic

320
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,019
call one

321
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,779
uh hi Kevin fall did a little work in

322
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,100
this area

323
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,079
about 10 years ago

324
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,480
um I just wanted to just some comments

325
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,820
uh observations so interestingly uh you

326
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,579
know we can trace rooting we do in sort

327
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,320
of internet and whatever to some work

328
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,339
that had been done you mentioned

329
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,680
dijkstra algorithm for example

330
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,500
so 1958 there's a publication flows over

331
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,260
time for Ford from Ford Fulkerson which

332
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,200
is the same origin story that we have

333
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,240
for you know regular kind of rooting

334
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,459
protocols so I think when I first came

335
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,019
across that text it was interesting to

336
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,240
me that it was really so old

337
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,519
um but just some other comments that I

338
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,200
would concur with you it's it's sort of

339
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,839
a different problem space from a kind of

340
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,459
the graph theoretic point of view

341
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,200
because you have a time Dimension and

342
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,160
all of that

343
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,440
whether it's useful in this context that

344
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,019
that's an important uh sort of debate to

345
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,760
have but uh I guess I would just say

346
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,540
that there is a lot of academic work in

347
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,180
this area but it uses words that we

348
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,120
don't tend to use here and it also just

349
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,100
one other little thing sort of meta

350
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,199
thought about rooting you know when I

351
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,220
went through school and learned about

352
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,079
rooting it was presented like you know

353
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,660
here's link State here's whatever

354
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,420
distance Vector Etc but there's another

355
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,560
whole

356
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,079
world that looks at the same problems

357
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,699
which was the operations research

358
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,519
community and their research and its

359
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,199
optimization problems and they're

360
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,579
they're duels they're really the same

361
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,639
kind of problems in many cases and so if

362
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,220
you the the other kinds of interesting

363
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,199
work that relate to this that probably

364
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,660
is not an ietf scope but just to give

365
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,339
you some thinking is like Dynamic

366
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,019
transshipment problem things like this

367
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,600
is where you have um you know warehouses

368
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,240
and highways and the highways are fast

369
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,100
or slow and the way arrow and the

370
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,380
warehouses have so much capacity and you

371
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,180
need to get certain you know Commodities

372
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,339
from one place to another and and those

373
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,079
were the types of

374
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,820
work that we were thinking about

375
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,459
whatever 10 years ago when like oh we

376
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,079
have links that come and go but what's

377
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,120
going to happen with the data we care

378
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,339
about if it has to go a long way maybe

379
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,240
it has to camp out somewhere and so if

380
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,680
you know that's a pretty different thing

381
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,480
than what internet architecture usually

382
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,639
does but you can imagine a world and I

383
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,139
think Dave Clark said this one's like oh

384
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,760
at one point we were thinking that

385
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,680
packets could just live in a buffer for

386
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,579
a day

387
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,100
okay so just I don't know if any of

388
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,839
that's going to be but I just want to

389
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,459
sort of throw out there's a rich area

390
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,560
that that we don't normally tread in

391
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,959
here in this place two quick answers

392
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,540
first off I think the the presence of

393
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,519
existing research in this area is a

394
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,040
really good thing because

395
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,019
I always worry when I think of something

396
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,699
and everyone says that's unique no one's

397
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:30,839
ever thought of that it probably means

398
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,699
it's really dumb so the fact that other

399
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,160
people have been spending eight years

400
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,019
decades researching this stuff I think

401
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,060
that's really useful and second of all

402
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,100
I'm gonna come back to a bit of the

403
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,259
technology piece and look at some of the

404
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,519
Gap analysis stuff in a later

405
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,139
presentation it's we've scheduled it in

406
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,180
Fairly bite-sized chunks and you're

407
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,459
right there's what we do in the internet

408
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,740
area particularly in pretty stable

409
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,480
networks that we're all pretty familiar

410
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,339
with there's the whole Mani piece I want

411
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,420
to talk about where there's a different

412
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,100
approach and you're right the the kind

413
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,779
of generic traveling salesman problems

414
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,820
the resource scheduling across routes

415
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,459
that are not traffic based there's a

416
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,559
whole wealth of stuff there and

417
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,839
having some kind of timetable I mean

418
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,939
think about railway systems they have a

419
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,559
timetable so you know where to get there

420
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,299
get to the station at this time because

421
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,500
that's when the train is going to be

422
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,799
there see if the internet goes on strike

423
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,679
don't go there just as a heads up we do

424
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,240
have some extra time for discussion but

425
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,859
okay so do we have eight people in the

426
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,140
queue so we should keep things moving

427
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,640
along it's good to get the points but

428
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,520
let's not spend the whole time on one

429
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,160
so this is Alex Clem futureway I have

430
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,140
one question to the problem statement so

431
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,640
I understand the basic premise of this

432
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
but I think the second part is missing

433
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,900
namely what you're actually planning to

434
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,640
do with this information so assuming

435
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,260
that you had this solved how will you

436
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,900
leverage it how will this be better what

437
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,000
problems do you solve better by knowing

438
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,940
the schedule Advance versus having to

439
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,360
reconverge or or what have you so no I

440
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,740
did not really see this explicitly

441
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,380
mentioned maybe it's implied in your

442
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,240
mind but I think it would be helpful to

443
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,580
be explicit about that

444
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,400
Fair criticism you're right that first

445
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,900
off the problem statement can be much

446
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,140
better but the quick answer is I think

447
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,419
there is an opportunity if we know

448
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,360
something is going to change in advance

449
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,539
then we don't waste time and possibly

450
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,419
precious resources trying to work out

451
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,340
why it failed trying to bring it back

452
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,799
because you know it has gone no need to

453
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,679
try and restore that peer link no need

454
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,400
so that's one opportunity to not waste

455
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,780
scarce resources and the other

456
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,120
opportunity is if you know something is

457
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,460
going to happen in advance you can do

458
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,200
that calculation as a low priority

459
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,580
because you know how long you've got to

460
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,260
do it if particularly when we look at

461
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,500
iot anything in space you know General

462
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,440
resource constrained things anything we

463
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,380
can do to save on conservation so if we

464
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,760
know something is going to change we can

465
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,160
do the calculation now rather than have

466
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,260
to rush a reaction to something

467
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,260
happening we can be sensible about the

468
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,179
resources we allot to make making that

469
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,980
change because we knew it was about to

470
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,700
happen

471
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,020
right we're going to move on to Tony

472
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,820
go ahead

473
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,659
Juniper

474
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,720
um sounds like we've got an echo

475
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,700
sorry about that

476
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,440
go ahead

477
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,860
so my concern is something we raised on

478
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,660
the mailing list which is are we

479
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,059
covering Dynamic topology

480
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,000
I think if we are not covering Dynamic

481
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,240
topology then the problem is relatively

482
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,340
straightforward we already have

483
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,520
techniques for dealing with links that

484
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,020
we think we're going to take out of

485
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,100
service

486
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,679
and being able to do that on a schedule

487
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,360
is sounds like it's pretty

488
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,240
straightforward

489
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,200
if we

490
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,320
are planning on bringing links up then

491
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,380
we have a question that was not dealt

492
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,600
with on the mailing list which is do we

493
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,880
wait for actual liveness information to

494
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,260
propagate a if the link is scheduled to

495
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,200
come up does it actually come up 100 of

496
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
the time at the scheduled time

497
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,059
so that seems like an important question

498
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,940
focus on the dynamic topology question

499
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,380
thanks Tony I'll try and answer some of

500
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,480
those quite quickly so I'll start with

501
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,700
the second point which is

502
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,100
if a schedule says a link is going to be

503
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,260
up do we always believe it I think would

504
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,940
be a mistake

505
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,160
um I think experience tells us that you

506
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,900
always have to deal with exceptions you

507
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,220
always have to deal with unpredictable

508
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,320
failures we do that with all the routing

509
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,880
protocols from across the entire

510
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,640
spectrum of dynamic to to very stable

511
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,380
environments

512
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,059
so I'm not suggesting that you

513
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,340
that you don't expect failures if you

514
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,919
have a schedule I think that's naive

515
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,980
um the dynamic question so that's a

516
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,660
scoping question

517
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,120
um my gut tells me you try and start

518
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,039
with the simple cases and then expand

519
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,260
out to the more complex ones whilst when

520
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,760
you have a better handle about your

521
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,980
approaches but that doesn't mean you

522
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,559
don't discount more complex cases while

523
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,080
you're looking at your simple solution

524
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,080
that is a very

525
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,640
politicians answer to that question yeah

526
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,440
I think that you might have uh

527
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,820
missed each other because you have on

528
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,380
your slide I think the answer to his

529
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,020
question which is dynamic topology is in

530
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,240
scope and that's represented by that T2

531
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,840
and T4 is at T2 you had a break along

532
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,720
that path and then at T4 it comes up to

533
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,059
a different

534
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,039
technology goes somewhere else so and

535
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,260
Tony you can jump back in and answer if

536
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,760
I get that wrong but I think that's what

537
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,340
you meant by Dynamic topology so there's

538
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,320
a chain not only is there a change in

539
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,419
link status that's scheduled that

540
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:04,799
there's also a change in who you're

541
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,940
talking to

542
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,700
yeah no no if if that is our definition

543
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,120
of dynamic then yes absolutely I come

544
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,919
from a Manet background where Dynamic

545
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,159
can mean almost chaotic and those edge

546
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,200
cases I would suggest still remain out

547
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,120
of Scope when everything is moving at

548
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,039
such speed or your schedule is talking

549
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,620
about nanoseconds and the predictability

550
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,780
of this stuff becomes very low

551
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,240
probability I think we disappear into a

552
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,299
corner case we shouldn't go in but yeah

553
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,580
links up links down nodes coming online

554
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,559
nodes moving relative to each other

555
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,080
within a potential topology that level

556
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,960
of dynamism absolutely

557
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,360
if it is if it has corresponding

558
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,020
predictability

559
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,659
ah thank you yeah I just wanted to make

560
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,940
a comment from a really a comment from a

561
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,340
colleague of mine which I think echoes a

562
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,720
comment that was made at the mic earlier

563
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,299
and also by you Rick that uh it's like a

564
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,159
bus scheduling or train scheduling or

565
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,380
you know using a Maps app uh it's

566
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,140
related to driving directions but it you

567
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,820
know but it's also sufficiently

568
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,460
different that it warrants uh a special

569
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,500
look and so for the purposes of like

570
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,179
buff working group formation I think

571
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,340
it's uh it's worth recognizing those

572
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,500
differences and and uh

573
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,299
having a dedicated space to concentrate

574
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,900
efforts on that

575
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:30,320
brilliant thank you

576
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,620
Julian

577
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,659
Julian luchak so this buff is actually

578
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,820
quite timely for me because I came

579
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,100
across a

580
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,840
situation recently as follows so you

581
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,460
have a network

582
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,440
um in which there are a number of remote

583
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,020
sites and so

584
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,400
um in the main particle Network let's

585
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,080
say you've got a router R1 which is

586
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,360
connected to a remote site and in remote

587
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,400
sites you've got routers R2 and R3

588
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,100
facing the main network but there's only

589
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,700
one fiber connection into that site and

590
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,980
so what you've got is a

591
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,860
um a fiber switch in the site that

592
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,440
connects to fiberlink normally into R2

593
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,880
on that site so I went up is normally

594
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,820
connected to R2 but if R2 should fail

595
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,860
there's some automation that makes the

596
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,679
switch flick over to R3 now while two

597
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,559
and R3 are connected to each other and

598
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,720
there's some other reasons behind so R2

599
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,760
sorry R3 knows as much about the

600
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,039
topology as R2 does even though it's not

601
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,600
connected at the moment to the main site

602
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,500
and so it with current you know know

603
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,000
protocols and so on it's frustrating

604
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,320
that

605
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,880
um you know to take a vote of a few

606
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,760
seconds for you know R2 to come up the

607
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,380
protocols to come up

608
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,600
Etc so this you know sort of chimes in

609
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,120
you know very well with that scenario in

610
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,880
fact thank you so that's that I think is

611
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,140
yet another example of of reducing the

612
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,419
the loss of of data transmission

613
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,960
capability when something has happened

614
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,940
if you can know it's happened in advance

615
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,740
then you can say well as soon as that

616
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,020
goes I know what I it was expected

617
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,679
that's due to R3 r3's warm standby and

618
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,900
ready for it rather than coming from

619
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,419
cold it's and I know that existing

620
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,240
protocols have mechanisms to make this

621
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,299
work and I it just

622
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,120
genuinely I don't know if this isn't

623
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,120
solved and if sufficient people stand up

624
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,860
and say we've got solutions to this I

625
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,240
will be very happy

626
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,640
but I don't think we do or I might not

627
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,140
understand so thanks

628
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,240
Andrew

629
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,700
hi Andrew from liquid intelligent

630
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,440
Technologies

631
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,020
so I live in a part of the world where

632
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,779
power is not always the most stable

633
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,400
um luckily in Kenya it's more stable

634
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,960
than my colleague from South Africa I

635
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,340
think he brought the parachute load

636
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,080
shedding with him with it when we

637
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,159
arrived

638
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,500
but here's the thing

639
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,000
yes

640
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,640
I can say the thing's going to go down

641
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,140
we've got the fast reroute Etc however

642
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,740
if I get an outage and I know that this

643
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,159
is power or has a good probability of

644
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,679
being power based on the schedule and

645
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm just interestingly enough was

646
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,440
looking at the load shedding for my

647
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,640
parents house

648
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,059
and they three to five thirteen seven

649
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,260
o'clock to nine thirty blah blah blah

650
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,080
how I'm going to react to that based on

651
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,240
is this power or something much more

652
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,580
temporary how long that power outage

653
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,340
could be could potentially be very

654
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,620
different

655
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,159
um and if for example I've got someone

656
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,299
at the knock in India or in the UK

657
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:52,919
picking this up and looking well it's

658
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:54,720
just another outage I'll quickly balance

659
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,919
this here

660
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,260
that's different to saying I know this

661
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,480
is power my schedule says it's going to

662
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
be out for eight hours it's going to hit

663
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,240
a peak time over here I may want to

664
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,779
rebalance this traffic in a very very

665
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,900
different way

666
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,840
and that makes this really important

667
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,140
that I do have a way in the network to

668
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,080
pick these things up Etc and then make

669
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,700
decisions on that that aren't

670
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,520
necessarily related to some guy's

671
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,640
impression in India who just saw that

672
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,700
the router went down you know so there

673
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,820
are a lot of possibilities here to get

674
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,279
pretty interesting with how you do this

675
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,000
the other thing is if I've got

676
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,220
algorithms that are learning how to

677
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,220
balance traffic when something is down

678
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,299
I can tell that algorithm this is

679
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:54,539
because of power outage learn something

680
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,980
different

681
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,440
versus this thing has just rebooted

682
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,299
itself and may come back at any instance

683
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,299
so there are a lot of possibilities I

684
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,360
see here and yeah I am extremely

685
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,760
interested in this

686
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,080
thanks Andrew

687
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,260
um yeah I think when it comes to the

688
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,580
what's in scope and what's out of scope

689
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,320
if people do think this is a problem we

690
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,120
need to balance

691
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,960
um

692
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,580
I personally don't think we should get

693
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,260
too caught up in how do we create

694
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,600
schedules I think that's kind of beyond

695
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,700
the scope of what's achievable in a in a

696
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,100
reasonable working group schedule

697
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,820
um

698
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,220
there is some really cool stuff we can

699
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,980
do once we have a schedule and I would

700
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,360
and I'm going to get on to this later

701
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,860
but it's more about trying to keep that

702
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,679
scope down but that doesn't mean

703
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,960
other things can't be built that we

704
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,700
consider to be particularly at the scope

705
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,900
of something like a routing working

706
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,900
group but yeah once you've got this data

707
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,100
and you can work out how to get it

708
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,500
around your network and and get it in

709
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,820
the system

710
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,500
there's a lot of cool stuff we could do

711
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,539
with this I think

712
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,360
sorry come on yeah um the cross and

713
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,100
Huawei I asked the question on the on

714
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,860
the on the chat and I I thought I might

715
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,200
relay this here it's called time variant

716
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,600
routing but but I feel there are

717
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,279
different variances we we may want to

718
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,020
consider it came out already before it

719
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,700
may well be energy it may well be

720
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,100
locality you know there's a fine time

721
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,080
variant the the focus on the schedule

722
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,140
very limiting if you will and it turns

723
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,240
you know link is up and down schedules I

724
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,500
put a schedule into the router you're

725
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,559
done but if you have Dynamic conditions

726
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,320
that may be predictable as well

727
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,880
um upon which you actually want to

728
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,740
change your routing I think this you

729
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,640
know creates a much richer space for

730
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,620
probably very very innovative solutions

731
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,100
in the world I take your point

732
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,140
um I'm really trying to stop boiling

733
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,440
oceans here and I do wonder that

734
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,880
um

735
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,460
I don't want to disappear down to a

736
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,000
generic uh uh expression evaluation

737
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
condition causes effect

738
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,860
that's that's that's programming in the

739
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,299
network I think that's still very much

740
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:08,779
the work of the irtf I think if we say

741
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,200
time

742
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,039
things change at a point in time can we

743
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,399
prepare ourselves in advance that

744
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,720
reduces our scope to something

745
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,760
achievable which will have noticeable

746
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,919
benefit I'm not saying everything you

747
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,779
haven't said is not really cool stuff

748
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,899
and would be great to do

749
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,279
just don't think it's achievable

750
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,159
particularly within one bath from a from

751
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,779
an Administration perspective not from

752
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,340
an intelligence or an ambition

753
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,380
perspective thanks Fair Point and just

754
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,659
for clarification I believe it either

755
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,299
comes up later or you've said it earlier

756
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:44,460
that at the time change other parameters

757
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,880
may change like bandwidth yeah yeah so a

758
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,100
scheduled change in energy consumption I

759
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,299
think we've got use cases talking about

760
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:52,919
in fact I know we've got use cases

761
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,779
coming talk about that it's not just on

762
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:59,640
and off it could be we know that uh I

763
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,200
don't I don't know the the atmospherics

764
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,960
are such that our satellite links are

765
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,020
really good until there's a rainstorm

766
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,140
coming in at 3 P.M this afternoon you

767
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,820
you can do a lot with the schedule I do

768
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,799
agree I mean if you if you provide an

769
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,720
API in the scheduled building that's how

770
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,980
we solve some of the problems in the

771
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,020
past but obviously the conditions for

772
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,000
the schedule can be can be exactly along

773
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,039
the dimension that I just mentioned it

774
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,960
could be driven by Energy prices in

775
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,700
order to do carbon aware routing it

776
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,340
could be based on expected movements I

777
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,600
think on the mailing list I sent the

778
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,220
paper around we published 20 odd years

779
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,740
ago on using contextual information I

780
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,720
walked down the house we walked to the

781
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,500
left

782
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,539
I walk to the right right you can boil

783
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,039
this down into the schedule if there was

784
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,640
a proper API into the schedule making

785
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,840
then you can probably go down the route

786
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
that I'm suggesting I I completely agree

787
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,940
and I think that the carve Point here

788
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,140
should be

789
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,740
let's say we have a schedule let's see

790
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,480
if we can Define what that schedule

791
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,200
should have inside it and let's discuss

792
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,179
the kind and I'm getting beyond the

793
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,620
problem statement into what I think the

794
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,480
scoping is so actually I'm going to stop

795
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,720
can we revisit this in my next slide or

796
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,299
my later slide deck

797
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:16,200
and last question so when a uh a node or

798
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,020
a link changes the network transients

799
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,360
and during that transient a lot of

800
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,340
innocent traffic is disrupted yeah

801
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,960
because the formation of micro Loops so

802
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,600
we're going to do this can we include in

803
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,880
the base technology micro loop

804
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,460
prevention in some way or other to try

805
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,320
and minimize this uh this very

806
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,419
disruptive effect the Technologies for

807
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,659
knowing are for doing it are well known

808
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:41,460
absolutely I've seen no reason why that

809
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,919
shouldn't be considered it's that's just

810
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,960
the sort of thing that we can attempt to

811
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,840
avoid if we knew it was coming up we

812
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,860
might be able to use different

813
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,820
techniques to say when we have to make

814
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,820
this change because it is predicted we

815
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,220
can avoid that sort of micro loop

816
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,260
formation or whatever because we can all

817
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,840
look at we being a set of of routers or

818
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,380
whatever we can pre-agree a an alternate

819
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,360
topology to have prepped without those

820
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,220
micro loops and we can pre-agree to make

821
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,960
no no it's not it's not quite as simple

822
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,120
as that right so because you have to

823
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,760
deal with the uh lack of synchronicity

824
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,919
in the changing in the fibs which can

825
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,279
take quite a long time so actually it's

826
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,399
not an instant event changing the

827
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,860
topology but actually a topology change

828
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,960
process that you need to do that takes

829
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,600
you from the old topology uh to the new

830
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,940
topology via a number of short-term

831
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,760
virtual topologies usually

832
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,799
and that sounds absolutely like

833
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,260
something that should be addressed as

834
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,080
part of a TBR working group I think that

835
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,820
would be absolutely a charter item to

836
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,580
say can we in

837
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,480
um general terms describe how one makes

838
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,940
this change such that we avoid these

839
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,320
things and the reason I say general

840
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,460
terms is I don't think it's right that a

841
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,860
potential TBR working group should tell

842
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,080
link state routing what to change in

843
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,379
ospf we should go to ospf and say these

844
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,839
are mechanisms that we talk about go can

845
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,540
you integrate it the the techniques were

846
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,540
investigated quite some years ago now in

847
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,580
um the transport in the routing area

848
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,280
working group so a lot of the techniques

849
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,500
are already documented great let's have

850
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,659
them let's use them

851
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,040
yeah

852
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,679
perfect uh thank you all for a really

853
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,080
good discussion and hopefully we have a

854
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,000
good picture of what the the problem is

855
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
we're trying to solve here

856
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,940
um

857
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,679
that said we're going to look at some

858
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,320
specific use cases and I think they'll

859
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,240
Echo some of the conversation uh Ed

860
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,418
hi my name is Ed and Rick is taller than

861
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,658
me

862
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:57,240
okay so when when Rick and I started

863
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,520
talking about what would time variant

864
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,280
routing uh look like obviously a problem

865
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,440
statement was good but everyone has in

866
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,480
their in their mind a mental model or a

867
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,800
problem that they've encountered and

868
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,720
that they're trying to solve and trying

869
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,460
to bring that down into a series of use

870
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,380
cases was an interesting Endeavor

871
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,599
because we could have two of them or we

872
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,940
could have two thousand of them and how

873
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,619
do we scope and understand what

874
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,180
differences are important to talk about

875
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,339
so what I want to talk about for the

876
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:26,460
next 10 or 15 minutes or so is an

877
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,280
initial take of how we carve out use

878
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,440
cases to identify what we think are the

879
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,320
unique differences that and the expected

880
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,599
benefits in those use cases of something

881
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,900
like TBR time variant information next

882
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,220
slide

883
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,859
so to do that I wanted to to just go

884
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,660
over some background the approach that I

885
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,880
took in laying some of these out based

886
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,980
on the conversations and the working on

887
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,140
the mailing list uh talk a little bit

888
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,579
about some formatting and then go over

889
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,400
what I call sort of the three use cases

890
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,740
which are kind of categories and I'll

891
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,079
name them here and we'll go into them uh

892
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,000
in detail in just a moment

893
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,560
uh the first is cases where nodes change

894
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,300
their functionality

895
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,839
to preserve local resources local

896
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,359
resources like resources local to that

897
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,180
node it's battery power thermal

898
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,880
environment local storage where

899
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,940
preserving that is more important than

900
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,400
some other node functions

901
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,300
another set of use cases are cases where

902
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,060
a node wants to adapt to changing

903
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,280
external conditions

904
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,520
power is really expensive right now data

905
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,680
is really expensive right now it's not a

906
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,720
matter of node survival but it's a

907
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,700
matter of reacting and and working

908
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,800
better in an external environment and

909
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,780
then the last one which is which is one

910
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,640
that is probably very familiar when we

911
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,380
talk about things that change over time

912
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,720
is what happens when nodes in our

913
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,940
Network are moving when they're moving

914
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,859
far away from each other or when they're

915
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:00,300
moving through a difficult environment

916
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,820
or when one just turns a little bit and

917
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,280
can't talk to the other

918
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,500
so next slide

919
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,140
so before we go into those three how did

920
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,700
we get to those three and how are we

921
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,980
going to talk about them so how did we

922
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,720
get to them well obviously we wanted to

923
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,400
constrain anything we talked about to

924
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,800
the problem statement that Rick had just

925
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,560
talked through because this is the

926
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,780
problem that we're trying to solve but

927
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,300
then when we talk about use cases it is

928
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,760
categories of these problems so we say

929
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,740
use cases but the three things that I

930
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,079
just said I believe are categories of

931
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,000
problems or characteristics of problems

932
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,420
and the idea here is that again I don't

933
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,579
want to worry too much about two or

934
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:44,220
three or four instances of the same kind

935
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,200
of problem and calling them different

936
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,300
uh another way of saying it is what we

937
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,920
think here are from a use case

938
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,460
perspective these three are such that a

939
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,300
solution for one Exemplar of that use

940
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,280
case could be a solution for any other

941
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,800
Exemplar within that use case

942
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,200
so the format for this is we want to

943
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,880
Define what they are

944
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,099
we want to list out what the assumptions

945
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,380
are and assumptions here because the use

946
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,240
cases are again a little bit abstract

947
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,839
are what information do we think would

948
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,859
need to be present in order to yield

949
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:21,660
deterministic benefits from having a

950
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,520
predictable schedule

951
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,800
and then the next part is okay well

952
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,740
assuming that we have data that we need

953
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,440
to key off of then what are those

954
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,359
benefits and when we list out those

955
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,339
benefits it's not a and then there will

956
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,020
be a list typically two or three or four

957
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,700
or five it's not that we think we will

958
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,320
get all of them all at once all the time

959
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,780
but maybe you get some combination of

960
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,079
them and in different cases and then

961
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,780
last I'll end each use case with a quick

962
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,300
Exemplar just to try and ground the

963
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,119
thinking but then afterwards we have two

964
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,740
more presentations following this one

965
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,260
that will go into deeper detail on some

966
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,839
more specific exemplars

967
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,700
next and we probably will wait for

968
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,160
discussion until all three presentations

969
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,140
go if you do have something that's just

970
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,760
like a clarifying question that's great

971
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,619
but uh for discussion let's hold it

972
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,000
until the end of the three use cases

973
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,099
thank you I will happily defer

974
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,680
discussions until I'm not on stage so

975
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,020
use case number one uh local resource

976
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,820
preservation I mean this is the idea

977
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,740
where we have nodes that just operate

978
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,320
with limited uh resources either because

979
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,700
they're in a very difficult environment

980
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,040
or because there is some nature of the

981
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,320
node itself uh where it is meant to be

982
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,119
small it is meant to not need a lot of

983
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,440
power it's meant to not have a lot of

984
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,660
storage uh typically smaller things may

985
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,079
be more susceptible to Thermal changes

986
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:42,660
and more importantly the management of

987
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,960
local resources is going to dictate the

988
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,540
function of the node so cases where we

989
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,780
have nodes that will pause non-critical

990
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,079
events to allow the node to stay alive

991
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,060
and on battery life longer to extend the

992
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,820
life of the node or if we know that

993
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,440
something interesting is coming up and

994
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,020
so we want to power things down so that

995
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,300
when that interesting thing happens we

996
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,280
will then be able to do data collection

997
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,760
data exfiltration or if we have to go

998
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,980
into a thermal safe mode or more

999
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,960
interestingly if we do have a relatively

1000
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,460
small amount of storage and that storage

1001
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,220
is filling up maybe that is the time and

1002
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,960
the predicted time when storage may fill

1003
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,520
up when it's time to turn on things like

1004
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,859
radios and start transmitting again

1005
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,140
and then of course the possible benefits

1006
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,560
of this are that if we understand a

1007
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,540
little bit about the future particularly

1008
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,520
as it relates to when links may be going

1009
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,619
up and down we can do a better job of

1010
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:41,599
our own Resource Management next slide

1011
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,220
so for this and the other two use cases

1012
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,900
there are sort of two columns here again

1013
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,339
the assumptions which are on the left

1014
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:50,099
say the better we know these things than

1015
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,560
to the right the possible TBR benefits

1016
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,300
the better we would be able to achieve

1017
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,280
these other things so

1018
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,220
if we assume that we are a resource

1019
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,720
constrained node and if we assume that

1020
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,640
that resource management is important

1021
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,460
and in this category of use cases is

1022
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,619
sort of dominant to node function then

1023
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:10,619
what we would say is it's important in

1024
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,079
these cases to know that our resource

1025
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,140
expenditures are knowable the amount of

1026
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,359
resources consumed by node functions can

1027
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:21,060
be known in advance if I'm managing my

1028
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,400
node functions based on the amount of

1029
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,839
battery life left and I know how to

1030
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,000
transmit a data volume I probably should

1031
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,180
know how much power it is going to take

1032
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,980
or average

1033
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,260
to transmit that if I'm making decisions

1034
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,900
based off these things so we assume that

1035
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,060
that's calculable on the Node or

1036
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,859
knowable on the Node and then the next

1037
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:43,920
piece of that is we assume that the re

1038
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,380
uh the accumulation back of resources

1039
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,900
again using the example of power how

1040
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,820
much we tend to expect to get back a

1041
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,260
battery charge from things like solar

1042
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,320
charging when will that get us back to

1043
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,440
good should also be calculable and then

1044
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,780
the last is that if we're making node

1045
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,520
function decisions based on the

1046
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,220
resources at a node there is an

1047
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,619
assumption that that set of decisions

1048
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,720
and those rubrics or those metrics

1049
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,780
aren't changing so rapidly that within

1050
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,880
any sort of given period of time we're

1051
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,660
not

1052
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,339
um we're not changing our internal cost

1053
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:19,200
functions because if you're if you're

1054
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,180
always looking at a different way of

1055
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,640
managing resources every few minutes or

1056
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,740
every few hours throughout the day it

1057
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,480
becomes more difficult to get

1058
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,700
deterministic benefits back

1059
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,500
from adhering to something like a

1060
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,760
schedule however if if

1061
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,440
knowledge and we've

1062
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,000
only Goods in these situations they do

1063
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,680
understand these things because that is

1064
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,040
their resource management job then you

1065
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,079
get better power savings uh you can get

1066
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,460
better thermal savings you can get

1067
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,020
better storage

1068
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,300
um management uh and and really honestly

1069
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,700
just the data delivery because that's

1070
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,339
what most of this is about continues to

1071
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:57,780
be a little bit better because if you

1072
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,339
can manage your resources better if you

1073
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,260
can stay active in the network better if

1074
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,060
you're not wasting Power by having a

1075
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,740
radio on when you don't think there's a

1076
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,800
likelihood of having a link for example

1077
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,960
then you are you're able to eventually

1078
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,260
get more data through your system

1079
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,540
next slide

1080
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,260
so a graphic uh one here

1081
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,900
is to to come back and say and these are

1082
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,460
taken from the use case documents which

1083
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,700
are published uh as well

1084
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,920
if we were to look at a very contrived

1085
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,020
example of say a three node network node

1086
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,000
one node two node three and we were to

1087
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,280
put a very simple plot that says with

1088
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,440
power on the vertical and time on the

1089
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,780
horizontal that a node would choose to

1090
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,460
keep a radio off

1091
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,099
until such time as it accumulated enough

1092
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,500
power to want to transmit something or

1093
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,380
listen for something then you could put

1094
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,180
some very different plots together for

1095
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,920
nodes that maybe are distributed in a

1096
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,780
particular way and you could see how

1097
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,700
that would change uh underneath of that

1098
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,500
the topology of the network at different

1099
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,540
times time one time two and time three

1100
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,540
so this is something that's uh while

1101
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,579
generic I think we can all come up with

1102
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,859
or understand how this would look in in

1103
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:10,380
actual deployments from an assumptions

1104
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,420
perspective we think you know these

1105
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,920
power graphs are knowable both

1106
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,740
accumulation and expense the resource

1107
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,180
the radio management that sort of

1108
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,040
horizontal line of how much or how

1109
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,579
little isn't changing over time and it

1110
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,680
looks at uh places here where the

1111
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,660
topology itself is is predictable

1112
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,940
scheduleable and likely also

1113
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,220
communicable across other nodes in the

1114
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,339
network

1115
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:36,599
all right

1116
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:39,180
use case two which is now not about

1117
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,980
resource management and preserving node

1118
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,280
function is instead about adapting to

1119
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,619
external conditions and and the idea

1120
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:48,599
behind this is that there is likely some

1121
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:51,540
cost some external costs associated with

1122
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,940
participating in a network and a common

1123
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,920
example of that is use of infrastructure

1124
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,859
use of power infrastructure use of data

1125
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,560
infrastructure nodes that are Wireless

1126
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,900
they will for example use cellular

1127
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,280
infrastructure I think all of us

1128
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,079
understand the idea of one Peak and

1129
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,900
off-peak usage times and what happens uh

1130
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,000
with overage rates if you go over your

1131
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,940
one Peak minutes you know it came out in

1132
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,800
the in the news what three or four days

1133
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,440
ago that starlink has come back and said

1134
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,359
you know if you go over a particular cap

1135
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,760
then that will be problematic and you

1136
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,319
will have an overage however our

1137
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:28,079
off-peak time is you know 11 P.M to 7

1138
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,680
A.M uh I guess your time and so that

1139
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,540
means great if I have you know low

1140
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,460
priority data then that's when I should

1141
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,020
choose to send it

1142
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,380
so if we look at that and say if you're

1143
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,359
looking at the cost of electricity if

1144
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,099
you're looking at the cost of data rate

1145
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,319
if you're looking at things that are

1146
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,540
changing in the external environment but

1147
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,060
the overall total cost of operation of

1148
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,579
the node then that is additional

1149
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,700
predictable scheduleable information

1150
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,680
that may impact how you want to make

1151
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,060
routing decisions

1152
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,220
or just generally handle your data not

1153
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,619
all the costs are strictly financial and

1154
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,800
the benefits here may be that we choose

1155
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,859
to rank or associate cost functions with

1156
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,200
the use of links in a different way with

1157
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,020
the extra information next slide

1158
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,560
so again assumptions and benefits we

1159
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,540
would assume that if this were something

1160
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,520
that would benefit from TBR schedule

1161
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,040
like information we would say we can

1162
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,260
measure those external costs we

1163
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,760
understand our data rate usage or our

1164
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,280
energy usage uh the the changes in those

1165
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,780
costs are either predictable or

1166
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,280
scheduled or scheduled because they were

1167
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,520
predicted uh and that the cost

1168
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,240
differences persist for long enough and

1169
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,740
optimizing them has a savings that is

1170
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,660
big enough to justify the extra

1171
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,880
computation or work to figure out and

1172
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,280
make use of this additional knowledge

1173
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,319
but of course I think if you do that

1174
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,579
then you can come back with some

1175
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,440
benefits and say well wait a minute we

1176
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,800
can filter links uh that is a very this

1177
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,680
link was very low cost five minutes ago

1178
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,900
but now we're in on peak hours where

1179
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,220
we're about to go into overage and now

1180
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,319
this link might have a different higher

1181
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:09,180
cost either Financial cost or logical

1182
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,220
cost and maybe we want to think about it

1183
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,040
differently because of that

1184
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,140
we can also come back and say in certain

1185
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,359
cases maybe we want to plan and

1186
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:20,640
accumulate Data before we use a link

1187
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,160
based on its cost maybe we even want to

1188
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,079
look at the fact that if a link is high

1189
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,880
rate but we think that the good good put

1190
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,500
might be relatively low versus the

1191
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,599
throughput if anyone's ever looked at

1192
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:32,760
nodes who've spent a lot of energy

1193
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,619
trying to punch an RF signal through a

1194
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,079
storm for example maybe we wait on that

1195
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:39,599
for a variety of reasons and again all

1196
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,980
of this comes back to trying to get

1197
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,540
better data delivery and make better

1198
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,460
data delivery decisions

1199
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,520
next slide

1200
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,440
again for this one a contrived node one

1201
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,240
node two node three where we come back

1202
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,339
and say if we were to Simply on the

1203
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:56,400
vertical say cost High Low Time T1 T2 T3

1204
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,680
across the three node Network those can

1205
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,599
change over time in this case maybe it's

1206
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,040
spatially distributed nodes with the

1207
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,400
cellular backhaul and we look at how the

1208
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,680
topology does not change the links are

1209
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,480
still there but we may come back with

1210
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,400
things like well Node 1 to node two can

1211
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,200
be either low cost or high cost at

1212
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,720
different times and even perhaps in in

1213
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,760
this third case at the bottom you may

1214
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,800
wind up saying if I want it to be low

1215
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,020
from Node 1 to node 2 and low from node

1216
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,880
2 to node 3 and it's something that's

1217
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,380
reasonable in your network you may

1218
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,579
actually hold on to it for a little

1219
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,380
while waiting for that node two to node

1220
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,240
3 cost to be lower

1221
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,339
next slide

1222
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:34,740
then the last slide is sort of these

1223
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,619
mobile networks uh and obviously uh Leo

1224
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,480
satcom is is an example of that but

1225
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,220
there are others and and there are

1226
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,800
really three cases of Mobility but again

1227
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,540
under the idea of a solution for one

1228
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,180
might be a solution for many so we don't

1229
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,099
necessarily perhaps see them as three

1230
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,800
distinct use cases are cases where I

1231
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,260
have two nodes have moved far enough

1232
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,839
apart that they lose the ability to talk

1233
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:58,859
to each other

1234
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:01,200
or two nodes have not moved too far

1235
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,300
apart but they together are moving

1236
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,800
through an environment or an environment

1237
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,500
is moving through them such that they

1238
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,440
can't talk to each other or one of them

1239
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,300
has pointed their antenna somewhere else

1240
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,400
and they can no longer talk to each

1241
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,740
other all of those are Mobility based or

1242
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,160
motion based losses to a link

1243
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,960
next slide

1244
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,640
so again from an assumptions and

1245
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,099
benefits point of view if you understand

1246
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,540
the motion

1247
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,819
if you know where things are going with

1248
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:32,520
some predictability uh with Leo we tend

1249
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,839
to know where they are but we maybe

1250
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,220
don't know what's powered on or where

1251
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,460
things are pointed and or if you

1252
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,680
understand the environment which may be

1253
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,599
also impacting you

1254
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:45,180
then that is knowledge you can exploit

1255
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,760
to understand when an adjacency would go

1256
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,560
away understand when a link could come

1257
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,020
back maybe to even include that the

1258
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,420
resumption might be a different link

1259
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,579
than the one that went down which would

1260
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:57,839
be a useful thing

1261
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,819
uh that you can understand how your data

1262
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:01,680
rates would be adjusted and generally

1263
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,119
you can use all of this for better

1264
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,079
filtering of the links as well Leslie

1265
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,060
so again in our Network Leo

1266
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,560
constellation if we have a couple of

1267
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,200
spacecraft and we assume that they have

1268
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,020
a different uh ground coverage over time

1269
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,119
for example spacecraft one is over

1270
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,099
ground at time three spacecraft two at

1271
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,140
time two and so on then we can sort of

1272
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,420
understand as this train goes by over

1273
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,760
the ground station in minutes

1274
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,579
uh we need to understand handoff and we

1275
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:31,619
need to understand that certain links

1276
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,300
are going up and down and as one

1277
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,099
spacecraft leaves the ground you then

1278
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,660
need to go for example to an inner

1279
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,400
satellite link to the spacecraft behind

1280
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,079
you so that it can keep that going back

1281
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,819
down to the ground and that's something

1282
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:43,859
you do because you can predict and you

1283
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,420
have a schedule to deal with that level

1284
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,280
of dynamic topology

1285
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,460
so that's 15 minutes on some high-level

1286
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,040
categories of use cases that we think

1287
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,319
would benefit from TBR and then I think

1288
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:56,819
after this we have a couple of deep

1289
00:50:56,819 --> 00:51:00,980
dives into more specific examples

1290
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,240
okay great thank you sure uh

1291
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,940
thank you sorry I turned the mic off

1292
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,540
um Kevin is going to present uh next and

1293
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,700
he is remote

1294
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,500
Uh Kevin you don't need to share your

1295
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,960
screen we'll just pass you control

1296
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,339
so just hold on one moment

1297
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,140
Kevin can you uh say something to make

1298
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,058
sure we you we know you're here

1299
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,020
Kevin you may have to unmute your mic

1300
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,040
here we go

1301
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:57,300
Kevin wrong Kevin

1302
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,839
short

1303
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,420
but Kevin we don't hear you Dan will you

1304
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,940
no different Kevin that's fall we're

1305
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,920
looking for short or to say that

1306
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,240
backwards

1307
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,299
um

1308
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,500
it's we need audio he needs audio don't

1309
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,000
worry about the slides just get your

1310
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,980
audio working and Dan if you would come

1311
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,540
up to be prepared to present just in

1312
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,720
case

1313
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,619
short yeah

1314
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,980
Uh Kevin you need to unmute we can see

1315
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,700
that you're muted

1316
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:55,260
I think maybe Dan if he could take over

1317
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,480
and then if we get Kevin if you get your

1318
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,579
mic issue sorted you can just start

1319
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:03,440
talking and we'll let you run

1320
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,900
cool um so while while we figure out

1321
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,599
um the audio and some slides

1322
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,579
um my name's Dan

1323
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:14,400
um with Kevin at Airbus I'm at Lancaster

1324
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,700
University uh we are introducing a use

1325
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,280
case next slide please uh there's

1326
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,260
already been a couple of mentions to

1327
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,000
sort of emerging satellite Club

1328
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,040
constellations you know the space-based

1329
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,500
use case it sounds extremely futuristic

1330
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,780
but of course these Networks

1331
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,619
are being put in space there are several

1332
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:37,680
large constellations with tens hundreds

1333
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,260
thousands of nodes whizzing around the

1334
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,900
planet at the moment they are

1335
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,319
um extremely small they're increasing in

1336
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,000
size and number they have multiple link

1337
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,099
types next slide please

1338
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,859
that we can choose in order to set up

1339
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:55,619
the physical connectivity so in some of

1340
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:57,540
the constellations there are high

1341
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,780
bandwidth interfaces uh on the order of

1342
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,400
gigabits per second using free space

1343
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,460
Optics operating actually at speeds that

1344
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,619
are uh sufficiently are significantly

1345
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,540
faster than traditional sort of

1346
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,599
earth-based fiber-based systems there

1347
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:17,700
are also radio interfaces and uh uh

1348
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,400
those radio those RF interfaces are also

1349
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,520
evolving over time up to sort of

1350
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,800
gigabits and tens of gigabits per second

1351
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,660
in terms of building the the space

1352
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,260
topology we can continue through various

1353
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,500
space segments using uh interspace links

1354
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,020
isls but we also have the opportunity

1355
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,660
with some constellations to Bounce Down

1356
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,359
to the planet uh using base stations and

1357
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,760
in sort of several major countries there

1358
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,579
are often multiple base stations that

1359
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,640
can be used next slide please

1360
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,220
so what we need to kind of figure out is

1361
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,640
how we build this network topology given

1362
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,700
that there are several space-based uh

1363
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,280
segments that we can use as well as sort

1364
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,440
of dropping down back to

1365
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,660
um uh terra firma

1366
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,900
we know that these links offer different

1367
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,760
characteristics so there are bandwidths

1368
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,460
latencies uh potentially Jitter as well

1369
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,980
if you're a starlink user and and I am

1370
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,960
as well as a tester you'll notice that

1371
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,880
we have a lot of bandwidth and

1372
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,700
availability but actually uh there are

1373
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,420
cue issues and latency and

1374
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,400
unpredictability for jitta can cause a

1375
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,020
major problem for

1376
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,740
certain low latency applications next

1377
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,240
slide please

1378
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,839
so we need to figure out in advance how

1379
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,040
we're going to build our physical

1380
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,200
topology given that there are multiple

1381
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,540
links bandwidth constraints potential

1382
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,780
cue issues and also the amount of power

1383
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,579
available on some of these satellite

1384
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:53,099
nodes as well as of course the bandwidth

1385
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,900
that's going to be potentially available

1386
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,980
at a given point in time now this is a

1387
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,619
uh a network path computation problem

1388
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:04,140
that can be solved with a combination of

1389
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,359
traditional techniques we've heard

1390
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:07,920
earlier sort of some linear Solutions

1391
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,640
like dijkstra you could of course use a

1392
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,099
control center with humans sort of

1393
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:16,260
biological path computation to do some

1394
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,920
offline planning to try to optimize

1395
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,740
your network what what we're looking for

1396
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,599
next slide please

1397
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,160
is potentially a method a process of

1398
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,000
building a network topology virtually in

1399
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,700
advance that can then be overlaid

1400
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,859
so we also need to consider that this

1401
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:39,540
isn't just a planning problem but it

1402
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,960
needs to react potentially uh to

1403
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,000
changing real-time conditions but real

1404
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,780
time is relative so real time for a

1405
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,740
fixed Network might be a few seconds or

1406
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,839
tens of seconds when you start losing an

1407
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:57,300
adjacency to a particular sort of next

1408
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,500
hot neighbor in your igp but in space

1409
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,900
sort of a real-time change might be over

1410
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,260
uh several hours as you're recharging a

1411
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,480
particular node in order to sort of uh

1412
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,640
gain power and then be able to light

1413
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,099
some new interface

1414
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:17,220
uh there will also be uh connectivity

1415
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:21,000
potentially coming Online predicted uh

1416
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,760
though that is not space-based but is

1417
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,460
high altitude so there are sort of UA

1418
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,059
UAV uh unmanned aerial vehicles that

1419
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:33,180
potentially can augment uh your network

1420
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,940
next slide please

1421
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,040
so we will need to build this kind of

1422
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,280
network graph including some sort of

1423
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,400
online capability with the ability to

1424
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,920
consider offline and maybe the

1425
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,599
definition of online and offline needs

1426
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,760
to be clear here for people essentially

1427
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,200
it's some kind of

1428
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,920
um uh entity that is talking directly to

1429
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,480
the network I suppose that's what I

1430
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,460
might consider online offline would be

1431
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,260
to pull out the traffic engineering

1432
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:05,280
database run some uh evaluations uh

1433
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,099
create a candidate topology that that

1434
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:11,280
might be done in an offline uh instance

1435
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,380
and then I want to apply that at some

1436
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,020
point in the future but something has to

1437
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,900
kind of merge these two databases at

1438
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,859
some point

1439
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:23,640
uh and if we had Kevin online he he

1440
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,220
would probably talk about uh conops

1441
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,240
which is a form of sort of operational

1442
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,160
uh management that's done by a team of

1443
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,859
people augmented by heuristics or sort

1444
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:38,460
of non-heuristic technology so I suppose

1445
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,740
for some of these use cases the time

1446
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,900
Horizon is very different you know for a

1447
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,400
satellite Network we might be talking

1448
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,619
about minutes hours you know days during

1449
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:49,680
the chat someone was talking about uh

1450
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,460
deep space connectivity as well for for

1451
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,460
other use cases it might all be

1452
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,579
happening over several minutes uh or or

1453
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,059
hours and I know that you know we we get

1454
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:04,559
excited or I get excited about

1455
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,900
space-based communication but but the

1456
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,819
same Concepts and requirements also

1457
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:10,559
apply to things like rural internet

1458
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,660
where essentially you've got microwave

1459
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,240
links or indeed free space objects where

1460
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,280
you've only got these links available at

1461
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,900
particular times of day because that's

1462
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,460
when you can get enough sunlight like to

1463
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,559
power the interfaces as well but they're

1464
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,359
highly predictable because generally the

1465
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:26,160
sun will rise and set in the same

1466
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,780
location if it doesn't then we're

1467
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,740
probably in trouble next slide please

1468
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,440
uh and the

1469
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,260
Network

1470
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:39,180
Discovery building the topology

1471
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,400
analyzing the topology making the

1472
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,859
predictions uh building some future

1473
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:45,839
candidate technology and I mentioned in

1474
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,299
the chat that this this feels like or

1475
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:50,579
sounds like potentially a scheduled or

1476
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:53,280
excuse me scheduled virtual Network

1477
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,780
topology uh needs to apply to a variety

1478
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,900
of service types your users that are

1479
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,119
actually attaching to the network

1480
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,160
and those you know those are listed

1481
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,400
there for sort of space-based marine uh

1482
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,160
high altitude uh unmanned aircraft next

1483
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,680
slide please

1484
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,440
so what would we like from TBR and of

1485
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,119
course this is sort of walking into a

1486
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,040
toy shop and saying well Dan you know

1487
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,359
choose anything that you want I'm going

1488
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,940
to try and grab everything I can knowing

1489
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:28,200
that there is a kind of reality

1490
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,480
um question that we need to apply here

1491
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,540
and

1492
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,099
wanting to kind of minimize potentially

1493
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:37,680
the amount of state that gets created

1494
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,660
and potentially injected in a in a

1495
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,040
routing protocol that's going to be used

1496
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,500
in an online function so bear with me

1497
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,599
we've just kind of Kevin and I have put

1498
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,579
everything potentially that we would

1499
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:50,819
like here but there has to be a method

1500
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:53,700
of exporting or retrieving information

1501
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,000
from the network discovering capability

1502
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,400
understanding what metrics we will need

1503
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,900
to consider and it's all of the standard

1504
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,640
uh sort of routing metrics that we might

1505
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,119
want in terms of latency bandwidth Etc

1506
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:11,880
uh costs but cost might also have a

1507
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,799
physical element to it in this case so

1508
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,299
there'll be a network cost and maybe a

1509
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:18,240
fiscal cost of powering a unit versus

1510
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,579
choosing a particular link

1511
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:24,480
uh we will need to consider the sort of

1512
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,000
the

1513
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,380
resiliency here as well there's a

1514
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:32,299
restoration uh consideration uh not only

1515
01:01:32,299 --> 01:01:34,740
does the generation of a virtual Network

1516
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,740
topology or some candidate

1517
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:40,140
future topology need to be considered

1518
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:45,000
but it needs to potentially uh uh react

1519
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,619
to changing Network conditions in the

1520
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,880
event of some kind of catastrophic

1521
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,099
failure such as

1522
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:52,260
um uh the removal of a node or

1523
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,420
degradation of a link we may need to

1524
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,500
switch over

1525
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,720
uh and that that could be I think

1526
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,180
someone mentioned earlier uh occlusion

1527
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,940
you know which which may be weather or

1528
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,280
or or some other sort of debris that's

1529
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,180
getting in the way uh okay

1530
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,859
so I'm just looking at the time here as

1531
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:13,260
well so maybe our stock because there

1532
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,819
are going to be commonalities with some

1533
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:16,200
of these requirements across the other

1534
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,599
use cases are we taking questions now

1535
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:21,119
are we saving them for after the I would

1536
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,339
prefer to save them but if you have a

1537
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,859
clarifying question please come on up

1538
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:28,260
or come to the queue

1539
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,540
and Eve if you get ready for the next

1540
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,099
one

1541
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:34,440
thank you I I think we're going to have

1542
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,500
some good discussion on the

1543
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,780
um gaps and mechanisms so I want to make

1544
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:43,160
sure to reserve some time for that

1545
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,099
all right Eve okay can you hear me

1546
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:49,380
yes you sound good thank you perfect

1547
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,619
okay so I will extend this conversation

1548
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:55,319
by talking about something we've begun

1549
01:02:55,319 --> 01:02:58,020
to call carbon aware networking uh which

1550
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,440
we believe uh solidly Falls within this

1551
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,299
discussion around time variant routing

1552
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:06,180
as an example of an environmental impact

1553
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,180
use case and I will tie it to

1554
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,339
um one of the use case categories that

1555
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:13,859
Ed so clearly talked about

1556
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:16,700
next slide

1557
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:27,240
you have control Eve oh I have control

1558
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:31,399
I do I don't think I do

1559
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:35,099
oh I see okay

1560
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:37,079
here we go

1561
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,119
I do have control all right so the

1562
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,500
backdrop here

1563
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,200
um is that uh for anyone who's been

1564
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,660
following the UN intergovernmental panel

1565
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,520
on climate change

1566
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,819
um there's pretty dire urgency to

1567
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:54,059
uh try to meet these thresholds that are

1568
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:55,980
out there after which you know we really

1569
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,859
can't even model what the consequences

1570
01:03:58,859 --> 01:04:01,140
are going to be and uh in the most

1571
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:04,020
recent reports uh those recommendations

1572
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,599
and reports have been called you know

1573
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:09,059
code red moments you know we're really

1574
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:11,640
at a Tipping Point and so what can all

1575
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,099
of us be doing to

1576
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:18,180
um uh be more considerate uh about uh

1577
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,760
climate change and greenhouse gas

1578
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,040
emissions and if you look at the

1579
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,020
information communication Technologies

1580
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,020
contribution to those emissions uh it's

1581
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:31,799
fairly sizable and growing and some

1582
01:04:31,799 --> 01:04:33,180
estimates are that at least the

1583
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:37,140
electricity usage by ICT is between will

1584
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,059
be between two and it's about two

1585
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:41,160
percent now but by 2030 will be about

1586
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,079
six percent of all Global electricity

1587
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,680
which in turn has a carbon footprint

1588
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,119
although data centers get all of the

1589
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:50,000
attention in terms of their footprint

1590
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,280
the network impact Rivals that of the

1591
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,980
data center and in some estimates from

1592
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:00,059
the itu which typically makes these

1593
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:01,680
reports and Publications on a regular

1594
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,559
basis the network is at least as large

1595
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,859
and as uh sometimes as large as one and

1596
01:05:07,859 --> 01:05:09,420
a half times the size of the data center

1597
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,220
in terms of its footprint carbon

1598
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,660
footprint

1599
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,480
um there's also the recognition that

1600
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,799
there is

1601
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,280
um an increasing tidal wave of data that

1602
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,960
gets generated by all the things that

1603
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,780
are connected to the network and it's

1604
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,760
almost as though the only way we could

1605
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,579
get to a situation where we have carbon

1606
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:34,020
neutrality or Net Zero impact is to not

1607
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:37,319
just consider Energy Efficiency of our

1608
01:05:37,319 --> 01:05:40,319
products and components but to really

1609
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:43,260
think about the coupling of Renewables

1610
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,740
with all of our infrastructure

1611
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:49,559
uh and additionally when you think about

1612
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:51,839
what is so disruptive about this is that

1613
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,280
if we're going to be moving to clean

1614
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,920
energy to address the issues of

1615
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,740
greenhouse gases I'm hearing an echo I

1616
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,440
don't know if others are hearing an echo

1617
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,160
we're not sorry oh okay

1618
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:05,880
um

1619
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,160
that uh to move to the electrification

1620
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,140
of Transportation hopefully clean

1621
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,599
electrification and transportation we're

1622
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:14,099
going to need about four times the

1623
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:15,599
amount of electricity that's currently

1624
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,839
being generated and some estimates are

1625
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:20,940
that that's going to entail about 20

1626
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,619
times as much infrastructure that's

1627
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:25,500
already out there so we're at this very

1628
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,859
interesting uh moment we know that

1629
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,599
there's going to be a long Arc of

1630
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:33,359
rollout of this infrastructure and so in

1631
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,960
that time and and we may never get to a

1632
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,299
fully

1633
01:06:38,299 --> 01:06:41,420
renewable or clean energy

1634
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:43,859
oriented grid

1635
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:46,200
um and and even if we could there was

1636
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,460
going to be this long Arc of

1637
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,680
infrastructure rollout and even longer

1638
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,920
amounts of time than uh how long it

1639
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,220
takes to roll out Telecom or Internet

1640
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:00,240
infrastructure and in that time we want

1641
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,579
to be thinking about well how can we

1642
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:06,660
steer our usage of electricity to be uh

1643
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,420
the least impactful

1644
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,579
um and there is this metric that is

1645
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:14,099
quite interesting which is uh carbon

1646
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:16,559
intensity which is a measure effectively

1647
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,319
of how green is the electricity and

1648
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:21,480
we've been talking uh Rick and I and

1649
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,880
other colleagues at Yale University in

1650
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,500
Oxford

1651
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,680
um about the what-ifs behind could we

1652
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,960
add to the performance metrics of

1653
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,440
networks which are typically uh

1654
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,500
described in terms of their packet loss

1655
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,599
their latency and their Jitter what

1656
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,359
about if we could describe the

1657
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:43,619
performance of the network in terms of

1658
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:46,920
not just its energy usage but also the

1659
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,200
greenness of that energy and carbon

1660
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,619
intensity is better when it is lower

1661
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:54,299
um and so if you were to think about

1662
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:56,819
sort of sustainable networks you'd want

1663
01:07:56,819 --> 01:07:58,559
to be thinking about

1664
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,359
how do you design them so that they

1665
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:02,339
consume less energy how do you

1666
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:04,680
decarbonize the electricity that they do

1667
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,780
consume and then there are other kinds

1668
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,220
of actual environmental impacts which

1669
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,500
we're not going to get into today

1670
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,420
um that are other concerns

1671
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:16,380
um that are things like around water and

1672
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,319
waste and uh chemistry and things like

1673
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:20,759
that

1674
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:24,899
um now we're inspired here because uh

1675
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:28,380
many of the hyperscalers are adopting

1676
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,238
techniques called that they are

1677
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,279
referring to as carbon aware or carbon

1678
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:34,799
intelligent Computing where they are

1679
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,080
physically

1680
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,420
time and space shifting their workloads

1681
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:42,120
so that we place them in places where

1682
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,540
there is the least carbon intensity and

1683
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,660
the attempt here is as stated earlier is

1684
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,839
to maximize the usage of Renewables like

1685
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,120
solar and wind alongside of other things

1686
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,580
that are considered clean energy when we

1687
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,920
look at them from a greenhouse gas

1688
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,979
emission or carbon standpoint there's

1689
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:03,779
also another interesting phenomenon

1690
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:05,580
happening that

1691
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:08,640
um if you look at places like California

1692
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,880
and Germany parts of the globe where

1693
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,600
Renewables are being integrated at uh

1694
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,500
um accelerated pace and consume or at

1695
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,198
least deliver over a high percentage of

1696
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:23,719
the electricity in the grid

1697
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:26,880
unfortunately there's a mismatch between

1698
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,979
the supply and the demand for that

1699
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:31,020
electricity and so sometimes there's

1700
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:35,100
excess Renewables being generated

1701
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,880
um and that go wasted as a consequence

1702
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:42,960
uh and so what the data center community

1703
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,560
has begun to do is to use the data

1704
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,960
centers themselves as a virtual battery

1705
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,839
of sorts so that in moments where there

1706
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,140
is an excess of Renewables

1707
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:58,320
that time elastic workloads are sort of

1708
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,199
on the ready to absorb that excess

1709
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,440
energy

1710
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,699
um

1711
01:10:07,699 --> 01:10:10,320
so naturally the question is well how

1712
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,060
does this relate back to what we could

1713
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,340
be doing with networking and we do

1714
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,080
believe that there are carbon aware

1715
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,340
techniques

1716
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:20,040
um that we should consider adopting

1717
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,780
um and that when we started to look at

1718
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:24,360
this problem we naturally thought oh

1719
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,000
well clearly we want to take routes and

1720
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,820
we want to Route our data Transmissions

1721
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,040
through parts of the network where

1722
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,480
there's the greatest carbon efficiency

1723
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,340
so where the carbon intensity would be

1724
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:39,960
lowest uh but there's also dtn like

1725
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,600
uh time shifting that we could also

1726
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,460
leverage here

1727
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,920
um several of us who are part of this

1728
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,600
conversation also come out of the

1729
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,239
deterministic networking community and

1730
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:53,640
uh there is the

1731
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,940
um ambition that uh for this kind of

1732
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,159
traffic engineering we'd like to also be

1733
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:01,800
able to guarantee that we stay below

1734
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,140
certain thresholds along Pathways in the

1735
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,199
networks and even go so far as to Ponder

1736
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,540
could we be reserving resources whether

1737
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,820
those are battery related resources or

1738
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:14,640
predicted availability of Renewables

1739
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,159
along those paths in the same way that

1740
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:19,860
for example uh in the detnet community

1741
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,440
we talk about uh or at least in the

1742
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,420
time-sensitive networking Community we

1743
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,400
talk about

1744
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:29,100
reserving buffers along Pathways in

1745
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,739
order that our our packets don't uh

1746
01:11:31,739 --> 01:11:33,600
confront to any kind of congestion along

1747
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,520
those paths so that's the equivalence

1748
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,460
there and then finally in order to do

1749
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,620
some of this we really do need Telemetry

1750
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:43,260
and how do we make that Telemetry itself

1751
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:47,300
as a workload be carbon aware

1752
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:56,820
so I uh I was inspired by Ed slides and

1753
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:01,080
so I um you know I I kind of I took his

1754
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,540
example of you know sort of providing

1755
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,000
this overview of you know I believe that

1756
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,920
the carbon aware networking Falls

1757
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,560
squarely in the operating efficiency use

1758
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,060
case

1759
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,159
um and that we could comprehend carbon

1760
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,199
intensity as part of a cost function for

1761
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,159
links

1762
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:20,880
uh this the the reality that we have

1763
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,719
batteries uh in many situations uh not

1764
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,340
just virtual batteries but actual

1765
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,920
batteries also means that there's shades

1766
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,659
of use case one about resource

1767
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:32,040
preservation that we could leverage

1768
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,159
because it may be the case that

1769
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:36,600
um you might want to opt for battery

1770
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,140
operation when the battery has a mix of

1771
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,120
electricity whose carbon intensity is

1772
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,040
less than the carbon intensity coming

1773
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,219
out of the wall socket and something I

1774
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:48,659
won't really get into because I really

1775
01:12:48,659 --> 01:12:50,699
haven't thought about it really deeply

1776
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:53,219
enough but there is this cons this

1777
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:55,320
possible shade of use case three about

1778
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,380
mobile devices that we can dispatch

1779
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,360
mobile distributed energy resources

1780
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:03,360
whether those are energy generation or

1781
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,100
storage in the places where they're

1782
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,159
needed and this is something commonly uh

1783
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,080
that commonly occurs in the event of

1784
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,199
emergencies for example but um how it

1785
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,199
relates back to TDR is

1786
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:19,100
um we recognize that

1787
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,659
there are causes for the loss or

1788
01:13:21,659 --> 01:13:23,580
reappearance of adjacent lengths that

1789
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,620
are related to external environmental

1790
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,900
factors such as the sun is shining or

1791
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,420
the wind is blowing or these thresholds

1792
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,860
that we've talked about either those

1793
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,719
have been exceeded or were staying

1794
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:36,120
beneath them for carbon intensity and

1795
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,219
clearly there are benefits because the

1796
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:40,260
expected loss of links are not seen as

1797
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,540
errors but as optimizations and that the

1798
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,060
resumption of these links is not about

1799
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,400
the ReDiscover rediscovery from scratch

1800
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,140
but they are waiting

1801
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:52,159
um on standby

1802
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:56,280
this is of course I went back to Ed's

1803
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,159
slide unfortunately a slightly earlier

1804
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:02,040
version of head slide uh but but the

1805
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,940
point is that um uh

1806
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,820
it is really to ask the question whether

1807
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:11,100
this use case meets these assumptions

1808
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,640
and I think to a large degree it does uh

1809
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,320
we believe that there's measurability

1810
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,120
that there's predictability in

1811
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,860
scheduling

1812
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,739
um when these cost changes occur and we

1813
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:25,440
can communicate that in advance

1814
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,120
um

1815
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:29,940
and uh that you know here's something to

1816
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:33,540
to consider is uh how often are these

1817
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:36,480
changes to the topology that is in part

1818
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,000
a function of how often something like

1819
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,719
carbon intensity is shared uh by the

1820
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,340
utilities

1821
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:46,560
um and uh what we can come back to that

1822
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,060
in a moment

1823
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,340
um but there's also the question about

1824
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:54,420
is the cost of the savings uh does it

1825
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,460
justify the effort or the work that

1826
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,400
we're going to do to enable this

1827
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,580
um one data point is that uh in the

1828
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,640
recent California temperature

1829
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,699
um uh during the summer in California

1830
01:15:08,699 --> 01:15:11,580
that we had a Spate of temperature and

1831
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,280
weather that the utilities you know

1832
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,800
reached out to the to the populace and

1833
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,540
said could you please not use your

1834
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,699
electricity and someone turned around

1835
01:15:20,699 --> 01:15:23,340
and you know did a Model uh given the

1836
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,380
amount of electric vehicles that we have

1837
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,540
and the battery of availability could we

1838
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:31,460
avert blackouts and the cost of that to

1839
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,800
in the you know to the economy and so

1840
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,420
something like that might be a way to

1841
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:38,580
quantify is what we're doing

1842
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:41,040
um beneficial enough uh I think it's

1843
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,480
hard to to uh specify completely what's

1844
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,760
enough but we can also come back to that

1845
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,960
but

1846
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:53,100
um the in terms of the possible benefits

1847
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,080
um I think that it also matches up quite

1848
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,300
nicely I didn't I don't believe that it

1849
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,219
uh has this property about first

1850
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:00,540
planning

1851
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:03,000
um one interesting facet in terms of the

1852
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,520
environmental measures is we are going

1853
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,739
to face some regulatory pressure so

1854
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:09,540
again there's going to be some carbon

1855
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,440
taxes and so some of this may be around

1856
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,340
um

1857
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,500
are there

1858
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,020
um are there actual costs Financial

1859
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:21,840
costs that are can be associated with

1860
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,060
this problem that also were part of the

1861
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,100
link state

1862
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,480
not just Environmental

1863
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:33,960
um as I uh intimated uh carbon intensity

1864
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,880
is not something that Network operators

1865
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,880
own it's really the utilities own this

1866
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,739
and uh there are issues about how

1867
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:44,880
granular uh the areas or regions are

1868
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,520
within which carbon intensity is derived

1869
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,520
and actually exported and shared the

1870
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,739
frequency with which it's updated and

1871
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:55,100
what parts of the world it is actually

1872
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:59,699
being openly communicated to uh Beyond

1873
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:01,860
just the utilities

1874
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:04,140
um there's this subtle interplay between

1875
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:06,480
the batteries and the electricity

1876
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,280
generation that we'll have to deal with

1877
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,800
an SI intermitted the justification of

1878
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,480
function is something that needs deeper

1879
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,560
analysis

1880
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,159
I think that is it

1881
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:18,960
um there are a few other resources if

1882
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,699
you'd like to read more about sort of

1883
01:17:20,699 --> 01:17:22,080
the whole state of carbon responsive

1884
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,239
Computing and uh towards carbon aware

1885
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,980
networking

1886
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:30,600
and um I think we are now uh we can open

1887
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,920
up the mic

1888
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,060
for all three presentations

1889
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:41,880
yes we have about uh seven minutes or so

1890
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,860
for discussion on this topic we're going

1891
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,620
to reserve time uh for discussion we

1892
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,820
can't hear you I think you had turned

1893
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:50,940
off the mic because of the echo

1894
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:53,120
foreign

1895
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:02,340
can you hear me yes I can't I can't but

1896
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:05,300
you're very quiet

1897
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,679
thank you very much I think I think this

1898
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:12,860
working group is uh

1899
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:17,159
interesting and I'm willing to uh

1900
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:21,800
to help in working in this group

1901
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:27,480
but I still see that the the solution or

1902
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:31,980
the proposed solution is not clear I uh

1903
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,620
from the beginning or the first

1904
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:38,940
presentation it considers only or saying

1905
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:42,179
that that it's varying the metrics or

1906
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:45,360
changing the metrics for the a routing

1907
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,340
protocol

1908
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:50,940
uh it's not much clear I think maybe I

1909
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:54,480
can propose that either we say that

1910
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,400
changing or or a scheduling change of

1911
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,940
some kind of algorithm is it are we

1912
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,920
changing the algorithm or only the

1913
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,320
metrics at least we be clear on that

1914
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:11,940
also because and also we need to clear

1915
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,000
on the conditions or that we can say

1916
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,159
initial conditions for this kind of

1917
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:21,540
variation uh to to and also we should

1918
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:27,199
consider the stability of the routing

1919
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:30,440
routing mechanism

1920
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:33,780
so that's my comment and thank you very

1921
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:35,159
much

1922
01:19:35,159 --> 01:19:37,980
uh things I think that in the long term

1923
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:39,900
what we'd like to do here is to Define

1924
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,760
models and stuff of course it's up for

1925
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,980
the work group to decide what the actual

1926
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,900
scope is but to figure out what the

1927
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,360
models are and what needs to be done and

1928
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,600
kind of push it back to the routing area

1929
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,040
routing the specific routing protocols

1930
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,960
to figure out how to represent those

1931
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:55,860
things

1932
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:59,219
and how to deal with them although there

1933
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:01,080
may be offline components as Tony has

1934
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,140
said in the chat and other things that

1935
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:05,640
we need to deal with

1936
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,460
but I I think that you know we're trying

1937
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,900
to just get to the point where we have a

1938
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,120
good solid set of use cases before we

1939
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,340
deal with Solutions so

1940
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,380
uh danbogganovich so this topic is

1941
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:23,280
starting to show up in the ITF for the

1942
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,020
last few meetings now

1943
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,140
and uh it's a

1944
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:31,580
big multi-dimensional problem

1945
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:34,380
I'm not sure that the ITF as a community

1946
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:37,860
is the best community to deal with uh

1947
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,420
all those because we don't have the

1948
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:41,580
expertise in some of those dimensions

1949
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:45,600
but maybe putting that into the irtf I

1950
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,480
think it would be a much much more

1951
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:51,239
uh much better place to deal with that

1952
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:55,020
until the problem has been defined at

1953
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,640
the technical level what we could go

1954
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,040
down and solve

1955
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,580
being like much more specific

1956
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,940
Miss luberger speaking as contributor I

1957
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,000
I completely agree there's there's a a

1958
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,800
lot of issues here and one of the

1959
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,020
challenges for the routing area is going

1960
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:14,460
to be what does a routing area do I

1961
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,620
think another and there was a side

1962
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,940
meeting from the transport area

1963
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,040
yesterday is from the transporter area

1964
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,719
they're going to have a question of what

1965
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:23,340
do they do you know so it may not just

1966
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,440
be one working group but it may be

1967
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,239
multiple because as you said it's a

1968
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:28,679
really big problem it's a really big

1969
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:31,080
problem you have to define the policy

1970
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,360
and how to enforce that policy over the

1971
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,199
network

1972
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:36,060
but what is the policy that you want to

1973
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,840
enforce on the network

1974
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:43,320
Dan

1975
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,880
uh Daniel King so with the greatest

1976
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,980
respect I have to disagree with Dean it

1977
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,260
wasn't actually my intention for coming

1978
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,420
up here but I don't see this as an iotf

1979
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,000
problem I see this as a an engineering

1980
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,880
problem and I see this being applied to

1981
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,980
existing infrastructure that's out being

1982
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,560
used commercially so that that's just my

1983
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,800
thoughts there the the point for coming

1984
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,199
to the mic was um thank you Eve for your

1985
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,120
presentation I see

1986
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,040
um some sort of commonality in terms of

1987
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:15,540
requirements for the area the use cases

1988
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:18,120
um that you mentioned there we we've got

1989
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,820
a internet draft it's actually in the I

1990
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,800
think the routing area

1991
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,400
so I wonder if we can work offline to

1992
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,520
kind of sync um some of our requirements

1993
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,440
and figure out the best way to kind of

1994
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,000
publish that I suppose some of that may

1995
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,159
be dependent on the conclusions that we

1996
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,140
reach at the end of the session today as

1997
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,980
well thank you

1998
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,140
Mallory

1999
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,500
okay

2000
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,440
hi Mallory noodle Center for democracy

2001
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,120
and Technology I just wanted to support

2002
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,860
this work

2003
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:54,300
um and thank you Eve for your

2004
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,980
presentation

2005
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:59,400
um I do I'm also agreeing with others in

2006
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,560
saying that I think the these topics

2007
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,199
have to be mainstreamed and a lot of the

2008
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:06,120
ietf and we shouldn't imagine that they

2009
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,699
should only happen in one place so that

2010
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:10,199
this work is happening here makes a lot

2011
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:12,420
of sense I did want to also point out

2012
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:15,239
that in the irtf we have had we at least

2013
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:17,940
had one and recent presentation although

2014
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:20,760
we've had some in the past from barath

2015
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,900
ragaven who came to talk about the ways

2016
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,060
to reduce the footprint so I think some

2017
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,920
of the metrics that are given around to

2018
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,420
you know how much electricity is needed

2019
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,920
and so on I mean it doesn't really

2020
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,679
address the fact that sometimes the

2021
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:36,960
source of that electricity is also

2022
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,280
potentially

2023
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,159
um a problem and so accounting for that

2024
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:42,780
I think there just needs to be a general

2025
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:47,159
approach to reduction and minimization

2026
01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:48,420
um because that's probably the best

2027
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:51,300
direction of travel so but thanks again

2028
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,699
thank you Lars

2029
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:56,460
hi uh Lars Eckert so um since we're

2030
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,860
going down the scoping discussion rule I

2031
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:01,620
I want to suggest to a a principle that

2032
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,840
we might use to scope Auto narrow the

2033
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,520
scope and and maybe see if that sort of

2034
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,360
has some agreement or not so I heard the

2035
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,640
Monet use case being brought up so in my

2036
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,260
mind right so the internet we run

2037
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:14,699
routing and then we run transport on top

2038
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:16,860
and transport basically operates on rdt

2039
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:18,179
time scales

2040
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:20,760
and if routing also starts to operate on

2041
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,500
rtt time scales we actually don't really

2042
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,060
have a transport thing

2043
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,040
that we know of that will operate on top

2044
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,239
of that so I wonder if we could limit

2045
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:28,500
this

2046
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,679
proposed work to the space where changes

2047
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,840
to the topology happen on you know time

2048
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,179
scales that are

2049
01:24:36,179 --> 01:24:37,679
a factor

2050
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:40,860
X for some number of the you know 90

2051
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:43,080
percentile rtt or something like that so

2052
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,219
it's you know there's a certain

2053
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:45,960
expectation that the topology isn't

2054
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,179
crazily changing all the time right it's

2055
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:50,219
it's generally stable and maybe you can

2056
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:52,380
predict when a change will happen and

2057
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,420
so you can when you have a path you can

2058
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:56,640
run a TCP style transport over it I

2059
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,860
think that might sort of get us in a box

2060
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,960
where we might know what to do about for

2061
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,880
standardization thank you yeah that's a

2062
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,679
helpful comment uh Joel Halpern made a

2063
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:08,159
similar comment in the uh chat that you

2064
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,199
know are we talking minutes microseconds

2065
01:25:10,199 --> 01:25:12,179
nanoseconds and you know the general

2066
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:13,920
discussion there is as we're talking

2067
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,300
longer periods and scheduled uh

2068
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:19,320
scheduled items that are maybe minutes

2069
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,620
hours longer depending on where you are

2070
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,659
um so that's a helpful comment with that

2071
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:27,179
we're going to move on to uh Rick

2072
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:29,580
he's actually going to be the last sort

2073
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:32,580
of formal presentation and we've

2074
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,739
reserved an extra 10 minutes we had more

2075
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:36,000
when we started but we were served after

2076
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
10 minutes of discussion and um it's

2077
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,699
probably best just to integrate it into

2078
01:25:40,699 --> 01:25:44,280
uh his talk into the later slides uh

2079
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,320
Rick over to you

2080
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,480
thanks Lou for saying formal I I rarely

2081
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,300
do anything particularly formal so um

2082
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,239
yeah this is almost a continuation of of

2083
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:57,120
where I started and and I hope addresses

2084
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,400
last Point directly and I I think I'll

2085
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,840
try and make comment to Dean as well

2086
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,760
well what we go through so down while we

2087
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,500
go through this uh next slide please

2088
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:09,420
so I started this this kind of goes back

2089
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:11,219
to to where I started with my thinking

2090
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:13,139
of my discussions were there and various

2091
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:15,719
others about this too

2092
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:17,760
I believe there's a kind of a spectrum

2093
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,760
of of routing environments which goes

2094
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:24,060
from the very fixed never change doesn't

2095
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,820
actually exist environments where we're

2096
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:28,800
talking about

2097
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,040
um ISP backbones cloud service providers

2098
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,900
that kind of stuff it's big it's stable

2099
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:37,139
it's manageable it's expected when you

2100
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:39,060
put a link in somebody's actually laid

2101
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,679
down something physical and plugged it

2102
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:42,300
into something else physical you expect

2103
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,760
it to still be there and at the other

2104
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,280
end of the spectrum you've got

2105
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,739
swarms of uavs buzzing around in an

2106
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:51,480
uncontrolled environment in the middle

2107
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:54,060
of a thunderstorm in a war zone you know

2108
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:56,760
that that world's worst ad hoc

2109
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,800
everything is in complete chaos

2110
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,500
contested environment

2111
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,080
but those aren't just two use cases that

2112
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,060
I believe there's a spectrum

2113
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,100
and I just want to kind of look at the

2114
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,080
two extremes of that

2115
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,060
and introduce the idea that I think

2116
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,400
there's a there's a either a second

2117
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,139
dimension to this or there's there's

2118
01:27:16,139 --> 01:27:19,679
another environment where I think TVR

2119
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:23,580
lives so next slide please so really

2120
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,139
if we look at the fixed environments

2121
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:26,520
there's some general assumptions which

2122
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,500
is nodes don't move around if you put

2123
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,820
something somewhere it's going to stay

2124
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,920
there things have a well-known

2125
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,560
connectivity to their peers

2126
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,900
um yeah the links to the peers May Fail

2127
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:39,600
but appear on the other end of that link

2128
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,360
is going to be the same pair it was when

2129
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,040
you started because that's how you

2130
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,900
configured it or your auto configuration

2131
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:48,120
system kind of found it and found it was

2132
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,139
there

2133
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:50,699
um

2134
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:53,360
and Link service is maintained by

2135
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,219
reactive re-routing and the key point is

2136
01:27:56,219 --> 01:27:58,380
it's it's rerouting so something fails

2137
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,659
we'll go around the problem and we will

2138
01:28:00,659 --> 01:28:02,580
maintain those end-to-end paths but we

2139
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,620
will react to that failure and this ties

2140
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:05,760
back to what I was saying at the

2141
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,100
beginning and

2142
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,199
the fourth point is links are expected

2143
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:11,639
to come back

2144
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:13,500
so there's active monitoring to say is

2145
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,199
it back yet is it back yet or and yes

2146
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:17,400
there are more Advanced Techniques

2147
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,080
around that but fundamentally when your

2148
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,900
link fails in these fixed environments

2149
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,120
the expectation is it should be there so

2150
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,679
let's let's try and work out when it

2151
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,020
comes back so that we can reactively

2152
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:31,080
reroute to it when we spot it come back

2153
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:33,840
nice and promptly and and get back to

2154
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,940
that stable thing that the sysadmin

2155
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,500
wanted to happen

2156
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,960
and it's it's kind of the mindset that

2157
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,760
has influenced the design of those

2158
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,460
protocols and you could say it goes back

2159
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:47,159
to the early days of of arpanet and

2160
01:28:47,159 --> 01:28:49,020
academic networks where people built it

2161
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,300
in a lab and you knew box one two and

2162
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,100
three because you put them there and

2163
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,659
plugged them in it was kind of that

2164
01:28:54,659 --> 01:28:57,420
mindset behind it and yeah we have a

2165
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:00,179
much more mature Ops derived view of

2166
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:02,159
these things and say yeah things do fail

2167
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:04,020
things do get swapped out through things

2168
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,659
do get upgraded but that General

2169
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:10,440
assumption about stability permeates the

2170
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,719
thinking of of the routing protocols in

2171
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:14,639
that area and without

2172
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,219
I'm not trying to to say any of these

2173
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:18,719
things about I think they're fantastic

2174
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:21,179
by their their persistence and Longevity

2175
01:29:21,179 --> 01:29:23,580
you know we're talking bgp and rspf and

2176
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,219
Isis and and even I'll point the finger

2177
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:28,620
at BFD here to say it's a great

2178
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:31,980
technique for getting prompt recovery

2179
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:34,920
but you are reacting to a failure and

2180
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,080
trying to recover quickly and BFD helps

2181
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,340
you do that

2182
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,860
so the key issues and I kind of touched

2183
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:43,440
on this earlier but I'll repeat

2184
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,480
is that when you're reactively

2185
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,699
re-routing

2186
01:29:47,699 --> 01:29:50,820
you will always have loss

2187
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:52,980
even when you knew it was about to

2188
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:54,960
happen because you are reacting to

2189
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,420
something happening and going oh

2190
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,699
God it's gone right oh we'll go this way

2191
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:02,580
it's fine or luckily I you know there is

2192
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,500
still that loss while you switch they're

2193
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,600
an opportunity to do something seamless

2194
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:10,260
because you knew it was coming is missed

2195
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:11,699
and the other side of it is that

2196
01:30:11,699 --> 01:30:14,159
proactive monitoring piece

2197
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,679
if you know it's not there and it's not

2198
01:30:16,679 --> 01:30:19,260
going to be there until tomorrow why are

2199
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,060
you monitoring to see if it comes back

2200
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:22,080
yet

2201
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,480
it's just it's just a bit wasteful and

2202
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,980
using going back to some of the use

2203
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:29,280
cases that the aired and and Eve and and

2204
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,920
uh Kevin it is Kevin isn't it yeah uh

2205
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,860
the Kevin presenter and Daniel presented

2206
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,900
um some of those environmental resources

2207
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,880
are really important

2208
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,560
some of those environments the fact that

2209
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,679
we're even burning these resources is is

2210
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:44,880
important in a larger sort of global

2211
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,880
scale and I'm a computer scientist I

2212
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,800
don't like wasting compute you know why

2213
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,239
have I got an inefficient algorithm

2214
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:52,920
doing something let's just be purist

2215
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,840
about this so there's lots of lots of

2216
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,320
reasons from different aspects about

2217
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:00,659
wasting resources is is not a good thing

2218
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:02,100
let's go to the other end of the

2219
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,840
spectrum so next slide let's look at man

2220
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,199
a and this kind of comes back to lars's

2221
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:10,380
point where there are environments where

2222
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:12,600
everything is wild

2223
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,300
so nodes move randomly within the

2224
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,040
topology because they may be physically

2225
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,960
moving they may be doing crazy things at

2226
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,820
the link there which causes all sorts of

2227
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:22,139
stuff to go on

2228
01:31:22,139 --> 01:31:23,639
links are

2229
01:31:23,639 --> 01:31:25,440
frequently break that's a general

2230
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,600
assumption in in the world of mobile ad

2231
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,060
hoc networking your links they're not

2232
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:32,040
going to be stable they are pretty much

2233
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,719
uh you know as I say links are

2234
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:36,480
considered ephemeral effectively

2235
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,840
so your network save service just like

2236
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,780
the fixed environments it's maintained

2237
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:45,060
by reactive rerouting I found a new

2238
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:46,800
opportunity I've lost an opportunity

2239
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,860
I'll quickly rebuild my topology I may

2240
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:53,159
do it in very exciting and funky ways

2241
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:57,060
because many tackles this environment

2242
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:58,679
um that may be considerably less

2243
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:00,300
efficient than link state routing but it

2244
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,159
will work in environments where link

2245
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:04,260
State just doesn't

2246
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:06,360
um but it's still fundamentally reactive

2247
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,600
rerouting you are reacting to some break

2248
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,639
in your current assumption about your

2249
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:13,320
end-to-end path and you are therefore

2250
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:14,820
desperately trying to work out some

2251
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:16,920
alternate way to re-establish it

2252
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,020
and links as I said are considered

2253
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,600
ephemeral and therefore adjacencies are

2254
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,340
proactively discovered so you'll see if

2255
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:26,280
you do sort of read through most of the

2256
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,760
many protocols instead of

2257
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,920
understanding that the peer on the other

2258
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,260
end of that link is expected to be there

2259
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:35,580
and let's try and keep that

2260
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:38,219
establishment going BFD style or or you

2261
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:39,840
know however you want to do it your TCP

2262
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,460
keeper lives Etc

2263
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:42,900
um you'll see a lot of the man a

2264
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,420
protocols will do things like uh active

2265
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:47,340
discovery of oh there's other new peers

2266
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:48,900
are the peers I was expecting still

2267
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:51,120
there have any peers disappeared since I

2268
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,739
lasted there's a lot of helloing a lot

2269
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:54,719
of two hot neighbor Discovery it's a

2270
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,820
very interesting things

2271
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:59,159
but it's active

2272
01:32:59,159 --> 01:33:02,940
there's no idea of stop looking your

2273
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:06,060
radio is silent between now and

2274
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,560
Wednesday

2275
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,460
um

2276
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:10,860
and therefore you have the same problems

2277
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:13,380
which is the reactive rerouting

2278
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,940
and this is more important to many

2279
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:16,739
environments where you probably are

2280
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:20,000
talking constraining devices

2281
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:22,020
you've got that little loss because

2282
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:24,600
you've lost that link quick rethink oh

2283
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,760
oh it's that way there's a loss there

2284
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,980
and to go back to the point of you could

2285
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:30,780
accidentally form micro Loops because

2286
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:32,400
several things could spot that link

2287
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,560
fading at the same time which means that

2288
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,440
initial stab at oh it'll go this way

2289
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,060
could well be wrong and then you get

2290
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:40,739
corrective and loop avoidance and loop

2291
01:33:40,739 --> 01:33:42,540
back off kind of algorithms which are

2292
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,400
exciting

2293
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,679
but you haven't got a stable network

2294
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:48,960
service while all that's going on and

2295
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,340
again you've got that proactive

2296
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:52,260
Discovery rather than proactive link

2297
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:53,820
re-establishment which is wasting

2298
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:55,620
resources and particularly in the Mana

2299
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:58,860
environments that's not a problem so

2300
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,960
you'll note that the key issues have

2301
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,460
kind of been copy and pasted between

2302
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:04,380
these two environments because I think

2303
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:08,159
they are common problems to both of them

2304
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:11,299
next slide please

2305
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,280
so third answer that came out on the

2306
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,260
list is people said oh well dtn can

2307
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,380
solve this if you've got link outages we

2308
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:22,800
can do store and forward it's great we

2309
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,020
don't have to worry about the fact we

2310
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:27,060
can we can while we try and work out

2311
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,920
what the next thing is if something goes

2312
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,080
off for two hours dtn can save us dtn is

2313
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,360
great I am a chair of dtn and I can tell

2314
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:37,020
you dtn is great but it's a transport

2315
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:40,920
protocol it's for delivering data

2316
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:45,179
it doesn't do routing in fact we

2317
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,920
it's actually out of Charter at the

2318
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,480
moment for various iotf political

2319
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,239
reasons but well for scoping reasons not

2320
01:34:51,239 --> 01:34:52,920
political reasons there are problems we

2321
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,300
still have to solve before we try and

2322
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:56,340
solve routing and if TVR can come up

2323
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,500
with some of the routing problems

2324
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,980
dtn will use it dtn isn't an input to

2325
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,980
TVR dtn in fact would like to see the

2326
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:08,159
outputs of something like TVR so that

2327
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:10,260
kind of implies why I've started having

2328
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:12,060
these conversations at all

2329
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,260
um

2330
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,360
however there is some interesting

2331
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,040
research that is not happening with the

2332
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,199
ietf and experimentation and actually I

2333
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,060
think field it I'm looking to see if

2334
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,040
anyone who knows this is willing to nod

2335
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,620
if any of this is live uh particularly

2336
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:27,780
around uh what they call contact graph

2337
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:30,000
routing so that's an understanding that

2338
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,800
at a certain point in time two neighbors

2339
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,840
will see each other and therefore we can

2340
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:37,199
start moving dtn uh bundles their sort

2341
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,780
of jumbo packets between them and that's

2342
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:43,440
now become uh documented by uh ccsds

2343
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,120
which is the space governance community

2344
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,460
and called saber because it's a great

2345
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,600
acronym

2346
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,580
um schedule aware bundle routing and the

2347
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:51,840
reference there for anyone who wants to

2348
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,639
to look at it and it's

2349
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:56,460
what I find interesting is other

2350
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:58,860
communities they are aware that having a

2351
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:00,600
schedule and trying to move things

2352
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,600
around based on the schedule is a good

2353
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,739
idea

2354
01:36:04,739 --> 01:36:07,500
so again this is underlining going all

2355
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,659
the way back to Kevin's point which is

2356
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:12,900
this isn't new and I think that's a good

2357
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,159
thing

2358
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,860
because it kind of underlines that I

2359
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:18,840
think we've got a problem here so Keys

2360
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:22,080
is about gtn it's not a routing protocol

2361
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,520
and the second point is it doesn't

2362
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,440
actually deal with IP

2363
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,239
um for those who are unaware of dtn it's

2364
01:36:27,239 --> 01:36:30,120
got its own sort of jumbo packet format

2365
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,460
called a bundle because because of the

2366
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:33,900
nature of what dtn is and please come to

2367
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,219
our session at one o'clock it's great

2368
01:36:35,219 --> 01:36:37,320
and learn all about it anyway

2369
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:40,199
so that brings me on to really the

2370
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:43,139
potential work items

2371
01:36:43,139 --> 01:36:45,960
because if we're talking about forming a

2372
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,000
working group we ought to have some kind

2373
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,340
of discussion about what we should do

2374
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:52,020
I think we should have a formal use

2375
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:54,960
cases document it makes sense uh I am a

2376
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,520
huge fan of

2377
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,540
um

2378
01:36:57,540 --> 01:37:00,120
putting fence posts around the scope is

2379
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,639
how I like to describe it so you know

2380
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:04,679
quite clearly what's in and what's out

2381
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:06,300
because it's written down somewhere

2382
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:09,840
because it kind of allows people to have

2383
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,000
a common view about what we're trying to

2384
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,159
achieve here so problem statement use

2385
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,980
cases that kind of thing to make sure

2386
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:19,320
I just speaking as a chair it's really

2387
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,000
helpful within a working group to be

2388
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,159
able to say great conversation not in

2389
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:24,000
scope

2390
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,040
let's get something to describe this bit

2391
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,080
because it most definitely is in scope

2392
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,260
so I think use cases document is useful

2393
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:34,620
I think we should look at a general

2394
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:39,360
purpose solution for time variance and

2395
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,820
coordinate with other working groups who

2396
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:44,159
have the expertise on particular routing

2397
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:47,820
protocols I don't think

2398
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:51,300
it is correct or effective for a TVR

2399
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,880
working group to say we will write a bgp

2400
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,760
extension of some sort I think that's

2401
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:59,100
completely incorrect I think the TVR

2402
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,980
working group should look at

2403
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:04,199
understanding time variance and its

2404
01:38:04,199 --> 01:38:06,000
impact on routing and there's already

2405
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,280
discussions going on in the chat about

2406
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,320
what is a schedule what should go in a

2407
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,940
schedule is a schedule a good concept

2408
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,860
how do schedules get merged between

2409
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,960
nodes we can solve that without looking

2410
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,360
at the particulars of individual routing

2411
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,060
protocols but once we understand that

2412
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:23,699
and we've got information models we have

2413
01:38:23,699 --> 01:38:26,280
an understanding of what we will support

2414
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:28,739
with these schedules

2415
01:38:28,739 --> 01:38:31,199
um are we talking about link stuff or

2416
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:32,760
are we going to talk at the end-to-end

2417
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,260
service you know there's some

2418
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,880
interesting topics here once we've got

2419
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:39,239
that we can go out to the next date

2420
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:41,460
routing groups

2421
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:44,400
um Pym if we want to touch multicast you

2422
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,860
know some of the many groups uh whoever

2423
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:48,239
and say

2424
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:51,060
if have you considered time variance as

2425
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:53,340
part of your protocol stack if you have

2426
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:55,440
not here is some information models that

2427
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,320
we and some functional operations around

2428
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:01,400
the creation ingestion introspection

2429
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:04,500
updating whatever of these information

2430
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:07,260
models that you might know an elegant

2431
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:08,580
way to include into your routing

2432
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:11,940
protocol using your relevant LSA tlv

2433
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,440
whatever you're using within your

2434
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,239
protocol stack

2435
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:18,719
so it's don't do it here don't boil the

2436
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,060
ocean in summary so I just I know I'm

2437
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,679
running late and I'll be quick

2438
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:24,600
what I did want to write down is what I

2439
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:25,980
think is out of scope

2440
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:27,540
because this again is part of putting

2441
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,100
some fence posts and this is personal

2442
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,840
opinion

2443
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,179
it's a routing problem

2444
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:35,460
yeah it'd be great if applications knew

2445
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:37,679
all about it yeah it would be great if

2446
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:39,300
we could get into all sorts of other

2447
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,219
things but I think we have to start with

2448
01:39:41,219 --> 01:39:43,199
step one which is

2449
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:44,820
latter three let's get let's get the

2450
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,620
routing working because everything else

2451
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:48,900
will build from that

2452
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,900
um and therefore I think the following

2453
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:54,120
things get chucked out and it doesn't

2454
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:56,159
mean that they're not really cool things

2455
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:59,280
to look at I just think they're part two

2456
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,320
or three or four

2457
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,600
store and forward uh gtn's doing great

2458
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,280
stuff at the transport layer let's not

2459
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,300
go there

2460
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,000
that doesn't mean talking about buffers

2461
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,480
and understanding the transition when

2462
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,880
something scheduled happens isn't in

2463
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:15,900
scope

2464
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,179
but let's not talk about oh we could

2465
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:20,520
hold data for a very long time and then

2466
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,100
move it please leave that to transport

2467
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:25,080
and dtn at the moment

2468
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,179
I have the discussions but I don't think

2469
01:40:27,179 --> 01:40:29,340
I don't think it's go anything to do

2470
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:32,100
with making transport protocols schedule

2471
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:35,159
aware should definitely be a part two in

2472
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:37,440
my in my opinion I don't want to start

2473
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,739
touching the transport stuff tuning

2474
01:40:40,739 --> 01:40:45,060
um tcp's behavior when you know you know

2475
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,040
something's going to fail in in 20

2476
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,280
seconds please don't go there I think I

2477
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,139
mean great fun but we won't achieve

2478
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:54,480
anything you know it's a hard hard topic

2479
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,980
and I think we need the groundwork

2480
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:58,020
before we can sensibly start addressing

2481
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:59,400
that

2482
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,300
um

2483
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,580
I don't think it's worth getting into

2484
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:05,340
and I've said this earlier how we create

2485
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:09,060
the schedules how we do the prediction

2486
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:12,000
I think we should start at let's pretend

2487
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,820
we have a a prediction let's pretend we

2488
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:17,219
have some kind of schedule can we talk

2489
01:41:17,219 --> 01:41:19,980
about that and then other people go back

2490
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,719
to your day job and work out cool

2491
01:41:21,719 --> 01:41:24,659
techniques to create new schedules great

2492
01:41:24,659 --> 01:41:27,179
fun stuff but I out of scope almost for

2493
01:41:27,179 --> 01:41:29,340
the ietf definitely out of scope for a

2494
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,020
for a working group who can achieve

2495
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:31,860
things

2496
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:33,540
I'll go and quicker multi-custom

2497
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:34,739
multipath

2498
01:41:34,739 --> 01:41:38,360
personally they seem really hard

2499
01:41:38,699 --> 01:41:41,520
love what's the last bullet these are

2500
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,020
really cool topics but I strongly

2501
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:45,119
suggest we focus on the basics first

2502
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,659
the end

2503
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:52,500
yeah yeah no no it's absolutely fine I

2504
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:55,040
was repeating myself

2505
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,480
uh hi Kevin Paul um

2506
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:01,199
so I after lars's comment I it struck me

2507
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,060
a little bit that given what's happened

2508
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:05,699
in this kind of area in the past we when

2509
01:42:05,699 --> 01:42:08,460
when dtn work was a research group topic

2510
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:10,679
we intentionally confused the acronym in

2511
01:42:10,679 --> 01:42:12,900
its definition so that the D could be

2512
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:15,360
delay disruption whatever we want to

2513
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,699
have some research on would sort of be

2514
01:42:17,699 --> 01:42:19,800
in scope and I think what I'm hearing

2515
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,780
here is that oh that's like we don't

2516
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:24,420
want that for sure and so what is the

2517
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:26,520
scoping definition so I think Lara said

2518
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,980
was sort of on the order of an rtt maybe

2519
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:31,380
and and so I guess to maybe try to

2520
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:33,780
refine that might be useful

2521
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:36,420
what what is this covering and so just

2522
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:37,800
to throw out a couple

2523
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:40,260
uh you know so there was the use cases

2524
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,760
we had space and so on there's been

2525
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,500
underwater networks the prop the prop

2526
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,119
delay is five you know five orders of

2527
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:47,100
magnitude worse than it is on RF

2528
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:49,500
propagation so that's going to affect

2529
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,119
you know if you had rooting updates it

2530
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:52,800
would affect it would that be the type

2531
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,360
of thing would be in or out of scope

2532
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:56,520
because that's a world where you could

2533
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,920
have an end-to-end connection from the

2534
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:01,560
sender to the ultimate receiver but the

2535
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:03,060
properties of the network underneath are

2536
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:05,340
pretty different than what we would

2537
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:07,980
normally do so I I guess what I'm I'm

2538
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:09,659
not saying that's the one to worry about

2539
01:43:09,659 --> 01:43:12,300
but there's a few other features when

2540
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,179
you say you know rtt that needs to be

2541
01:43:15,179 --> 01:43:16,800
decomposed a little bit to mean like

2542
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:19,199
well really what what is that and and

2543
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,480
then if you're going to separate out the

2544
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:24,239
storm forward layer which is okay I

2545
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:25,800
suppose but then

2546
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,960
uh it would be interesting to to know

2547
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,900
what the communication if you will API

2548
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:34,320
is between those because scheduling you

2549
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,000
know back to the dynamic transship and

2550
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,300
all that stuff that's very interested in

2551
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,340
knowing what paths what links what

2552
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,679
places there are what storage facilities

2553
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:45,480
there are along the network and one

2554
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,860
other one that I don't think we heard

2555
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:50,100
about is like properties of nodes along

2556
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,320
the way and so at some point we had

2557
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,480
discussed some nodes being more reliable

2558
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:57,000
or more secure or located in certain

2559
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,639
geographies we trust or don't and so on

2560
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:00,960
and that would affect the routing

2561
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,639
decision as well and maybe that's an out

2562
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:05,159
of scope but all these a lot of richness

2563
01:44:05,159 --> 01:44:07,199
had been discussed over the years and

2564
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:08,400
what you might want to use in your

2565
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,960
routing decision

2566
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,420
it's all right

2567
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,280
I think we're not going to have time to

2568
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,679
go into all the questions but I think we

2569
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:18,420
should capture them and say these are

2570
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:20,100
items that we need to address as part of

2571
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:21,840
the working group or in scoping the

2572
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,119
working group so uh thank you for that I

2573
01:44:24,119 --> 01:44:25,500
think I got some good notes on that

2574
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,600
please check the the notepad to make

2575
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:32,179
sure we we got it correctly uh Brian

2576
01:44:34,139 --> 01:44:35,719
hello um

2577
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:38,159
one other thing that hadn't been

2578
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:40,739
discussed so far and is more of a gap

2579
01:44:40,739 --> 01:44:42,960
analysis than a use case is on the

2580
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:45,119
management side uh there are things like

2581
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:48,659
netconf that have a candidate data store

2582
01:44:48,659 --> 01:44:50,940
versus a running data store so there is

2583
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:53,340
a variation that's allowed but you can't

2584
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:55,679
schedule it and you only get one of them

2585
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:58,679
and so when the concept of multi-tenancy

2586
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:01,440
management comes into play

2587
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,060
um it really throws a wrench into things

2588
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,020
because

2589
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:05,280
you don't want to have to have a

2590
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,800
separate management

2591
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,360
Organization for every single time

2592
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,460
something might change in the future

2593
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:14,340
so just to ground some discussion in

2594
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:16,460
why you'd want to have a schedule

2595
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:18,840
for multiple things changing at their

2596
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:23,420
own at their own time rates

2597
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,980
yeah good comment uh in one of the

2598
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:28,139
earlier working groups this week someone

2599
01:45:28,139 --> 01:45:31,199
pointed out that uh there was a a

2600
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,179
working group that spent a lot of time

2601
01:45:33,179 --> 01:45:35,340
talking about how to document schedules

2602
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:37,199
so you know there are good building

2603
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:39,239
blocks in other working groups that we

2604
01:45:39,239 --> 01:45:41,400
definitely can can Leverage

2605
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,619
uh next

2606
01:45:43,619 --> 01:45:46,280
doorless

2607
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,480
yeah thank you very much um so one of

2608
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,760
one of the questions we usually or I'm

2609
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:53,520
trying to web out my mind is how do we

2610
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,560
get from here to some running code that

2611
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:57,119
does something useful right and I

2612
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:58,800
haven't seen very little unfortunate in

2613
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,179
the presentation that would give me a

2614
01:46:00,179 --> 01:46:01,560
really good hint for that

2615
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:05,100
if the you know way to get there is

2616
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:08,219
really mostly building a system out of

2617
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:10,679
mostly existing components in the ITF

2618
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:12,600
plugging them together the magical sdn

2619
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:15,540
controller that solves 99 a good amount

2620
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:17,880
of data models and then some app use of

2621
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:19,739
the routing system

2622
01:46:19,739 --> 01:46:21,300
um that that would be something that

2623
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:23,580
would be really good to show in some

2624
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,920
examples that that's the goal and then I

2625
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,960
mean we've got the example working

2626
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,940
groups that have done this kind of

2627
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:31,380
trying to use some build something

2628
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:33,420
useful with minimum additional work

2629
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:35,400
combining what we've done in the iitf my

2630
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:38,040
own animal working group probably is

2631
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,679
something like that right so 99 of was

2632
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:42,300
just plugging together things still a

2633
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:43,679
lot of work

2634
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,420
um so I'm not sure if that would then go

2635
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:47,639
into routing or Ops like they put enema

2636
01:46:47,639 --> 01:46:50,460
into Ops right if this is really a

2637
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:51,719
little bit more fishing and we don't

2638
01:46:51,719 --> 01:46:54,239
really know if we can come up with a

2639
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:57,780
such a big uh you know system design or

2640
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:59,639
um something that really we are very

2641
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:02,520
certain will give value then now we also

2642
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,980
have fairly good experience I think by

2643
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:06,540
now with the special interest group

2644
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:09,679
model that we're using in so far

2645
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:13,619
primarily in Ops with Mobs and iot Ops

2646
01:47:13,619 --> 01:47:16,020
right so but that puts you into more

2647
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:18,480
constraint about what your supposed and

2648
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:21,540
able to write in rfcs so just as process

2649
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:23,280
recommendations of where you might want

2650
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,380
to look into going the next steps making

2651
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:27,780
proposals toward some form of a working

2652
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:28,619
group

2653
01:47:28,619 --> 01:47:30,500
yeah thanks for that Toro us certainly

2654
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:32,760
after this meeting we're going to take

2655
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:35,940
all the feedback work with the ad the

2656
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:37,500
isg

2657
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,600
um and needed the IAB on what's next

2658
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,000
what you see here on the screen actually

2659
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,239
came with input from Alvaro of make sure

2660
01:47:45,239 --> 01:47:47,880
that what we come up with is attainable

2661
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,820
and actionable right you know we we can

2662
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:53,100
go deliver something and it's a probably

2663
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:55,460
a a Yang model or an information model

2664
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:59,460
uh and we get when we succeed at this we

2665
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:00,960
can talk about what happens after that

2666
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,600
yeah so just as a personal contributor I

2667
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,699
like the components right but I'd be a

2668
01:48:05,699 --> 01:48:08,280
lot more happy if is there some place

2669
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,840
that says and here is how these

2670
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,820
components can be mixed together to

2671
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:13,380
build a system that actually delivers

2672
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:16,139
value because just starting out throwing

2673
01:48:16,139 --> 01:48:18,600
components you know against the walls I

2674
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:20,100
see that it's required but not

2675
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,139
sufficient right I I would see that as

2676
01:48:22,139 --> 01:48:24,900
an objective you know it that comes

2677
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:26,699
under the approach framework

2678
01:48:26,699 --> 01:48:29,219
result it shouldn't just be here is some

2679
01:48:29,219 --> 01:48:31,380
stuff it should be here is relevant

2680
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:34,139
pieces and how they go together this is

2681
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:37,159
almost a recipe for you

2682
01:48:37,159 --> 01:48:40,139
so um I I like this this is really cool

2683
01:48:40,139 --> 01:48:42,060
stuff and uh we should definitely do

2684
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:44,100
this has a lot of um

2685
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:46,619
interesting different use cases and uh

2686
01:48:46,619 --> 01:48:48,840
yeah I mean we should go ahead um the

2687
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:51,239
only caveat that I would put on this or

2688
01:48:51,239 --> 01:48:53,159
a sort of little worry

2689
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:55,679
um is that there may be some sort of a

2690
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:58,380
chicken and egg problems hiding here and

2691
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:01,139
I I actually cut on on the line before

2692
01:49:01,139 --> 01:49:04,139
uh before the statement was made about

2693
01:49:04,139 --> 01:49:07,199
uh schedule creation being out of scope

2694
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:08,159
and

2695
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:11,159
that's a cute thing and um indeed like

2696
01:49:11,159 --> 01:49:13,139
the like you have this local and Global

2697
01:49:13,139 --> 01:49:15,780
Optima and you deciding what you're

2698
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:18,600
gonna do with your node may not actually

2699
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:21,360
like your local optimization may not be

2700
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,219
what you actually want for a lot of

2701
01:49:23,219 --> 01:49:24,840
these cases particularly when it comes

2702
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:28,080
to things like energy and energy is also

2703
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,540
sort of an interesting complicated case

2704
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:33,000
because you have so many like it's it I

2705
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,860
suppose noted it's pretty broad so you

2706
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,320
have you know different aspects to worry

2707
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,280
about

2708
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,600
um but also that you have different

2709
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,219
techniques you have

2710
01:49:41,219 --> 01:49:42,960
um for instance implementation

2711
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,760
techniques where you can put nodes into

2712
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:47,820
a relatively low power sleep states

2713
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:50,040
where they can still act as part of the

2714
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,080
network you don't have to tell anybody

2715
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,820
that you're sleeping but but you can

2716
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:56,639
still save a huge amount of energy or

2717
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:59,940
you can be sort of totally off and

2718
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:01,440
um and not

2719
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,360
um not respond to anything and then you

2720
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,980
have to tell the rest of the network so

2721
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:06,960
I think some of the use cases are sort

2722
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,000
of really straightforward that like a

2723
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,699
satellite is forced to go on a rotation

2724
01:50:11,699 --> 01:50:13,800
around Earth and you exactly know what's

2725
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,360
going to happen some of the other stuff

2726
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:16,940
where you start to

2727
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:19,739
compute that well you know there's these

2728
01:50:19,739 --> 01:50:22,199
criteria and these cost and and so on

2729
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:24,000
and they interact in interesting ways

2730
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,179
across uh parts of the network then that

2731
01:50:27,179 --> 01:50:31,320
gets more complicated but uh yeah so my

2732
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,840
advice is to stay as focused as possible

2733
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,060
don't try to solve everything just like

2734
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:38,580
the really simple case and deal with

2735
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:41,040
that and let's move on

2736
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,900
thank you Adrian

2737
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:46,139
hi Adrian Farrell thanks to the uh

2738
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:48,780
proponents and the chairs for really

2739
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:50,400
putting this together

2740
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,540
um

2741
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:55,320
I want to agree and disagree with Lars I

2742
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,060
want to agree that

2743
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:59,360
um there is part of this problem space

2744
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:03,420
is the time variant provision and

2745
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:07,860
awareness of service points and uh

2746
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:12,540
um direction of Transport paths and I

2747
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:14,820
want to disagree because I think this is

2748
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:16,880
about packet routing

2749
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:18,480
and

2750
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:22,020
um reaching inside the network uh and

2751
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:24,360
you know the the transport is an overlay

2752
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:27,360
over pocket routing and

2753
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:29,760
um we need to look at both of these

2754
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,800
problems or maybe all three of these

2755
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:34,500
problems in our analysis

2756
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,960
and work out which ones we are solving

2757
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,760
and then work out where to solve them

2758
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:41,219
and not just use the existence of one

2759
01:51:41,219 --> 01:51:42,840
problem to say well you can't talk about

2760
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:45,440
the other problem

2761
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:47,719
uh thanks

2762
01:51:47,719 --> 01:51:51,300
uh they are more Dynamic so just to

2763
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,100
clarify my previous Point time variant

2764
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,159
routing is an interesting problem but

2765
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,739
let's not it become kitchen sink for

2766
01:51:58,739 --> 01:52:00,000
everything else

2767
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,060
100 degree that's one thing let's define

2768
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:06,119
very clear problem that you want to

2769
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:08,940
solve and that we can solve

2770
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:11,460
for mesh networks so as long as you have

2771
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:13,800
a finite topology

2772
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:16,139
that you are managing

2773
01:52:16,139 --> 01:52:19,800
that's a single management domain then

2774
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,480
having

2775
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:24,840
a number of variations of your topology

2776
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:27,540
that will be changing on the schedule

2777
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:30,119
whatever their schedule might be that is

2778
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:32,300
being defined by that one management

2779
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:34,560
domain owner

2780
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,560
that's a problem that can be pretty well

2781
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:40,020
defined but if we try to

2782
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:43,320
and all other possible things in we were

2783
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:45,000
getting over

2784
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,239
can I respond quickly yeah I 100 agree

2785
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:49,800
with you for two reasons that's about as

2786
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,119
quick as you guys oh no I'm going

2787
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:53,280
quicker we're out of time so you can't

2788
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,020
schedule the whole internet and second

2789
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:57,000
of all we only have bandwidth to achieve

2790
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,679
something achievable so let's try and

2791
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:01,500
Achieve that yeah in full agreement

2792
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:04,800
uh Colin and I saw Lars come up and I

2793
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,600
don't know if you want to preempt the

2794
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,639
queue blockage okay okay

2795
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:10,980
hi uh Colin Perkins

2796
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,139
um

2797
01:53:12,139 --> 01:53:14,280
conferences with no hats let's be clear

2798
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:16,619
this is an area where obviously there's

2799
01:53:16,619 --> 01:53:18,840
been a lot of previous work and a lot of

2800
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:20,280
previous research

2801
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:23,880
um I um agree that it perhaps seems

2802
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:26,580
reasonable to try and explore uh whether

2803
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:28,320
we can do a focus standards activity

2804
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,960
here

2805
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:32,340
it's time to maybe narrow this work down

2806
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:35,639
and see what's feasible

2807
01:53:35,639 --> 01:53:37,800
um I think I'd Echo uh I think it was

2808
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,780
the comment allows me made

2809
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:40,619
um

2810
01:53:40,619 --> 01:53:43,560
think about the amount of time variance

2811
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,900
and the amount of Link latency you have

2812
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:48,480
in the network and draw bounds around

2813
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:50,100
what you're going to consider

2814
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:53,300
because it makes the scope fusible

2815
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:55,560
it also tells you whether you need to

2816
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:56,940
solve the transport problems or whether

2817
01:53:56,940 --> 01:54:00,320
you can use existing transport

2818
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:01,800
um

2819
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:04,199
I'd also say there are obviously many

2820
01:54:04,199 --> 01:54:07,440
different types of time varying networks

2821
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,360
um you know the lower phobic satellite

2822
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:12,480
someone which seems popular these days

2823
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,280
um Kevin I think mentioned underwater

2824
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:15,780
networks

2825
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:16,320
um

2826
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:17,880
some of these have a radically different

2827
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:19,920
properties and need ready you know

2828
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,179
radically different amounts of domain

2829
01:54:21,179 --> 01:54:24,840
expertise so before picking a particular

2830
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:26,880
scope over the edge the group to make

2831
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,440
sure it's got people with the relevant

2832
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:30,119
domain expertise just in case you

2833
01:54:30,119 --> 01:54:33,060
accidentally missed something

2834
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:34,980
yeah that's certainly a pretty important

2835
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:36,600
point about make sure we have the right

2836
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:39,320
people so we have uh six minutes left

2837
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:43,080
the plan is there's we're gonna do three

2838
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:44,820
polls they're already in the chat if you

2839
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:46,080
want to see what they're coming them

2840
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:48,600
coming and then we're gonna turn it over

2841
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:53,520
to uh ask the ad and our IAD advisor if

2842
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,260
they have anything to add and then we'll

2843
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:57,420
probably close out no we definitely will

2844
01:54:57,420 --> 01:54:59,940
close out sorry I should say probably

2845
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:04,280
so I'm going to get the first poll going

2846
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:06,678
foreign

2847
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:19,699
could you put the polls on the screen

2848
01:55:19,699 --> 01:55:22,260
yeah getting there

2849
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:24,560
sorry

2850
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:35,100
so the first question should we be

2851
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:39,320
working on this in the ITF

2852
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:41,900
um

2853
01:55:42,119 --> 01:55:44,580
we're getting I think a lot of positive

2854
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:47,040
response certainly more than half the

2855
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:51,239
room has said uh yes a few have said uh

2856
01:55:51,239 --> 01:55:54,060
I'll take the lower the hand as no but I

2857
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,639
think that's uh that's pretty

2858
01:55:56,639 --> 01:55:58,980
pretty clear we're going to move on to

2859
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:01,580
the next question

2860
01:56:04,139 --> 01:56:07,340
the next one is is

2861
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,960
do we need a new routing working group

2862
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:11,880
routing area working group

2863
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:14,900
to work this problem

2864
01:56:17,159 --> 01:56:19,139
that's not to say there won't be other

2865
01:56:19,139 --> 01:56:22,139
working groups in other areas to deal

2866
01:56:22,139 --> 01:56:24,119
with like transport

2867
01:56:24,119 --> 01:56:26,639
but we're focusing on the routing piece

2868
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:28,260
which actually I agree I don't remember

2869
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:29,580
who said it might have been Adrian we're

2870
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:32,780
about delivering packets

2871
01:56:40,699 --> 01:56:42,900
new group and routing area is the

2872
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:44,219
question do you think there should be

2873
01:56:44,219 --> 01:56:46,400
one

2874
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:52,440
so again we have a good percentage of

2875
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:54,179
people responding that's always a good

2876
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:57,719
thing but this time we have

2877
01:56:57,719 --> 01:56:59,540
um

2878
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:02,520
more of a split but still the majority

2879
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:05,840
are saying yes

2880
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,199
we're going to move on to the last

2881
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:09,739
question

2882
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:14,340
which is almost the most important one

2883
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:17,420
if I can find the button

2884
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:20,960
foreign

2885
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,699
are you willing to contribute and

2886
01:57:23,699 --> 01:57:25,800
contribute can be a reviewer it could be

2887
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:28,739
an author but basically show up and do

2888
01:57:28,739 --> 01:57:30,980
work

2889
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,619
if we don't have this there's sort of no

2890
01:57:34,619 --> 01:57:37,460
point in the other two

2891
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:47,000
questions

2892
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:53,239
oh

2893
01:57:56,840 --> 01:58:00,480
so I think here too it's very similar

2894
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,880
although there's

2895
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:05,219
um I'm actually a little confused by the

2896
01:58:05,219 --> 01:58:06,840
results

2897
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:09,599
um because the previous one it felt like

2898
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,820
there was more opposition and this one

2899
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:13,619
we have like more people say they're

2900
01:58:13,619 --> 01:58:16,380
willing to show up and do work so uh I

2901
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:18,659
guess this is the the most important

2902
01:58:18,659 --> 01:58:24,480
item so um with that uh with that I

2903
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:28,080
would like to so um so I see a iesg

2904
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:30,000
member getting up at the mic I'm going

2905
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,860
to ask if he's asking is is he coming as

2906
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:35,040
iesg or okay if you're coming as isg go

2907
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:36,480
right ahead if you're coming as a

2908
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:38,040
contributor please sit down

2909
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,040
sorry

2910
01:58:41,639 --> 01:58:42,480
um

2911
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,880
I think we just need to be to remember

2912
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:46,440
that you know

2913
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:48,300
obviously these aren't votes you know

2914
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:50,520
they are an education

2915
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:53,880
and I think my reading of this and this

2916
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,920
is from what I'm seeing here

2917
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:58,139
is that people are saying maybe it

2918
01:58:58,139 --> 01:59:00,420
shouldn't be in routing for the lost one

2919
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:02,580
but at the same time if it is we're

2920
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:04,380
still prepared to work on it that would

2921
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:08,340
be my how I would read that

2922
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:11,820
um yeah so that's just from you know

2923
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:13,560
from an ad perspective how we're

2924
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,360
evaluating this that's how I would read

2925
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,040
that

2926
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,900
reasonable because for example I think

2927
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:20,400
the answer is we should have multiple

2928
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:21,960
working groups because I think there's

2929
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:23,940
multiple problems so I could see if

2930
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:26,580
someone thought it was either or uh that

2931
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:28,679
so with that I

2932
01:59:28,679 --> 01:59:33,239
with that I'd actually like task Alvaro

2933
01:59:33,239 --> 01:59:35,400
and I think Valerie I think you're our

2934
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:38,400
uh IAB advisor if either of you would

2935
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:39,659
like to say anything and if you don't

2936
01:59:39,659 --> 01:59:42,500
that's okay too

2937
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:46,260
um sure um unlover the Thunder Road Andy

2938
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:48,719
uh first of all thank you everyone for

2939
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:52,020
coming today I think uh 134 people still

2940
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:55,139
at the end as uh a lot of people it uh

2941
01:59:55,139 --> 01:59:57,060
confirms one of the reasons why we

2942
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:59,580
wanted to do this buff is their

2943
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:02,040
interests in the problem and of course

2944
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,659
the poll have demonstrated that there is

2945
02:00:03,659 --> 02:00:06,060
interest people think there is a problem

2946
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:07,560
to solve people are willing to to

2947
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:09,900
contribute uh thank you to the chairs of

2948
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:11,639
course for running this to the

2949
02:00:11,639 --> 02:00:13,679
proponents

2950
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:15,599
um everyone I'm gonna just say the the

2951
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:17,940
obvious that everyone has been saying uh

2952
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:21,300
we need to scope down the problem uh

2953
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:24,599
this was a non-working group forming

2954
02:00:24,599 --> 02:00:28,199
buff which is precisely to gather

2955
02:00:28,199 --> 02:00:31,560
use cases to gather interest the area of

2956
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:33,599
potential application of TBR as everyone

2957
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:36,420
has said already is very very wide we

2958
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:38,040
need to narrow down we need to scope

2959
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:40,860
whatever we're going to do or can do in

2960
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,420
in the routing area or potentially

2961
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:43,400
elsewhere

2962
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:47,280
to things that we can deliver that we

2963
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,739
can work on they're going to be clear

2964
02:00:49,739 --> 02:00:51,599
um so that's what I would like to see

2965
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:53,580
being discussed in the main list going

2966
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:54,480
forward

2967
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,580
what are the

2968
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:58,260
I don't know one two three whatever

2969
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:01,679
deliverables that we can go uh and try

2970
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:03,179
to move forward

2971
02:01:03,179 --> 02:01:05,040
um and as we see that discussion we're

2972
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,000
going to

2973
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,099
evaluate that and figure out what what

2974
02:01:08,099 --> 02:01:09,900
the next steps are going to to be after

2975
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:11,639
the discussion so again thank you so

2976
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:12,659
much

2977
02:01:12,659 --> 02:01:14,219
thank you

2978
02:01:14,219 --> 02:01:16,920
Mallory noodle Center for democracy and

2979
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:19,619
Technology um I think Russ also was here

2980
02:01:19,619 --> 02:01:21,300
from the IAB and so

2981
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:23,340
um it's not only me

2982
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:25,260
um but I guess some of so because I'm

2983
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:27,119
not a domain expert

2984
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:31,139
um as I sort of look at the baf

2985
02:01:31,139 --> 02:01:33,239
um some of the questions I recall from

2986
02:01:33,239 --> 02:01:35,460
the things we evaluate are gonna I'm

2987
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:37,380
going to focus on where else is this

2988
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:39,719
work happening I I saw earlier in some

2989
02:01:39,719 --> 02:01:42,060
of the presentations some of this is itu

2990
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:43,139
related

2991
02:01:43,139 --> 02:01:44,400
um all of that is going to be really

2992
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,020
helpful information

2993
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:47,699
um for for me as I go through that

2994
02:01:47,699 --> 02:01:50,760
questionnaire so anyone who wants to

2995
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,980
um yeah I just I would say I will

2996
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:55,619
appreciate anyone who can respond for to

2997
02:01:55,619 --> 02:01:57,900

02:01:57,900 --> 02:01:59,520
you all as the

2999

um delegates

3000
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:02,460
um about about those sorts of things

3001
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:03,719
that I don't quite understand but that's

3002
02:02:03,719 --> 02:02:05,159
sort of the nature of the review that we

3003
02:02:05,159 --> 02:02:06,960
do but it's great to see all the

3004
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:08,880
interests I think that's a strong sign

3005
