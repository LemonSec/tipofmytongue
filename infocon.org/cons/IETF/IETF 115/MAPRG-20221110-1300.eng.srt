00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,879
the goals of the irtf is to do research

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,599
work and but coincidentally with the ITF

57
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,120
meetings and but we're not a standards

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,160
organization so uh if you're new to the

59
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,020
irtf just realize it's a little

60
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,300
different uh than than what happens in

61
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,220
the ITF in some ways it's a little

62
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,080
looser and it's got a slightly different

63
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,720
Focus so there's a primer that you can

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,220
read linked there if if you're new

65
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,260
so here's the charter from App RG the

66
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,000
measurement analysis protocols research

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,739
group is generally a group that's about

68
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,640
uh studying uh the uh the protocols

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,040
defined by the ietf in measurement in

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,459
practice and on in operation and also

71
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,620
techniques sometimes to measure internet

72
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,560
protocols that's primarily our Focus uh

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,840
there's a mailing list of course and you

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,760
can subscribe to it linked there

75
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,159
There's the link to say slides and media

76
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,239
go

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,340

87
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,580
your turn

88
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,159
so the agenda for today is uh um once we

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,519
time the time of the year that it's

93
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,080
coincident with the internet measurement

94
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,720
conference uh one of the top academic

95
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,459
research conferences having to do with

96
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,680
internet measurement uh we've got a

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,420
number of contributions from that were

98
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,459
presented just recently or accepted and

99
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,040
presented at IMC and then Mary and I

100
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,840
also solicited some that we thought were

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
particularly appropriate for uh for for

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,640
map RG and that's what we're going to

103
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,920
need today in addition to as usual a

104
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,900
couple new topics of unpublished Works

105
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,360
in either case uh please share your

106
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,579
ideas especially uh from a standards and

107
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,858
operational point of view with the

108
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,380
authors or uh if we have time here in

109
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,880
the question and answer portion after

110
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,220
each talk so we're going to do uh first

111
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,060
off uh a short talk by Pablo foremsky uh

112
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,259
about uh a system they did called Kirin

113
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,660
about uh

114
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,940
distributed advertisements and ipv6bgp

115
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,740
then we're going to go into a series of

116
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,940
15-minute talks

117
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,860
um some of which are from

118
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,960
um some of which are unpublished and so

119
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,259
much are from IMC waiting for a quick uh

120
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,960
I believe that's uh uh up on there's a

121
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
link in the in the meeting materials to

122
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
uh the pre-print for that on archive uh

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,520
authors please correct me if I'm wrong

124
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,860
if I got it got one that was that was

125
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,419
already published in it and I said it

126
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,360
wasn't uh DNS privacy with speed uh

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Robin marks will be presenting that uh

128
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,020
and that's an IMC uh contribution

129
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,699
first look at Starling performance

130
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,860
another IMC contribution that we that we

131
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,680
accepted from Francois and then

132
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,979
eliminating large-scale IPv6 scanning uh

133
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,500
another IMC contribution from Philip

134
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,440
Richter and his collaborators and then

135
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,080
Leslie Daigle will come up with a new

136
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,180
piece of work

137
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,639
about iot security by the numbers and

138
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,680
Ignacio Castro will be up next with

139
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,880
kovatus ietf uh considering uh something

140
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,160
unusual measuring the ietf itself and

141
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,380
whether or not it's ossified so sort of

142
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,759
a little variation on the kind of

143
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,500
measurements we typically look at and

144
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,759
then we'll close out with the Tom

145
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,419
akawate talking about where.ru

146
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,300
um looking at the uh the conflict in the

147
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,520
war in the Ukraine and about assessing

148
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,380
the impact on that how can you study

149
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,479
that based on the what we see in the DNS

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,060
so that's the agenda for today as I said

151
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,800
we just got about 10 more minutes than

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,419
the time we've given to each author

153
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,919
there so

154
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,419
um keep that in mind when you're getting

155
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,880
into queue and why I closed it or why we

156
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,659
closed it when we did

157
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,819
um before we switch to Pavel um Pavel if

158
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,520
you're ready you can propose your slides

159
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,740
and switch to them right after this

160
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,860
um uh here one of the one of the uh

161
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,539
potential contributions that we couldn't

162
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,000
fit in this time was a short paper from

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,940
IMC uh and they wanted to let you know

164
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,800
they provided these slides for us as a

165
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,840
heads up about the they're creating a

166
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,060
test bed for low earth orbit uh

167
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,479
satellite ISP systems and uh you can

168
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,020
contact Muhammad who's address whose

169
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,340
email address is

170
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,620
in the IMC the first software online MC

171
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,840
paper here and read their short IMC

172
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,479
paper about measuring uh our browser

173
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,819
side view of starlink connectivity and

174
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,100
then lastly Muhammad offered to share

175
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,479
with you is they're starting up a new

176
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,259
series of a webinar series called leocon

177
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,759
um that he says is bi-monthly I'm

178
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,319
assuming that means every other month as

179
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,880
opposed to two times a month

180
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,979
and uh but if you're interested in that

181
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,780
there's the information and a link to it

182
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,800
there

183
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,360
yeah I'm not sure I'll give you a moment

184
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,580
okay

185
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,460
all right do we have Pavel I don't see

186
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,780
um

187
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,060
oh he's here okay you mean here in

188
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,720
London

189
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,960
all right so I will stop

190
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,979
sharing these

191
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,479
all right take away Pablo you got uh

192
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,819
five minutes

193
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:54,960
all right

194
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,460
hello everyone

195
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,919
I'm Pavel from the Polish Academy of

196
00:07:58,919 --> 00:07:59,940
Sciences

197
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,740
I'm here today to shortly present you

198
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,139
our new paper with Android play with

199
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,360
Lars and Oliver from the Max Planck

200
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,759
Institute for informatics

201
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,639
in Disney paper we are asking ourselves

202
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,800
whether we should reconsider a

203
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,840
well-known prefix aggregation attack

204
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,479
against bgp and in this talk I will

205
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,340
shortly mention three points

206
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,400
first a new context for this attack then

207
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,560
some results and recommendations for bgp

208
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,060
operators

209
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,099
next slide please

210
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,399
excellent okay

211
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,559
so first the context

212
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,620
as you probably know bgp routers don't

213
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,380
have unlimited space for their fips and

214
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,559
rip tables mostly because sticker memory

215
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,120
is expensive for instance

216
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,519
so if you manage to announce too many

217
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,060
routes to a bgp router many bad things

218
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,440
can happen to it for instance it can

219
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,040
crash and what if we manage to overflow

220
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,040
not one or few erupters but many routers

221
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,480
that run the internet

222
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,480
so we are revisiting a well-known prefix

223
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,600
the aggregation attack but we add a few

224
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,080
new things that we believe that can

225
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
convince uh the community that this

226
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
attack might be actually easier to

227
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,620
exploit than previously thought

228
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,740
so first we are using IPv6 since it's

229
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,700
much easier to obtain a large V6

230
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,680
prefixes compared with V4 for instance

231
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,920
slash 29 allocation which is easy to

232
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,420
obtain for a leader because it doesn't

233
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,180
need additional justification

234
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,000
that could allow you to split it into a

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,220
million possible sub prefixes up to such

236
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,680
48 which is good for bgp that is it

237
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,420
propagates globally

238
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,120
then we no longer need to be physically

239
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
present at facilities like XPS to

240
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,820
establish bgp sessions

241
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,800
for instance more than 10 percent of

242
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,779
peers at the larger XPS are they are

243
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,980
remote or the five bucks VM at Walter

244
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,860
already has an option for free bgp

245
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,940
Transit sessions is a session per hvm

246
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,839
so in the paper we also show how one can

247
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
use a pool of distributed bgp sessions

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,240
to work around bgp Max prefix limits and

249
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,980
the prefix aggregation

250
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,899
and finally we found that for some

251
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,600
operators rpki can sometimes actually

252
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,839
help you since a single raw records with

253
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,660
a max length will get you through a rod

254
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,120
filter for each subprefix compared with

255
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
robbed objects there is no need to put

256
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,320
so many objects into irr

257
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
next slide

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,080
foreign

259
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,760
so some results

260
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,440
is it possible to launch queuing today

261
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,779
against the internet

262
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:46,140
So based on simulations on real bgp data

263
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,760
real infrastructure that runs the

264
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,120
internet We Believe now sorry CS

265
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,120
here for instance on the left hand side

266
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,920
you see a result of optimization of how

267
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,200
many Transit providers and how many

268
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,779
pyramid glands you need to obtain a

269
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,959
given number of V6 sessions so for a big

270
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,240
enough attacker like state sponsored

271
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,959
attack

272
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,079
using just 20 providers at 25 lands you

273
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,180
can obtain more than a thousand V6

274
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,140
sessions

275
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,959
even if those sessions have Max prefix

276
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,180
limit of a thousand this setup alone

277
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,240
would could allow you to announce more

278
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,320
than a million new V6 prefixes alone

279
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,360
next slide

280
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,000
so the answer is yes we also did some

281
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,300
lab experiments using real routers that

282
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,740
run the internet

283
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,079
here for instance we used a real Juniper

284
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,779
MX5 router it's quite popular and the

285
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,019
virtual Cisco XR v9 and we checked how

286
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,180
many routes we can announce to it unless

287
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,680
it crashes

288
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,140
in the best case where the aspartland

289
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,240
was just one and with our bgp

290
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,640
communities the numbers were 2 million

291
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,860
and 5 million respectively for Juniper

292
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,600
and Cisco however in the worst case

293
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,459
which is here in Orange

294
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,760
if we maxed our as paths so it has the

295
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,060
maximum length and we added as many

296
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,940
large bdp communities as we could the

297
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,500
numbers were 100K and a million

298
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,980
respectively of course this is not uh

299
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,500
completely realistic but it shows some

300
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,480
bound

301
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,459
but we run these experiments on Empty

302
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,500
Tables and with minimal router

303
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,839
configuration so if you consider reality

304
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,839
that now V4 plus V6 internet is 1.1

305
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,240
million combined there is likely little

306
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,160
Headroom ahead so we normally you

307
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,380
wouldn't need to announce a new one

308
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,680
million V6 rods to crush the routers

309
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
next slide

310
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,120
so finally what should I do first of all

311
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,139
don't worry

312
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,500
yeah like it's quite easy to detect we

313
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,620
encourage more monitoring uh that there

314
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,779
isn't someone preparing for this attack

315
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,519
and we came up with a few

316
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,440
recommendations for operators for

317
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,200
instance we argue for dynamic Max prefix

318
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,240
limits that are updated daily

319
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,639
and we think we might start thinking

320
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,740
about new kinds of limits for bgp

321
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,540
sessions for instance limit the number

322
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,360
of routes a single as can originate into

323
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,639
the global routing table or the number

324
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,620
of more specifics for each assigned

325
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,680
block or per each 32 prefix cover and

326
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,240
prefix for Simplicity

327
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,339
finally we encourage you not to blindly

328
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,639
rely on peeringdb values since this can

329
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,040
be controlled by the attacker so we need

330
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,899
to add scientific checks

331
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,180
next slide

332
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,180
okay

333
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,459
thanks a lot bubble I'm just going to

334
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,139
say yeah put your contact information up

335
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,519
and we can invite people if they have

336
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,560
questions thanks for coming to fit in

337
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,399
such a short session

338
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,540
are there questions or comments from the

339
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,839
audience

340
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,459
go ahead and say

341
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,760
yes

342
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,700
I hope this encourages you to encourage

343
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,980
you uh in the paper we also discuss

344
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,899
responsible disclosure process that we

345
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,660
run thank you so much so read the papers

346
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,439
thank you

347
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,420
right

348
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,600
um let's move on to uh Jonas mook's

349
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,139
presentation

350
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,279
networking

351
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,939
change

352
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,819
I don't know

353
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,920
okay can you try again sorry that's my

354
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,079
fault I think okay

355
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,579
no there we are

356
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,699
oh maybe not it should be the third one

357
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,480
all right so you have 15 minutes okay

358
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,760
I'm from fry University at Berlin and uh

359
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,440
today I'm going to present about passive

360
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,660
measurement opportunities uh using quick

361
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,639
and this joint work with machines

362
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,160
Patrick Johannes Georg Thomas and

363
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,639
Matthias in this work we'll focus on uh

364
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,079
hypergiant deployments so we should

365
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,639
first have a common understanding of how

366
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,500
a typical hypergiant deployment might

367
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,660
look like and this is what you can see

368
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,480
here on the slides so usually a user

369
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,240
will resolve a domain using DNS and go

370
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,459
in return to get an IP address in the

371
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,740
case of hypergines that will often be a

372
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,440
virtual IP address so it does not uh

373
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,600
um represent just one host but multiple

374
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,139
hosts can answer uh requests for this IP

375
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,139
address and then the user will use any

376
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:46,500
protocol to connect to the hyper using

377
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,600
this IP address to the hyper Giant and

378
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,660
then at the hyper giant the request will

379
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,459
pass through multiple layers of load

380
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,920
distribution using ecmp for example and

381
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,100
then multiple layers of

382
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,500
local lenses so layer 4 and layer 7 load

383
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,100
balances throughout this presentation

384
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,220
I'll refer to online deployments as

385
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,139
deployments that are within the

386
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,120
autonomous system of a hypergiant for

387
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,279
example Facebook and too often have this

388
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,920
deployments as deployments that are

389
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,760
outside the autonomous system of that

390
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,079
type of job can you get a little bit

391
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,959
closer to that sure

392
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:27,899
okay hope that's better better

393
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,720
and what has uh what have passed

394
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,820
measurement studies done so

395
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,980
um past measurement Studies have

396
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,079
conducted active quick scans so they

397
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,060
maybe send out requests to the entire

398
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,220
for example ipv4 address space or they

399
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,920
have used DNS to infer the number of IP

400
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,980
addresses and used by hypergiants or how

401
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,680
many domains they use but what we focus

402
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,639
in this work is we want to understand

403
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,380
the content serving infrastructure of

404
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,320
hyper Giants so we want to understand

405
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,480
the last part which you can see here in

406
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,860
the slides so the layer cell and load

407
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,420
balances

408
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,400
and

409
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,559
um how we do this is we first identify

410
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,839
service of specific hypergines and their

411
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,640
server configurations and then we use

412
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,740
those detected server configurations to

413
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,859
identify off-net servers and then as a

414
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,559
last step we'll look into how they

415
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,599
how they deploy their layer 7 load

416
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,280
balances and we do this in a

417
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,260
non-obtrusive way well how do we do this

418
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,059
we do this by analyzing quick

419
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,540
Backscatter traffic and why do we use

420
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,080
Quick well it's already broadly used by

421
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,539
hyper Giants so for example in 2020

422
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,880
already 75 of Facebook's traffic is

423
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,559
quick so we're gonna see a lot of this

424
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,919
and we can use it and why do we use

425
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,780
Backscatter well it's a non-intrusive

426
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,440
and relatively easy to capture data

427
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,400
source

428
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,340
so um here you can see our measurement

429
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,760
setup basically we use back sketches

430
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,919
back skater is just response traffic

431
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,820
from a spoofed packets

432
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,679
so if an attacker sends a smooth packet

433
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,900
to a server the server then replies to

434
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,059
that spoofed address and if that Spirit

435
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,679
address is in the range of our Network

436
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,600
telescope which is just an IP address

437
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,000
range we can see these packets and

438
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,640
conduct our analysis on them and for the

439
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,200
quick handshake that you see here in the

440
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,539
middle that usually means this an

441
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,760
attacker will send an initial packet and

442
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,679
then the server will reply with initial

443
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,200
intent check packets and so that is so

444
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,960
that is what we um what we observe in

445
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,720
the telescope and what we can

446
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,820
additionally see here is that quick uses

447
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,820
connection IDs and during the connection

448
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,059
setup each endpoint so the client and

449
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,460
the server determine the

450
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,220
um connection ID that is used to

451
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,160
Identity to assign packets to

452
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,280
um to Quick connections at that endpoint

453
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,340
and the connection IDs are set by the

454
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,020
respective side of

455
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,780
um of connection

456
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,880
so what data do we use well we use the

457
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,700
k-19 ipv4 network telescopes array to

458
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,860
fully large telescope and we use data

459
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,679
from January of 2022 and we're necessary

460
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,799
we expanded our data set using active

461
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,140
measurements this included quick TLS and

462
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,360
DNS scans

463
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,080
and uh so first we had a look so what so

464
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,900
what you can see on this slide is

465
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,980
um the

466
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,140
reception of Packers at the network

467
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,059
telescope for different quick

468
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,160
connections and we can see is that there

469
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,740
are um distinct patterns for different

470
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,440
hypergines when they resend packets so

471
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,419
what you can observe is that Facebook

472
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,640
starts to resend packets after a certain

473
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,559
interval and you can also see like the

474
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,039
intervals get doubled in size each time

475
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,380
so what we what we learned from this is

476
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,780
that they use explanation back off and

477
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,220
we can also if we look at the beginning

478
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,559
of the graph we can also determine the

479
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,419
retransmission timers so after which

480
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,600
time they resend the packets and if we

481
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,419
just count the Peaks we can also

482
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,940
determine how many Transmissions of

483
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,000
packets occur and the details are

484
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,980
different for different type of giants

485
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,200
so next we'll have a look at the server

486
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,780
connection IDs so the connection IDs

487
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,120
that are set by the service and we'll

488
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,559
have a look at the hexadeciminal

489
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,780
representation of those from left to

490
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,940
right this is what you can see in those

491
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,780
graphs so on the x-axis you see the

492
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,480
position in the connection ID and on the

493
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,919
y-axis you see the value that we

494
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,840
observed there or better the frequency

495
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,780
that we observe there and what we find

496
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,600
is that Google and Facebook use the same

497
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,220
length of connection IDs while

498
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,559
cloudflare has significantly larger 20

499
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,100
byte long connection IDs and we see that

500
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,320
some values are more frequently used

501
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,840
than others while for Google we observe

502
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,340
just a random distribution of values and

503
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,559
what this means is that there is

504
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,179
information encoded in the connection

505
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,700
IDs and in fact if you look at the

506
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,500
implementations you can find details

507
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,900
about this for example Facebook this

508
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,480
includes a version host ID work ID and

509
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,260
process ID field

510
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
so

511
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,740
um now we will use this information so

512
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,340
we know that Facebook's host connection

513
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,260
IDs will always begin with the version

514
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,179
and we know the values of that version

515
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,919
so we can now use this to fingerprint

516
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,020
hyper Giant deployments and if we do so

517
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,240
we can

518
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,919
um relatively accurate

519
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,159
um find Facebook service and we still

520
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,260
have a

521
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,840
some false positives but we can reduce

522
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,880
those with additional information so

523
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,919
what we found during our measurements is

524
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,860
that Facebook uses uh low host IDs those

525
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,380
host IDs are also part of the connection

526
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,260
ID so we can additionally predict the

527
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,280
first

528
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,000
um

529
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,360
the first positions of the host host ID

530
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,419
so we can now use 11 bits of a 64-bit

531
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,960
connection ID to predict uh which

532
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,419
service our Facebook off net servers and

533
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,880
so we can significantly reduce the

534
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,620
number of holes positives

535
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,179
so now the question is why would you

536
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,400
actually need to encode host IDs well

537
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,740
classically the layer follow-up lenses

538
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,280
forward packets using a consistent

539
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,919
hashing on the five Tuple and that works

540
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,679
fine for UDP and TCP connections but for

541
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,500
quick it's possible that these that the

542
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,900
ports or the IP address changes during

543
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,299
an existing quick connection so for

544
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,039
example during client migration the IP

545
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,960
address might change and in that case

546
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,179
layer 4 load planser would generate a

547
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:46,679
different hash and forward to a

548
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,240
different host ID which would break the

549
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,200
connection

550
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
so a simple solution to this is you

551
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,700
encode the host ID which is visible to

552
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,159
the layer 4 load balancer and use this

553
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,919
host ID to forward packets

554
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,140
and that's

555
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,539
that's what you can do and this avoids

556
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,520
that you have to share State between the

557
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,340
layer 7 and the layer 4 load balances or

558
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,220
uh to any other things to look into look

559
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,440
deeper into the connection

560
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,860
um yeah

561
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,980
and so now that we know that what the

562
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,260
hostage is actually denominate so that's

563
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,780
the layers that's the layer 7 load

564
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,059
balances so where the quick connection

565
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:28,740
terminates uh we conducted in active

566
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,900
measurements so we send out our packets

567
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,260
to Facebook servers um and Etc and so we

568
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,179
connect 20 000 times to those Facebook

569
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,360
servers and then we collect the

570
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,880
um Server Connection IDs and extract the

571
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,000
host IDs from that and if we do so we

572
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,320
get around 37 000 different host IDs of

573
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,440
which already we can see in 19

574
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,659
in the passive measurement data set and

575
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,539
if we now group group those

576
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:58,320
um

577
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,360
the virtual IP addresses that we scanned

578
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,240
into clusters if they share at least one

579
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,860
host ID we get to this picture and this

580
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,000
this is uh 112 different clusters each

581
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
of the size of 22 virtual IP addresses

582
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,340
and there are three clusters that differ

583
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,120
between size so there's one with 22

584
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,940
um 20 and 44 virtual IP addresses and

585
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,440
what we find is that each of these

586
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,240
clusters only spans a single 24 IP

587
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,520
prefix while there's one exception to

588
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,100
this Rule and what we found is that

589
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,039
single cluster it's not a single cluster

590
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:41,159
behind behind up here behind the virtual

591
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,620
IP addresses

592
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,400
we can

593
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,460
uh we always detect the same number of

594
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,340
host Eddies so not only one host ID is

595
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,140
shared behind the virtual IP addresses

596
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,720
but all host IDs in general so if you

597
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,640
want to derive information about the

598
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,740
cluster it's sufficient to scan just one

599
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,340
virtual IP address and you know how many

600
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,260
different host IDs there are in this

601
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,799
cluster so ultimately we use Simple ipeg

602
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,400
allocation to geolocate the Clusters and

603
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,980
what we then found was that the Clusters

604
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,679
in Asia are significantly larger than in

605
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,140
any other continent and this was

606
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,780
surprising to us first but we found that

607
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,700
Facebook has fewer data centers there

608
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,580
and the population is pretty large so

609
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,000
that's probably the reason for this

610
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,940
so will this approach uh work in the

611
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,580
future well uh we think there will be no

612
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,440
internet without attackers so there will

613
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,480
always be back Sketcher and so we can

614
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,039
use this approach

615
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,260
um to further analyze hypergiant

616
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,140
deployments and we even think that the

617
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,760
back scatter will increase because it's

618
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,460
not yet at a level of TCP and this will

619
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,279
increase increase likely with um

620
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,779
with further adoption of quick

621
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,279
so to conclude

622
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,960
um we have learned we can use passive

623
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,760
measurements um to learn a lot about

624
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,100
hypergiant deployments and we can then

625
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,960
use what we learned to create

626
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,940
fingerprints and detect of net servers

627
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,100
and we have seen that structure

628
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,380
connection IDs can be used to simplify

629
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,200
routing there's already an ITF draft for

630
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,260
this so maybe have a look at this this

631
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,260
will also not reveal your layer 7 loop

632
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,700
and answer infrastructure in the default

633
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,279
configuration with that thank you for

634
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,779
your attention you can find more details

635
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,380
in our paper

636
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,940
thanks a lot Jonas

637
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,380
um we've got a couple of folks in the

638
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,120
queue already and a few minutes to take

639
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,760
questions and for you to respond so uh

640
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,059
looks like Lorenzo is up go ahead yeah

641
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,220
out of curiosity um

642
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,840
why is it

643
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,340
why is it interesting that this is

644
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,200
passive measurements I mean it feels

645
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,520
like you could just go to like any

646
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,620
random airport lounge or like coffee

647
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,120
shop on the internet and conduct these

648
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,960
measurements actively and I mean this

649
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,520
would work perfectly well for active

650
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,380
measurements as well right yeah yeah it

651
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,580
works for active measurements but it's

652
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,740
interesting because uh for example you

653
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,779
can analyze your competitors and it's

654
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,279
non-intrusive so you don't have to send

655
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,200
all packets you save some traffic and

656
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,440
load

657
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,700
Benjamin you want to go

658
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,960
hi

659
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,539
uh benchwartz alphabet

660
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,059
first

661
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,179
do you have any understanding of why

662
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,539
somebody is spoofing your telescopes

663
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:33,440
Source IPS

664
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,720
what benefit does it convert on any

665
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,059
attacker or or anybody in the world to

666
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,159
spoof The Source IPS that are inside

667
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,140
your network telescope

668
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,360
there's no incentive to do this just for

669
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,039
the network telescope the idea is just

670
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,440
to move a random IP address and if that

671
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,700
IP address is in the range of our

672
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,860
telescope we will observe the response

673
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,480
right but okay but if there is no

674
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,100
incentive for them to spoof those IPS

675
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,140
why are they doing it

676
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,620
this allocates state at your servers so

677
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,360
um you you

678
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,880
um yeah so you take out capacity that

679
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,679
would could be used to sort of

680
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,020
legitimate requests otherwise

681
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,500
okay so thank you so it sounds like the

682
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,520
these are uh Source spoof DDOS attacks

683
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,340
uh on the target infrastructure not

684
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,020
reflection attacks

685
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,159
yes okay thanks uh and my other question

686
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,419
is

687
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,360
based on this observation would you

688
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,880
recommend the use of

689
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,100
uh of

690
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,700
it block Cipher approaches to quick

691
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,200
connection ID

692
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,020
uh generation or in general you know

693
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,140
randomized connection IDs that have no

694
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,059
visible patterns like like you saw in

695
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,740
the Google servers

696
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,620
I would suggest to look at the draft um

697
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,299
at this this Heights the this

698
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,980
information that we have seen like for

699
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,900
Facebook and used

700
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,559
um

701
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,039
but uh you will always try to have some

702
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,779
information to make routing of your

703
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,059
quick packets easier

704
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,460
oh right but if you encrypt the

705
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,700
connection IDs then you can have that

706
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,919
routing you know without revealing any

707
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,980
information yes externally I wonder if

708
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,360
you have a record you know if you think

709
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,919
that there's a best practice here

710
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,520
effectively

711
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,440
I'm not sure about this

712
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,840
all right thanks Ben um why don't you

713
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,700
guys uh carry on with it with the draft

714
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,520
and or contact uh Jonas outside and

715
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,360
let's switch to Marwan uh R1 fan just in

716
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,679
the interest of time they're not

717
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,000
necessarily an answer required here but

718
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,860
I think an interesting question is uh

719
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,779
rather than what is the structure that

720
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,940
you can see is how are people achieving

721
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,919
the lack of structure especially if you

722
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,080
want to preserve that connectivity

723
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,340
um seems to me an interesting question

724
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,559
that might be useful

725
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,419
in order to prevent people from deriving

726
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,919
structure

727
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,140
thank you

728
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,580
hello all right thank you thanks a lot

729
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,240
John Eunice

730
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:10,200
all right so next up we have Robin marks

731
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,760
and I think he's there with you right

732
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Miriam yes

733
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,020
or should I

734
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,700
uh why don't you do attention through

735
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,940
there

736
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,480
for me

737
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,740
some of it

738
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:35,600
all right Robin you've got 15 minutes

739
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,720
yes please

740
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,460
hello everyone first of all some context

741
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,260
I'm not one of the main authors of this

742
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,480
paper uh I was mainly as a kind of a

743
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,159
consultant on more of the quick and web

744
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,380
performance parts but the main authors

745
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,820
couldn't be here today and so I'm

746
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,740
falling in as a presenter next slide

747
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,840
please

748
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,500
I'm sorry

749
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,539
there you go yeah a bit more context

750
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,700
this is kind of a continuation paper

751
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,140
from a

752
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,880
previous paper earlier this year that

753
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,520
was presented to ietfs Ago by the same

754
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,720
team the main differences I'm sorry the

755
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,100
main differences between the two papers

756
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,260
are that we now have a severely updated

757
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,240
DNS over quick implementation mainly

758
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,460
adding session resumption which helped

759
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,080
with quite a few bugs relating to things

760
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,419
like application prevention which

761
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,220
kind of muddled the results in the first

762
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,380
version we now also do measurements from

763
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,120
multiple Vantage points instead of just

764
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,880
one and of course we now add it we don't

765
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,500
just look at the DNS performance which

766
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,419
we did in the first paper now we also

767
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:38,399
look at that performance impact from the

768
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,980
DNS performance so there's basically two

769
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,539
parts of this paper I'm only going to

770
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,480
talk about the second part today

771
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,559
to keep time next slide please

772
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,640
um why do we want to look at web

773
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,620
performance most of the web contents are

774
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,659
still already over https but we still

775
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,760
have some privacy leakage over DNS

776
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,039
obviously this is partially resolved by

777
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,039
Dot and Doh but of course we pay a heavy

778
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,840
performance penalty due to the handshake

779
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,880
that needs to happen the idea or the

780
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,039
hope is that quick with its 1 rtt or

781
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,440
zero TT handshake can help alleviate

782
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,179
some of these problems like I said

783
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:13,919
that's an idea it's not yet been

784
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,840
confirmed and that's why we wanted to do

785
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,480
some some practical measurements on that

786
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,279
next slide

787
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,779
to be able to do that we of course need

788
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,899
to find some doq capable resolvers we

789
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,059
found about a thousand two hundred very

790
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,399
interesting thing to me not all of them

791
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,940
supported even do UDP so if we filter

792
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,679
out only the ones that do all the

793
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,320
different DNS flavors that we wanted to

794
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,960
test which were five uh we end up with

795
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,840
only 313. so that that's what we tested

796
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,820
most of them are in Europe and in Asia

797
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,039
as you can see on the map we then have

798
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,140
six different Vantage points on Amazon

799
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,179
for which we executed by performance

800
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:54,120
measurements next slide please

801
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,580
for that we automate chromium with

802
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,100
selenium framework we test only the 10

803
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,260
most popular web pages going to the

804
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,020
Tranquil list because chromium also

805
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,700
doesn't do all the flavors we want it or

806
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,380
had a configurable option for all of

807
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,200
them we run a local DNS proxy next to

808
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,600
the chromium instances that can then

809
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,039
talk the different flavors to the actual

810
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:20,120
resolvers next slide please

811
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,260
um so basically for each of the web page

812
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,019
we run a new test for all of the

813
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:26,580
different things that we can test the

814
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,919
protocols the results Finance points we

815
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,380
do that about four times spread across

816
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,320
one week in April this year

817
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,820
interestingly we do two independent

818
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,159
measurements the first one is to do some

819
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,080
bootstrapping and the second one is the

820
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,360
actual web performance measurements the

821
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,940
bootstrapping step is mainly to populate

822
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,940
the DNS cache not the web browser cache

823
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,440
of course that would heavily impact the

824
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,240
measurements only the DNS resolver cache

825
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,100
should open beyond have a recursive

826
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,779
resolution

827
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,059
impact there but we also store things

828
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,039
like the actual quick version that is in

829
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,799
news uh address validation tokens which

830
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,360
is very crucial because for some reason

831
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,940
all of the doq service we found have

832
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,460
retry always on if you don't know what

833
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,839
that means that it basically incurs a

834
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,540
one rtt delay for every single quick

835
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,060
connection setup which we don't want but

836
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,679
that's bypass by

837
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,020
address validation and session

838
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,599
resumption so we also use the the

839
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,239
bootstrapping step to store the TLs 1.3

840
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,679
session tickets both for Doh and doq so

841
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,659
the measurements are really like the

842
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,699
best possible that we could do in terms

843
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,780
of performance

844
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,280
um at this point next slide please

845
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,780
from that we get a respectable number of

846
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,179
samples I would say very interestingly

847
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,460
all of the quick servers do support TLS

848
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,260
session resumption which is very good

849
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,800
and none of them supports hero OT which

850
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,080
is absolutely terrible because that

851
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,040
again

852
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,699
incurs at least a one rtt uh delay for

853
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,400
all of the handshakes that we can do

854
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,660
interestingly also not all of them were

855
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,460
fully up to date neither with the latest

856
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,400
quick version more latest DNS over quick

857
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,440
version so it's

858
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,599
to me it seems like not all the reserves

859
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,000
are production level quality yet

860
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,099
next slide please

861
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,619
we see summer things for DNS over HTTP

862
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:19,020
2. good support for session resumption

863
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,619
great no zero rtt terrible no TCP fast

864
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:23,579
open

865
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,619
somewhat interesting to some people

866
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:26,720
maybe

867
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,880
next slide please

868
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,400
all right for the web performance

869
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,440
specifically we look at two different

870
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,380
metrics first is called first contentful

871
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,079
paint that's kind of like the first big

872
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,119
thing or interesting thing that is shown

873
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,220
on the screen if you're loading a web

874
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,020
page this happens relatively early in

875
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,460
the web page load and so it should

876
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,579
correlate relatively well with the DNS

877
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:53,520
times as we'll see and then we have one

878
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,619
very late in the web page load when

879
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:56,760
everything is almost completely done

880
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,040
it's based a lot of time which should

881
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,440
have less of a correlation because a lot

882
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,500
extra stuff is going on there as well

883
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,300
next slide please

884
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,619
so let's first look at the First Column

885
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,619
full paint here we have the Baseline

886
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,240
here at zero percent vertical line

887
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,900
that's do UDP so the DNS we all know and

888
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,200
love and then the blue is the DNS over

889
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,400
quick and the green is DNS over http

890
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,400
what we can see is that about 40 40th

891
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,680
percentile yeah

892
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,079
um doq is about 10 slower

893
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,060
the normal do UDP and Doh is about 20

894
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,740
slower right so it's not a terrible

895
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,079
difference for this metric but the oh is

896
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,599
about twice as slow as doq for this

897
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,700
metric and this trend holds next slide

898
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,180
even as we move up to the 88 percentile

899
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,060
um there although the uq obviously

900
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,420
becomes slower than your do

901
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,720
UDP Baseline there as well but still 20

902
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,480
I think should be relatively acceptable

903
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,640
uh in some cases

904
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,380
um next slide

905
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,640
so the conclusion we have in the paper

906
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,700
is a doq indeed significantly improves

907
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,200
over the oh

908
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,780
at least for this metric next slide

909
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,440
please

910
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,000
so let's look at a second metric then we

911
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,220
have the total page for the time per web

912
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,359
page

913
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,420
um

914
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,119
as I said we do 10 different

915
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,579
sites we only show four here those are

916
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,740
four columns and then the four rows are

917
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,660
the different uh continents that we have

918
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,400
the resolvers

919
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,619
um this image is much bigger in the

920
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,140
paper for more context but this kind of

921
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,880
highlights what we do

922
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,720
um

923
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,460
we split this up we'll split this up in

924
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,320
two parts on the left we have relatively

925
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,540
simple web pages that only do a single

926
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,900
DNS resolution per load and then on the

927
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,820
right we have a bit more complex web

928
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,640
pages that do eight or nine DNS

929
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,859
resolutions

930
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,880
until they're loaded interestingly for

931
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,160
reasons this has a different Baseline

932
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,960
than previous graphs so here the

933
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,180
Baseline is not the audb here the

934
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,099
Baseline is deal quick

935
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,780
so the vertical line in the middle is

936
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,119
always quick and then the purple usually

937
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,900
on the left is udb usually faster and

938
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,260
the green is still Doh usually slower

939
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,720
than uh than the quick all right next

940
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,140
slide please

941
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,060
so let's look at the on the left side

942
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,980
relatively simple web pages which is we

943
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,859
want to look up at the median we find

944
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:35,339
that as you might expect doq is just

945
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,380
like for First Column for paint it still

946
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,480
holds for this metric uq is about 10

947
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,220
faster than

948
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,540
do HTTP but it's also still 10 slower

949
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,380
than

950
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,200
pure do UDP without a connection setup

951
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,800
right so you could say

952
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,780
one back sorry

953
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,720
it's not really fair so you could see it

954
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,880
here that the cost of your encrypted

955
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,820
transport is relatively high up to 10 at

956
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,599
least for the IQ and up to 20 for Doh

957
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,359
for the entire page load that's uh

958
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,060
interesting next slide

959
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,980
if we look at the

960
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,380
more complex Pages we do see some

961
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,900
different things going on things get

962
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,180
much much closer together visually there

963
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,000
at the median for some of these uh there

964
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,220
is even just a two percent difference

965
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,920
between the do UDP and the do quick

966
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,680
setup without zero rtt

967
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,500
very important so that's that was a

968
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,300
surprising result to me

969
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,420
um what the team found was that this uh

970
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,760
relatively simple explanation

971
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,980
um because you only have to do the

972
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,020
connection setup once and then you can

973
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,520
just reuse the connection for the eight

974
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,200
or nine different lookups that you have

975
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,820
to do so you basically just paid over at

976
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,800
once it has a heavy impact for the

977
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,380
simple pages but a much smaller impact

978
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,839
for the more complex Pages because DNS

979
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,180
lookups can happen in parallel to other

980
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,220
resources that are being downloaded and

981
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,839
you don't have to wait for things to go

982
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,460
on so that's what you clearly see in

983
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,440
this more complex or later page flow

984
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,720
time metric

985
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,240
and there and

986
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,920
so it kind of depends on the type of

987
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,660
website that you have

988
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,920
um the exact impact that you might

989
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,160
expect next slide please

990
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,440
um that was the conclusion I just gave

991
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,079
next slide please

992
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,480
right so the conclusion uh is that

993
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,000
indeed it seems that doq has quite a bit

994
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,579
of promise to improve the potential

995
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,619
performance impact we go from about

996
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:38,339
let's say 20 on most pages to half of

997
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:40,980
that which I think is a nice game

998
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,060
um

999
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,160
and it helps

1000
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,200
it uh it's it's even better for more

1001
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,540
complex web pages to do a lot of a lot

1002
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,119
of lookups which I guess is

1003
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,460
in many cases most of them there's a big

1004
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,859
caveat of course we only tested 10 web

1005
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:58,200
pages we only tested 300 resolvers we're

1006
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,760
very aware of that we're trying to scale

1007
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,859
up our deployment and get a bit more

1008
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,839
insight into what these different

1009
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,520
resolvers are

1010
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,560
um but we're not there yet

1011
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,060
that leads me to the last thing the

1012
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,099
future work of course besides that

1013
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,320
increasing the scale there's of course a

1014
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,300
big opportunity for zero rtt which

1015
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,280
should bring doq even much much closer

1016
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,740
to the UDP

1017
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,180
um of course

1018
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,420
should have only benefits I assume at

1019
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,099
least if we can get it secure and then

1020
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,220
of course when I said Doh we only tested

1021
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,680
Duo over http 2.

1022
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,540
recently while we were working on the

1023
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,260
paper DNS over HTTP 3 was also supported

1024
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,780
by quite some big deployments According

1025
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,060
to some blog posts and so that's also

1026
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,680
something to look forward to in the

1027
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,480
future I don't think that will have a

1028
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,599
huge impact

1029
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,920
by itself I think the impact is mostly

1030
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,260
on the quick layer there as well but we

1031
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,280
will see

1032
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,740
all right next slide

1033
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,200
you can find some additional uh stuff

1034
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,339
there and before we go to questions

1035
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:02,060
lasting

1036
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,839
those of you who are in a quick working

1037
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,760
group earlier saw that I brought some

1038
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,920
Belgian chocolate there were very few

1039
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,480
people who took me up on that Source

1040
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,760
plenty left and actually I have to leave

1041
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,140
right after this meeting I have to go

1042
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,480
catch train back to Belgium and I refuse

1043
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,640
to take Belgian chocolate back to

1044
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,040
Belgium I will not do it so I will leave

1045
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,740
it here with Miriam and whatever is left

1046
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,359
after Miriam's done with it please

1047
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,220
come up to uh thanks Robin uh we got

1048
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,960
four people in the queue and uh we got

1049
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,820
about well four or five minutes to deal

1050
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,740
with that so why did why don't you go

1051
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,839
Lorenzo

1052
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:43,079
super interesting thank you um thank you

1053
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,820
also for noticing the Android

1054
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,700
implementation uh so I have a few

1055
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,380
questions first of all just clarifying

1056
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,000
like these resolver they're just like

1057
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,680
random ones that you found is that right

1058
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,839
okay so like who knows what they are

1059
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:58,800
what they do okay exactly okay

1060
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,619
um second question did you graph DNS

1061
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,720
response times as well or just stick

1062
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,819
page those no no so the first part of

1063
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,680
the paper is pure the DNS performance

1064
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,740
and and I would expect zero X if you go

1065
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,660
two slides further right two or three

1066
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,079
slides I would expect zero X Change for

1067
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,300
the subsequent queries and 2x penalty

1068
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,760
for the first query one more

1069
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,020
and did you you did not find that at all

1070
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,200
like Doh sorry doq versus

1071
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,180
um

1072
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,520
right yeah this is about twice as fast

1073
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,319
as uh wait so these are royal

1074
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,819
milliseconds or they are it's a roll

1075
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:37,319
milliseconds ah but you need the

1076
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:38,579
percentage Improvement to figure out

1077
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:39,839
yeah because I would expect the first

1078
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,760
query to be the same that 2x the cost

1079
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,099
and the second queries to be like yeah

1080
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,720
but we we only looked at the first

1081
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,140
queries

1082
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:51,660
I know you said you had a couple

1083
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,339
questions but let's let's let these

1084
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,560
other folks uh get in there the other

1085
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,660
one was like please do measure in the

1086
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,060
future dohd versus doq because

1087
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,579
implementations are listening to you

1088
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:05,220
uh yes absolutely

1089
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,419
uh Tommy can you go

1090
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,119
yep I can um yeah so thanks for this

1091
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,099
um so first I'm just gonna comment it's

1092
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,839
quite concerning that we're seeing

1093
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,359
deployments of doq servers that are

1094
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:20,160
configured so badly for the fast

1095
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,319
connection setup right so like sending a

1096
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,380
retry is crazy for this and also the

1097
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,280
fact that they're doing session

1098
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,400
resumption without doing zero rtt is

1099
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,020
very bad right because like that doesn't

1100
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,900
help the client number of round trips it

1101
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,520
just creates linkability

1102
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,740
so like it's a tracking Vector but it

1103
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,980
doesn't help you on performance so

1104
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,060
kind of worrying that because more books

1105
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,160
on that uh Paulie in the paper told me

1106
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,280
yeah but yeah it's it's it was confusing

1107
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,079
that's why I also think that these are

1108
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,060
not production level things yeah just

1109
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,220
tests right which also makes me

1110
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,500
concerned about some of the measurements

1111
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,240
um and then if we are doing more

1112
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,520
measurements I really want to emphasize

1113
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,500
what Lorenzo was saying that like we

1114
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,520
should be comparing doq and doh3

1115
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,940
um the thing I I love Doh I think it's

1116
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,579
the right answer actually not doq

1117
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:18,480
because it can run over TCP or quick and

1118
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,060
I'm I'm skeptical that doq should be any

1119
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,819
better than doh3

1120
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:25,680
um and the nice thing about Doh is it

1121
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,900
works if quick is blocked or not

1122
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,900
so let's make sure that we are letting

1123
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,000
Doh have a competitive

1124
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,579
uh comparison here and not just compare

1125
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,520
it against an H2 stack that's probably a

1126
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,800
not very good H2 stack let's compare it

1127
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,040
against a production level H3 stack yeah

1128
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,960
I think completely agree right thanks

1129
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,359
thanks Tammy

1130
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:51,420
um Siobhan can you call hello uh shivans

1131
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,400
I have Brave browser just wondering when

1132
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,260
you maybe you already mentioned this but

1133
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,880
um when you say complexity of web pages

1134
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,560
how are you defining that oh yeah it's

1135
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,960
purely the amount of resolvers it's not

1136
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,000
the size or the amount of resources it's

1137
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,800
the amount of queries storing it not the

1138
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,880
amount of resolvers the amount of

1139
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,040
domains that you have to look up guys

1140
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,960
because I would imagine like first party

1141
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,180
first party was third party versus CDA

1142
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,099
and all of that yeah exactly all of that

1143
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:17,339
plays into it but we didn't it kind of

1144
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:18,660
is impacted by the page load time

1145
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,579
eventual metrics right but we didn't

1146
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:23,599
really split it out yet

1147
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:29,520
um I the point on the slide here that

1148
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,200
encrypted DNS does not have to be a

1149
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,599
compromise to me it looked like the data

1150
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,880
showed there is a slight compromise and

1151
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,060
it can get smaller is that I I would

1152
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,460
agree with that uh yes but it's not like

1153
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,440
you really have to make a choice you can

1154
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,359
take a small performance hit

1155
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,980
let's get the other thing there it's

1156
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,660
still a compromise but it's much less

1157
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,579
big I would say than with the previous

1158
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,180
encrypted DNS yes yeah and so I I agree

1159
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,819
for a user you can take that decision if

1160
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:57,839
you're a network that's being

1161
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,520
benchmarked in terms of your response

1162
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,200
time against your peers

1163
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,000
would you want to put

1164
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,300
add additional delay in so I

1165
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,220
would the authors going to follow up

1166
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,480
with

1167
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,000
um http 3.

1168
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,500
as it says here that is actually

1169
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,020
actively ongoing work perfect trying to

1170
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,460
do that great thank you

1171
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:21,780
okay thanks so much do more work and

1172
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,000
come back

1173
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,760
all right don't forget the chocolate yes

1174
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,800
all right and I apologize for having to

1175
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,900
laugh I apologize for having to lock the

1176
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,700
queue but we're really tight on time for

1177
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,680
so let's get Francois

1178
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,779
are you you should be here

1179
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,599
oh one final

1180
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,180
uh thing on that last one

1181
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,040
and there's someone in the chat asking

1182
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,180
for the link to the paper

1183
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,940
um I believe there's a link to the paper

1184
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,460
in our gender

1185
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,200
but otherwise just use the mailing list

1186
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,119
to approach the authors or approach the

1187
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,099
authors directly

1188
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:10,740
I don't see your question do you

1189
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,000
did you request you

1190
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,220
ah okay then I'll do it for you

1191
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,000
okay

1192
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
yeah

1193
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,260
sure

1194
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,079
okay

1195
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,200
so hello everyone my name is Francois I

1196
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,619
work at UC luva and actually that's a

1197
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:06,900
work that has been done in collaboration

1198
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,060
with people from Polytechnic auditorino

1199
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,359
with Martino travisan Daniel Giordano

1200
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:15,619
and my advisor

1201
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,440
and this paper was presented at IMC 2022

1202
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,660
so sorry for the folks that already saw

1203
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,880
that presentation

1204
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,200
so

1205
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,240
um quick reminder for those who don't

1206
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,640
know stalling stalling aims at providing

1207
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,400
internet access to distant and rural

1208
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,319
areas by deploying satellite

1209
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,000
constellations a bit everywhere in the

1210
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,640
world with low earth orbit meaning that

1211
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,220
the satellites are at a low height

1212
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,040
basically perhaps

1213
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,380
so um in the lab we are more interested

1214
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,660
in transport protocol and performances

1215
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,180
and so we order the starlink access to

1216
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,740
do experiments

1217
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,560
with our quick and FEC stuff

1218
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,380
so at the beginning the the objective

1219
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,599
was not to do a styling performance

1220
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,520
evaluation but at the end we saw that

1221
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,579
there were no not much public data that

1222
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,619
were released so we decided to do some

1223
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:10,560
benchmarkings of our styling access so

1224
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,780
we ordered the standard static access we

1225
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,020
put up we put up

1226
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,819
the the dish on the top of our building

1227
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,200
in Belgium

1228
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,420
so not that far away from London

1229
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,460
actually

1230
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:26,760
and we did several performance analysis

1231
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,000
so first we did an analysis at a at a

1232
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,099
high level we wanted to know how

1233
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:34,260
Sterling performs compared to a

1234
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,140
classical ethernet access and to a

1235
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,819
traditional satcom access which is

1236
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,160
geostationary meaning that the delay is

1237
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,839
a lot higher

1238
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:46,140
but the bandwidth can be really high

1239
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,599
so we did a small performance analysis

1240
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:51,420
using browser time looking at the page

1241
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,059
load time basically so on this graph on

1242
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,740
the x-axis you have

1243
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,619
uh the the time needed to load the web

1244
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:02,339
page and the curves are a CDF so

1245
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:04,859
cumulative distributed function

1246
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:06,900
and so let's do first a little guessing

1247
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,359
game uh what's your opinion where should

1248
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,339
I place installing so I'll let you think

1249
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,500
a bit in your head

1250
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,780
and so I'll give you the answer so

1251
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,000
starlink

1252
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,160
performed basically quite close to the

1253
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,180
fast internet access so who had it right

1254
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,819
okay so not many of you so I think there

1255
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:29,760
is enough chocolate for you

1256
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,160
so I'm stealing Robin's chocolate sorry

1257
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,380
for that

1258
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,780
so okay so starlink is performing quite

1259
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,180
close to the fussy tender access so we

1260
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,460
decided to do more more measurements to

1261
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,900
understand why

1262
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,559
so first uh here is the outline that we

1263
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,839
of the experiments we did so we did some

1264
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:52,800
latency analysis latency under load and

1265
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,660
we also studied the packet losses

1266
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,599
especially packets drop rate and packet

1267
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,700
loss bursts because plus this can occur

1268
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,859
in bursts

1269
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:04,619
so first we did a simple ping campaign

1270
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,160
we had a lot of anchors around the world

1271
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,220
but here we will focus on the anchors in

1272
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,059
Europe to limit or or study to the

1273
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:17,760
satellite link as close as possible we

1274
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,200
have two anchors in the Netherlands two

1275
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,940
anchors in Germany and foreign cars in

1276
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,400
Belgium why did we choose Netherlands

1277
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,380
and Germany especially because we had

1278
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,660
two Starling exits when we did Trace

1279
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,640
roads one in Germany and one in the

1280
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,099
Netherlands so that's why we chose the

1281
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:33,900
Netherlands and Germany

1282
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,000
so here is a graph showing the results

1283
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,400
of all pinks as you can see there is a

1284
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,220
blue line around 20 milliseconds this is

1285
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,920
the latency announced by starlink and

1286
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,660
basically this is the minimum latency

1287
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,400
that we could achieve so we could

1288
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,160
achieve what was advertised but on the

1289
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,140
median it was more around 50

1290
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,700
milliseconds

1291
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,260
also we saw a small decrease

1292
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,960
here and a small bump at the end so we

1293
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,579
search a bit because we were thinking

1294
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,260
about new satellites being released for

1295
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,140
example because there are

1296
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,460
constantly releasing new satellites at

1297
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,260
lower orbits and that kind of stuff but

1298
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,839
we didn't see any real correlation

1299
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:16,980
between this variation and there is the

1300
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,720
satellites that were launched

1301
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,300
so we just have to expect that the

1302
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,460
latency may vary during long periods

1303
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,660
basically

1304
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,880
and what we can conclude here is that we

1305
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,680
can reach what's advertised by stalling

1306
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,740
but at the minimum because on media and

1307
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,839
it was more 50 milliseconds on an idling

1308
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,640
idle link

1309
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,520
but here it was only on an idle link so

1310
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,500
what happens when we put load on the

1311
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,480
link we could expect to see buffer bloat

1312
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,559
I guess

1313
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:47,040
so let's see we did a quick transfers

1314
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,859
HTTP tree transfer actually

1315
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:53,280
and with quick what's easy is as you

1316
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,800
have explicit packet numbers that are

1317
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,300
continuously

1318
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,599
um increased you can find the RTD of

1319
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:04,319
every uh largest acknowledged packet

1320
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,079
and so we did this HTTP three transfers

1321
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,300
download and upload and we reported the

1322
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,940
distribution of the rtt of every

1323
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,099
acknowledged packet

1324
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:16,559
and we plotted it on the graph

1325
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,740
the green line is the median ping

1326
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,540
latency of the graph before so around 50

1327
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,280
milliseconds and we saw that there was

1328
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,140
quite a lot of buffer bloat probably at

1329
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,300
the user equipment but we cannot be

1330
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,940
totally sure what we can be sure of is

1331
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,319
that there is no pep because quick

1332
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:34,920
ensures that there is no pep between the

1333
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,359
end points

1334
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,760
so this this is with a heavy load with

1335
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,619
HTTP 3 downloads

1336
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:43,079
so we decided to do uh the same

1337
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,000
measurements with light loads basically

1338
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,040
we were simulating a video configuration

1339
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,079
use case we sent 25 message per second

1340
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:53,520
at 3 Mbps which is a lot lower that than

1341
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,800
the throughput that we can achieve with

1342
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,880
starlink

1343
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,740
and what we saw with that video

1344
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,440
conferencing use case uh is that the

1345
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,900
median pin latency for download was

1346
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,440
exactly the same as the Ping latency so

1347
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,420
there's a question so I'm gonna answer

1348
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,859
it right now if needed

1349
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,660
we can take it later let's take it at

1350
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,640
the end okay okay let's take it at the

1351
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,960
end

1352
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,300
so yeah here the graph shows the

1353
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,220
difference in latency uh between light

1354
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,800
load and heavy load so we could see some

1355
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,780
buffer blood it's not really specific to

1356
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,260
styling but it's related to how the CPU

1357
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:35,240
handles the the buffer basically

1358
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,260
so this was about the latency let's look

1359
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,720
at the packet loss rates because it's a

1360
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,819
wireless link at some point so there

1361
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:43,440
might be losses especially that the

1362
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,940
satellites are moving and the antenna is

1363
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,460
moving too so it could lose the focus

1364
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:51,059
so we studied the loss rates under the

1365
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,619
heavy load where you could have

1366
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:54,240
congestion because we saw that there was

1367
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,700
some buffer bloat and we also studied

1368
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,460
the loss rates with the light load use

1369
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,680
case where we should expect that the

1370
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,680
congestion loss should be rare or

1371
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,940
non-existent

1372
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:11,040
and what we saw is that with the H3 bulk

1373
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,319
download we apparently have

1374
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:16,140
congestion-induced glasses quite a lot

1375
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,760
of them actually

1376
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,380
and it's easy to measure with quick

1377
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,300
compared to DCP

1378
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,839
and um with the light load use case with

1379
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,160
the message use case where the

1380
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,040
congestion should not be to present uh

1381
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,780
the network the network is not last free

1382
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,819
and we compared it with our wired access

1383
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:34,559
and we had basically no loss with the

1384
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,180
message use case so we might expect that

1385
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,640
it might be due to the satellite loss of

1386
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,559
focus

1387
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,680
so this is the aggregated loss rate but

1388
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,900
with quick what is quite easy to do is

1389
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,839
to study the loss bursts because you can

1390
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:50,640
see the the packets that that are

1391
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,859
consecutively lost

1392
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:55,680
so that's what we did so

1393
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,140
um on the left you have the loss bursts

1394
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:01,319
distribution for or HTTP HTTP 3 transfer

1395
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:02,940
and on the right you have the

1396
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,160
distribution of the Lost bursts for our

1397
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,440
message light load transfer

1398
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,099
and so what we can see is that even if

1399
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:14,880
um with the heavy load you have a high

1400
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,619
loss rate of nearly two percent of

1401
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:19,200
losses the loss bursts are in proportion

1402
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,059
quite small

1403
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:23,960
but if you do the the light load

1404
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,579
transfer the loss rate is quite small

1405
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:28,980
but the loss bursts are really longer

1406
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,260
and so that may be due to the fact that

1407
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,819
the antenna is losing focus at some

1408
00:57:32,819 --> 00:57:34,319
point and so there isn't another

1409
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,599
stunning paper that also studies that

1410
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:39,300
that so that depending on the satellite

1411
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,540
position uh when the satellite is is far

1412
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,000
away the losses are getting more and

1413
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,640
more frequent and the and more long

1414
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,319
basically so you could you could see

1415
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:51,720
quite long lost bursts with stalling

1416
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,940
even without pressure on the link

1417
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,559
so this is the part of the reason that

1418
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,740
we saw in our paper we have others so I

1419
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,660
didn't talk about true boot install

1420
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,099
because there are other metrics to look

1421
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,140
at but you have throughput measurements

1422
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,359
in the in the paper we search for some

1423
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:10,140
peps with TCP we search on middlebox and

1424
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,040
we did other other measurements uh with

1425
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,079
the with the browsers and stuff so don't

1426
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,700
hesitate to have a look at the paper for

1427
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,740
that

1428
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,380
and so we can conclude so Australian

1429
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,420
equipment at a high level it could

1430
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,760
compete with our wire access it had

1431
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,859
similar performances with or wired

1432
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:30,900
access and the mini the added latency

1433
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,940
was only of 20 milliseconds which which

1434
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,099
is quite low

1435
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:38,579
we so buffer bloat uh probably a DCP but

1436
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:40,559
we don't we don't really know

1437
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,260
we saw that the quick RTD can can more

1438
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,440
than double which can can have a high

1439
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,180
impact on the latency of your

1440
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,280
applications especially if there are

1441
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,079
latency sensitive

1442
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,960
and we saw that even under a really

1443
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,619
light load losses can still be present

1444
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:02,280
and they can span over dozens of packets

1445
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,559
finally one thing that we would like to

1446
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,780
say is that quick helped us quite a lot

1447
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,180
to do measurements because of the packet

1448
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,559
number thing so it might be interesting

1449
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,240
to push the measures the measurement

1450
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,040
with quick and this is what we started

1451
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,380
during the hackathon by pushing quick to

1452
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,559
NDT and so if you want to help us

1453
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:22,140
pushing measurements with quick let us

1454
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,880
know

1455
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,339
so yeah one limitation is that we only

1456
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:28,200
had a single vantage point in Belgium so

1457
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,619
we basically were only studying our

1458
00:59:30,619 --> 00:59:33,780
starlink access so our part of our

1459
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,339
future work is to collaborate with

1460
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:37,980
researchers to do multi-vantage Point

1461
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:41,579
studies and inter-satellite Link studies

1462
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,559
so that's it if you want to collaborate

1463
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:46,500
with us uh if you have any satellite

1464
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,500
access to to collaborate with us let us

1465
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,720
know if you have a Geo satellite access

1466
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,400
let us know too because we would like to

1467
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,700
Benchmark especially our quick NFC stuff

1468
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,339
so don't hesitate to contact us and

1469
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:01,680
finally all of our data set is publicly

1470
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,260
available all of of our pcapps it's more

1471
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,839
than 500 gigabytes of quick download

1472
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:08,700
basically over starlink everything is

1473
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,559
available

1474
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:11,819
publicly so don't hesitate to download

1475
01:00:11,819 --> 01:00:13,799
it so thank you

1476
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:15,599
thanks Francois um we've already got

1477
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,160
three people on the Queue and you

1478
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,660
finished a little bit early so we get to

1479
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,059
hear from them so Jeff you're up first

1480
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,799
hi Jeff Houston

1481
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,180
um we did a very similar measurement

1482
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,220
back in March with both geostationary

1483
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,559
and starlink

1484
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,579
um and the first thing I want to

1485
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:32,339
actually comment on is your latency

1486
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:33,599
measurement if you want to go back to

1487
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,040
that slide

1488
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,839
um if you do the maths

1489
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:40,920
the satellites at 550 kilometers up but

1490
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,040
when it's on the horizon it's

1491
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,020
2704 kilometers away yeah you know out

1492
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,599
there and what that means is that the

1493
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:51,359
rtt variation now the one on time series

1494
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:55,260
The Raw rtt should change between 1.8

1495
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,079
milliseconds sorry 7.3 milliseconds and

1496
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,579
36.

1497
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:01,859
and it's moving one degree of Arc per

1498
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:02,880
second

1499
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,940
so you should see much more variance in

1500
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:09,000
the minimum rtt but you don't and

1501
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,880
neither did I so what this means is the

1502
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,680
rtt you're singing

1503
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,099
is actually an induction coming from

1504
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:21,000
either on the client side or on the

1505
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,940
earth station side that is effectively

1506
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,280
compensating for the delay in the

1507
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,579
spacecraft from Horizon to apogee or

1508
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:31,319
whatever it's called and also the

1509
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:34,319
switching delay you don't see any of it

1510
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,020
so that actually has a big impact on the

1511
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,900
protocol performance right and so the

1512
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,400
next question is

1513
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,220
did you look at bbr

1514
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,079
so basically we didn't look at bbr

1515
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,119
because we we used

1516
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:49,920
um the quiche implementation and by the

1517
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,680
time it didn't have vbr now it has it so

1518
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,260
I was able to rip 300 megabits per

1519
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,260
second out of this circuit on bbr

1520
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,720
on the same system I was only getting 60

1521
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,839
out of cubic okay so bbr has a

1522
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:05,579
remarkably different performance

1523
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:08,280
protocol on starlink that kind of says

1524
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,220
use me ignore everything else versus

1525
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,319
cubic that kind of goes it runs more

1526
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:14,579
like a dog

1527
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:16,440
but the interesting fact from all of

1528
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:21,119
these protocols is that the the tied rtt

1529
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,160
actually makes most of these protocols

1530
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,079
work much better than they would if you

1531
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:27,420
were given the raw rtt of actually the

1532
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,740
satellite

1533
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,940
thank you for the insights and uh yes we

1534
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,520
had some throughput measurements with um

1535
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,240
with the kitchen cubic and basically we

1536
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,099
couldn't reach the same throughput as

1537
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:44,760
TCP was reaching uh basically we had the

1538
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,380
same finding of field we had more than

1539
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:49,980
100 100 megabytes but not much more

1540
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,040
compared to TCP so yeah we have to say

1541
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,780
go ahead man

1542
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,900
Taurus meta um I was curious with the

1543
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,180
loss where was that accounting for

1544
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,220
various losses too or is that just

1545
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,260
losses reported by the quick stack or

1546
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,720
were you doing that based on the pcaps

1547
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,640
and the actual packets lost

1548
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,700
so it was a real loss so we did uh

1549
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,680
packet captures and so these packets

1550
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,540
were never acknowledged at any point so

1551
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,520
I guess it's not super use yeah that's

1552
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,559
useful to know because one thing that

1553
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:21,660
I've noticed on starlink is that the

1554
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,599
most implementations will detect very

1555
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:27,480
high higher loss rates than are actually

1556
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,579
happening mostly do this various losses

1557
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:32,280
because of constellation and reordering

1558
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,799
so yeah we also saw weird stuff at some

1559
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:35,700
point

1560
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,099
um with the first few handshake packets

1561
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:40,980
being lost nearly systematically at some

1562
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,619
point and then it disappeared so we had

1563
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,299
some weird kind of traffic patterns at

1564
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:48,380
some point so yeah

1565
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,380
all right let's wrap it up with gory

1566
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,960
so Gary first long time lover of

1567
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,180
satellites as well as the internet

1568
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,460
well that's interesting thank you ever

1569
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,839
so much

1570
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:03,599
um one thing I didn't like in your talk

1571
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,940
is I think you have to be very very

1572
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,500
specific about when the data was

1573
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,480
measured and where it was measured

1574
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,280
because this constellation is changing

1575
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,720
people are launching new stuffs and

1576
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,980
they're also changing I think what

1577
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,359
they're doing internally without telling

1578
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,799
anyone so

1579
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,780
we may have to make sure that we tag our

1580
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,240
data with the right things having said

1581
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,220
that yeah your lost stuff matches

1582
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,680
exactly what I've seen using ipof yeah

1583
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,180
there's lots of losses going on here

1584
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,099
it's not within quick at all quick can't

1585
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,480
be blamed it's

1586
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,099
something that styling could deliver and

1587
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:33,480
goes they seem to be fixing the rtt

1588
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,640
thing yeah Jeff's probably saying

1589
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,780
something really interesting here we

1590
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,520
should work that one out but they are

1591
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,020
still leaving as lots of losses which

1592
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,240
may not be the right thing

1593
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,160
we have a satellite link we will play

1594
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,400
please contact us and yeah please carry

1595
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,980
around doing this this is really good

1596
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,500
these strange bumps in height yeah

1597
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,420
probably should look at those yeah sure

1598
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,000
I think these are not particularly big

1599
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,400
from the point of view of Quake but we

1600
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,640
saw some enormous spikes which could

1601
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,980
actually be quite important if you drill

1602
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,079
right in on a fine time scale

1603
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:09,059
so let's look also at individual

1604
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:10,380
accounts did you see it do any

1605
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,000
measurements of individual quick packets

1606
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,040
and how long they took look let's cool

1607
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,359
we're gonna have to we're gonna have to

1608
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:16,319
stop now

1609
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,960
um thanks Corey

1610
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,940
yeah I apologize for having to cut it

1611
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,799
but we're just enough time to finish by

1612
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,200
the end of the year

1613
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,420
yeah

1614
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,500
we did it but yeah we can take it

1615
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,260
offline

1616
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,760
but even better let's do it let's do it

1617
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,079
offline and then tell us what we think

1618
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,000
yeah but we did it basically yeah

1619
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,380
okay guys can you see and hear me

1620
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,359
yes but I don't ship shop like chocolate

1621
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,078
to you right

1622
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:55,440
all right

1623
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,900
thank you

1624
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,839
okay so I probably just get started you

1625
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:02,339
guys can all see and hear me see the

1626
01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:04,200
slides or tape if you want to I don't

1627
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,260
see the slides do you see the slides

1628
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,480
I'm hitting Grand to pre-loaded slides

1629
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,760
for Philip and we have the slides up you

1630
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,740
can't see them oh I just have the wrong

1631
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,180
there we go

1632
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,859
all right Phillip you've got 15 minutes

1633
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:20,460
okay thanks so yeah hi uh I'm Philip I'm

1634
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,859
I'm with Akamai uh this is joined work

1635
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:25,799
with Oliver and Arthur who are with Max

1636
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:28,500
Planck Institute and akamind MIT

1637
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,740
respectively and so this this talk is

1638
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,980
about detecting who is scanning um who

1639
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:37,140
is scanning in the Indie IPv6 space and

1640
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,339
I want to start off with a quick

1641
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:40,799
refresher on what we actually mean when

1642
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,720
we talk about scanning

1643
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,460
um so scanning means that we have a we

1644
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:46,500
have a scan source and the scan Source

1645
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,200
sends probing packets Two Hosts on the

1646
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,260
internet to test whether the hosts run a

1647
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,819
specific service that the scanner is

1648
01:06:53,819 --> 01:06:55,380
interested in like in this case we have

1649
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,539
a scanner that's interested in finding

1650
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:00,119
hosts that run telnet which is a

1651
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:01,680
protocol known to be frequently

1652
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,780
frequently abused and the scanner

1653
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,059
doesn't just send a single packet but it

1654
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:07,740
sends packets to as many hosts as

1655
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:09,599
possible and that's why it's why it's

1656
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,180
called scanning right and when doing

1657
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,140
this

1658
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,059
um eventually a host will get back to

1659
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:18,000
the scanner in this case I would have

1660
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,220
TCP synac and what what typically

1661
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,619
happens next is that the scanner or some

1662
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:25,440
entity associated with a scanner does

1663
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,119
something malicious and that can either

1664
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,819
be attempts to to exploit known

1665
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:32,280
vulnerabilities in the targeted host or

1666
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,160
to abuse the target host in subsequent

1667
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,200
amplification attacks or they're kind of

1668
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,299
you know many many scenarios possible so

1669
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:41,400
what's clear is that for a lot of the

1670
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,319
cyber attacks that we that we see and

1671
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:44,760
that we're dealing with scanning

1672
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,380
scanning is a key component that's

1673
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,660
required to actually enable to enable

1674
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,500
them

1675
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,319
and now most of what you what you read

1676
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,000
and hear about scanning concerns

1677
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,299
scanning in the in the ipv4 space and I

1678
01:07:57,299 --> 01:07:59,280
want to quickly start by talking about

1679
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,160
what scanning on the V4 space means now

1680
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,839
um as we all know the V4 space is

1681
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,640
comparably small we have about four

1682
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,280
billion Target addresses and about like

1683
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,260
three billion of them are routable and

1684
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,900
you can relatively easily scan the

1685
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,420
entire ipv4 space in less than less than

1686
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,040
one hour

1687
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,839
um so this is kind of the scanning part

1688
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:21,299
which is relatively easy to conduct also

1689
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:23,698
when it comes to detecting who is

1690
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:25,979
scanning and what are what are people

1691
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:28,799
scanning for in the ipv4 space Also that

1692
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,140
is readily doable by relying on dark

1693
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,719
Nets or network telescopes

1694
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:35,339
um there are some limitations to doing

1695
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:37,439
that but overall if you want to get a

1696
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,600
sense of how much scanning is happening

1697
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,080
in the ipv4 space that's readily readily

1698
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,120
doable and actually there's a lot of

1699
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,759
that happening so what we see in the V4

1700
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,859
space we have millions of monthly active

1701
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,719
scanning sources and that's mainly also

1702
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:54,120
driven by several botnets just scanning

1703
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,160
randomly through the through the ipv4

1704
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,238
space

1705
01:08:57,238 --> 01:09:00,299
okay now if you look at IPv6

1706
01:09:00,299 --> 01:09:02,819
um things just get vastly more

1707
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:04,620
complicated we have about 10 to the

1708
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,679
power of 38 Target addresses and a full

1709
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,719
scan is simply impossible it would take

1710
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:12,839
trillions of trillions of years and what

1711
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:15,060
that means is that scanners whoever

1712
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,100
wants to scan the IPv6 space they need

1713
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,799
to they need to rely on hit lists or on

1714
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:21,600
other mechanisms to really like direct

1715
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,698
their scanning traffic at very specific

1716
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:26,399
very specific targets as opposed to just

1717
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,819
randomly generating addresses and this

1718
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:33,060
need for directing scan traffic at

1719
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,160
various specific destinations also makes

1720
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,779
the detection

1721
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:38,339
um the detection of such scanning

1722
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:40,679
activity much more difficult because in

1723
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:43,198
the V6 space we now need a vantage point

1724
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,660
that actually attracts attracts scanning

1725
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:47,759
traffic itself so that we can then look

1726
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,960
at the data and study it and so perhaps

1727
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,360
unsurprisingly as a result of these

1728
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,400
missing Vantage points the current

1729
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,980
extent of how much scanning is actually

1730
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,360
happening how much vulnerability

1731
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,580
scanning is happening in the V6 space is

1732
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,860
largely unknown and this is the key

1733
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,660
question that we want to shed light on

1734
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,219
here in this work is kind of what's

1735
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:10,920
going on in the in the IPv6 space in

1736
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,739
terms of vulnerability scanning

1737
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:16,140
and for that we present the first uh

1738
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,780
longitudinal study on what we see in

1739
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,239
terms of large-scale IPv6 scans and we

1740
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:23,520
use two data sets for that the primary

1741
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,400
data set is 15 months worth of firewall

1742
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,159
locks that we collected at some a bunch

1743
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:32,280
of CDN CDN Edge Edge machines that's our

1744
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,980
primary data set so essentially every

1745
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,860
packet that is not web that goes to any

1746
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,719
of these machines is blocked at the

1747
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:43,739
firewall and we we actually we log this

1748
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,080
um what we also do to improve

1749
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,179
reproducibility of some of our findings

1750
01:10:48,179 --> 01:10:50,699
we double check some of the most Salient

1751
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:52,380
findings with what can be seen in

1752
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,420
publicly available traffic traces and

1753
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,280
these are namely the the Maui traffic

1754
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,440
traces which are available to the to the

1755
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,780
research community

1756
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,820
um okay so before um showing you how

1757
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,380
much scanning is happening I quickly

1758
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,140
want to talk about why our advantage

1759
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,500
points are capable of seeing IPv6

1760
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,360
scanning because I just mentioned that

1761
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,280
it's difficult to find such Vantage

1762
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,920
points now for the CDN um our

1763
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,440
front-facing IP addresses are widely

1764
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,260
exposed via DNS right so clients request

1765
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:25,199
content we return our IP addresses we

1766
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,780
engage in Myriad transactions with with

1767
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,760
millions and millions of hosts So

1768
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,280
eventually the IP addresses can end up

1769
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,920
on on IPv6 hit lists and scanners can

1770
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,219
start targeting our our addresses

1771
01:11:38,219 --> 01:11:41,159
um so this is for the CDN the Maui data

1772
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,500
set is essentially traffic captured on

1773
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,020
on the wire on a Transit link and there

1774
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,239
it is really just if someone is scanning

1775
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,940
the V6 space and if the scan traffic off

1776
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,800
that scanner happens to cross that

1777
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,380
particular link we will of course uh see

1778
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,960
it see it in the data set

1779
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,960
and what we focus on here in this work

1780
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,900
is what we termed large scale IPv6 scans

1781
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,480
and what that essentially means is that

1782
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,940
we consider a source to be a scanner if

1783
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,000
that Source targets more than 100

1784
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,280
destination IPS in short order

1785
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,020
and there are many more details in the

1786
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:17,159
paper we need to do a bunch of

1787
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:18,960
pre-filtering of course

1788
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,400
um but this is this is kind of the

1789
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,080
essence of what we

1790
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,980
um call a large-scale IPv6 scan okay now

1791
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,260
um let me show you how much scanning we

1792
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,580
actually detect

1793
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,820
and in this plot here show you for our

1794
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,400
entire measurement period the number of

1795
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,800
weekly active scan sources that we

1796
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,739
detect in this case here at the CDN CDN

1797
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:41,880
vantage point

1798
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,880
and so the key takeaway from this slide

1799
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,699
here is that IPv6 is now actively being

1800
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:50,159
scanned we find evidence of scanning

1801
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,219
scanning sources now um let's be clear

1802
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:55,199
we find between roughly 10 and 100

1803
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:58,440
active weekly sources scanning IPv6 and

1804
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,600
that is nothing compared to what we see

1805
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,699
in the ipv4 space so that's we should

1806
01:13:02,699 --> 01:13:04,860
just be very clear about that but still

1807
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:07,140
there is evidence of folks starting to

1808
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,120
to scan the space

1809
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,040
uh now the question of course is like

1810
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,679
who is who is scanning and for that I

1811
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,900
want to show you this this table here in

1812
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,440
this table we show the top 20 Source ass

1813
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,659
from which we see scanning traffic IPv6

1814
01:13:21,659 --> 01:13:23,280
scanning traffic and we make can make a

1815
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,020
couple of observations when when looking

1816
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,179
at this table and I guess the first one

1817
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:29,100
is that what we see is really heavily

1818
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,500
concentrated on a very small number of

1819
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,500
of Highly highly active as's so the top

1820
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,500
10 ass account for more than 99 of all

1821
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,179
the scanning traffic that the that we

1822
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:41,880
that we Lock And if we look at the

1823
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,260
business types

1824
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,840
um of the of the scan sources we can see

1825
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,020
that it's primarily data center ISS and

1826
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,940
Cloud as is you know these are the ISS

1827
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,380
where you would expect to have the

1828
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,960
respective resources available to

1829
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,860
conduct these large-scale IPv6 scans

1830
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:01,199
um now um and we see and I should

1831
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,460
probably mention that we also see

1832
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,380
several cyber security companies

1833
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,840
starting to actively scan scan the IPv6

1834
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,719
space and we see this in our Lots now

1835
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:12,659
speaking of sources and we see cloud and

1836
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:14,640
we see cyber security companies and then

1837
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,679
there are these two

1838
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:19,260
um mysterious assets at the very top and

1839
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:22,320
return them data center uh which are

1840
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,560
geographically mapped to to China and we

1841
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,659
are not able to associate them with any

1842
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:29,940
any major cloud provider and

1843
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:32,580
interestingly the top most active

1844
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:35,940
scanning sources that we see in IPv6 at

1845
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:39,540
the CDN is also the most active scanning

1846
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,699
source that we see in our second data

1847
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:44,520
set in the Maui trace and I think it's

1848
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,260
just worthwhile to mention this so this

1849
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,300
is the by far most active Source it has

1850
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,400
been continuously scanning the IPv6

1851
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,500
space for almost two years and it is

1852
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,900
still scanning right now I just checked

1853
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,120
some publicly available sources earlier

1854
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,460
today and so it's the most active Source

1855
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,080
in both our vantage point and it was

1856
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,120
also reported thousands of times in

1857
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,159
publicly available data and I screenshot

1858
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:07,199
it one of them here so this is public

1859
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,960
information they must must have ample

1860
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,640
bandwidth and resources and we don't

1861
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,500
really know who or what is behind this

1862
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,480
so if you have any insights you would

1863
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,699
really love to learn more about this

1864
01:15:17,699 --> 01:15:20,880
Super Active scan source okay a quick

1865
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,460
note on the ports targeted by the IPv6

1866
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,860
scanners that we see this is a short

1867
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,600
slide because there's not that much to

1868
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,179
say what we find

1869
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:33,900
in contrast to ipv4 is that most of the

1870
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,460
scans that we see they target multiple

1871
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:38,760
port numbers in the in on on on the

1872
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,860
house as opposed to individual ports and

1873
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,780
if you want to interpret that one

1874
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,300
interpretation is that what we see is

1875
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,760
kind of rather resembling what you would

1876
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,020
expect to see from the kind of General

1877
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:51,900
penetration testing Behavior as opposed

1878
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:54,600
to folks trying to exploit specific

1879
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,540
vulnerabilities in specific Services

1880
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,659
um in the in the IPv6 space

1881
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:02,880
okay so so much for the services

1882
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,159
targeted I want to briefly return to

1883
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:07,860
this table and you may have noticed that

1884
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:09,540
in this table and also in the plot

1885
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:11,880
earlier when we talk about scan sources

1886
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,380
here we show like three different

1887
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:17,460
columns and what we basically do here is

1888
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:20,460
that in the in we report scan sources

1889
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:24,600
when we trade any Source 128-bit IPv6

1890
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,520
address individually that is the

1891
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,500
rightmost column and then

1892
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,600
additionally we show what happens if we

1893
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,400
first aggregate all the traffic for an

1894
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,100
individual 64 prefix and then apply our

1895
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,040
scan detection and we also show

1896
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,600
um the scan sources when first

1897
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,280
aggregating the traffic for an entire

1898
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,340
slash 48 IPv6 prefix and then applying

1899
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,739
or scan detection and you can see that

1900
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:48,179
the number of State numbers they they

1901
01:16:48,179 --> 01:16:50,100
vary greatly right depending on the

1902
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,140
different aggregation level and this

1903
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,540
hints at something that we stumbled upon

1904
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,060
during while executing this work and we

1905
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,560
believe that this is a major Challenge

1906
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,500
and that is kind of identifying and

1907
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,020
isolating the scan individual scan

1908
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:07,080
sources in the in the IPv6 space and I

1909
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,179
want to quickly Show You by example what

1910
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:11,280
I what I mean here

1911
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,080
now first of all the numbers here in

1912
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,400
this slide are fiction they're they're

1913
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,560
made up but I want to highlight we find

1914
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,900
very similar cases in our in our actual

1915
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,239
data set now consider the first case we

1916
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,520
have a cyber security company and they

1917
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,120
announced a slash uh 32 prefix in in bgp

1918
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,820
and from what we see is that there's one

1919
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:33,179
single scan Source behind this slash 32

1920
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:35,699
prefix that leverages the entire outer

1921
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:38,580
space behind this slash 32 to send out

1922
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,679
scan probes and what that essentially

1923
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:42,900
means is that every individual scan

1924
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:45,780
packet that hits our firewall carries a

1925
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:48,659
unique IPv6 Source IP address

1926
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:50,280
and of course that's a problem for

1927
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,380
detection right because if you would

1928
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,900
attempt to detect V6 scanning for

1929
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,600
individual slash 128 IP addresses this

1930
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,520
would just not be possible because at

1931
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,739
most you would see one individual packet

1932
01:18:01,739 --> 01:18:04,620
and for this particular case what we

1933
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,500
would have to do to to isolate and then

1934
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,420
to correctly pinpoint the standings

1935
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,460
first is to aggregate all the traffic up

1936
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,520
to an entire slash 32 prefix now we

1937
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,140
could say okay then let's just do that

1938
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,420
but that's that's a problem because it

1939
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:20,340
only works for this particular source

1940
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:23,100
and in contrast to that we find one

1941
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,840
other host which is actually a

1942
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,540
well-known cloud provider from we see

1943
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,100
scanning traffic from this network as

1944
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,560
well they announced also a slash 32 in

1945
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,080
bgp but each individual virtual machine

1946
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,040
each individual user only has a slash

1947
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,620
124 assigned and the the issue here

1948
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,360
would be if we would aggregate all this

1949
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:45,480
up to a slash 32 we aggregate the entire

1950
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,640
cloud provider together and if

1951
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,040
subsequently we to use this to make

1952
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,780
decisions about for example rate

1953
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,060
limiting or blocking traffic we would

1954
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,520
cause a lot of collateral damage for all

1955
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,500
the other users in this in the Scout

1956
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,380
provider right and I just kind of um

1957
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,480
want to highlight this here again so the

1958
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,580
key thing is that without aggregation we

1959
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,620
may not be able to even detect scans or

1960
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:09,480
we may miss a bunch of that on the other

1961
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,460
hand if you use too much aggregation we

1962
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,040
will conflate different scanners and if

1963
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,020
used for subsequent blocking we could

1964
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,659
block way too much and I know that some

1965
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:20,280
folks in this room are very well aware

1966
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,960
of this issue here but I just kind of

1967
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,460
want to highlight it again and this is

1968
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:26,040
not just related to scanning in the IPv6

1969
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,780
space but we believe there's a broader

1970
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,340
issue here and that is that the

1971
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,800
flexibility of assigning a V6 addresses

1972
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,960
poses really a challenge when it comes

1973
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,239
to kind of isolating and attributing

1974
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,159
potentially blocking or block listing

1975
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,620
any sort of malicious activity in the in

1976
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:43,320
the IPv6 space and here's just one

1977
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,480
incarnation of where we stumble upon

1978
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,500
this problem

1979
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,380
okay and with that I want to conclude so

1980
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,300
key findings yes we do actually have

1981
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,360
evidence of scanning in the IPv6 space

1982
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,860
there are challenges with detection and

1983
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:58,320
attribution of of scanning activity and

1984
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,120
of course as usual you can find many

1985
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,679
more details on the methodology the

1986
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:04,679
Vantage points etc etc in our paper I

1987
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:06,239
hope I could get you interested in

1988
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,839
reading it

1989
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:11,000
okay thanks for that time

1990
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,260
Phillip finished a minute or at least so

1991
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,060
we let a couple more people in Bob can

1992
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,260
you go yep

1993
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:21,780
hi yo and I saw the paper I was sort of

1994
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,060
very interested to see so it seems to me

1995
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,580
you've seen two things that there's not

1996
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:28,620
very much scanning going on that you can

1997
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,640
detect

1998
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,620
it was nice to see that I think the

1999
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,840
slide that's at 10 to 100 as opposed to

2000
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,840
the numbers you see with before but then

2001
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,940
the other thing I had never thought of

2002
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,440
before was that

2003
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,540
because it's very easy to generate a lot

2004
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:45,179
of source addresses if you were scanning

2005
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:47,820
you could it's a lot harder to see that

2006
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:50,820
it's going on but I think we're probably

2007
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:53,659
okay for a while

2008
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:58,820
thanks Bob uh Elliot you're up

2009
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:05,340
hi Philip nice paper thanks very much

2010
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:08,280
um one quick question uh how did the

2011
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,980
aggregated traffic that you saw in terms

2012
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,600
of the total aggregate of traffic for

2013
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,820
scanning for those sources for those top

2014
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:18,480
sources you saw compared to the rest of

2015
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,120
the traffic that might have been scan

2016
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,140
traffic

2017
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:25,140
so was that five percent ten percent of

2018
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:27,300
total scan traffic 100 you know fifty

2019
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,800
percent of total scan traffic that you

2020
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,340
estimate

2021
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,920
uh that's that's I I'm not sure I fully

2022
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,239
understand the question so the thing is

2023
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,760
that we had to we we had to do a bunch

2024
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,620
of pre-filtering before we applied a

2025
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,540
scan detection regardless because we see

2026
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,360
a lot of connection artifacts and

2027
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,140
um

2028
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:48,780
in terms of this one scanner this large

2029
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,880
cyber security company literally every

2030
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,980
all the packets that we saw from them

2031
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:55,440
were scanning

2032
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,699
for the cloud provider naturally you

2033
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:01,140
would expect a bunch of other stuff to

2034
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:02,880
to show up in the in the in in the

2035
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,840
aggregate the reason I ask is

2036
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,940
um is it that we don't have a lot of

2037
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,980
botnets out there today that that's

2038
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:14,040
speak IPv6 and therefore you can avoid

2039
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:17,340
you you can aggregate this way but once

2040
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:19,260
we have those botnets we'll just you

2041
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,880
know what will the what should the

2042
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,659
methodology be

2043
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,380
yes I think that's a that's a great

2044
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:28,739
point and um we don't from all or that

2045
01:22:28,739 --> 01:22:30,540
we see we currently don't have botnets

2046
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:34,140
in IPv6 and what currently saves us may

2047
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,179
just be the fact that IPv6 addresses are

2048
01:22:36,179 --> 01:22:38,520
hard are not really exposed that often I

2049
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,739
mean hours are exposed by idns but

2050
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:43,199
client IP addresses often are not but

2051
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:45,179
once that starts to happen and once we

2052
01:22:45,179 --> 01:22:47,280
have botnets I don't know what the best

2053
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,020
way is in moving forward and how to kind

2054
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:52,460
of aggregating them and stopping them

2055
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:55,560
all right thanks a lot Phillip I

2056
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,060
appreciate you bringing this to the

2057
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,239
group

2058
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:05,100
all right we have Leslie up next and

2059
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,120
Leslie kindly offered to uh do her

2060
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,640
presentation in 10 minutes so we'll have

2061
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,739
a couple of minutes for questions for

2062
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:17,059
the subsequent talks

2063
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:38,960
all right you're set go ahead Leslie

2064
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:43,380
ah so hello everyone and um just a point

2065
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:45,659
of clarity here that uh all of the

2066
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:47,460
actual hard work that I'm about to

2067
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,560
present the numbers the the actual

2068
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,960
testing so on and so forth was done by

2069
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,380
rufo DeFrancisco and his team uh and I

2070
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:56,940
basically grabbed a bunch of his slides

2071
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,440
and hard work and put them together to

2072
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,739
make a message today so uh if there are

2073
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:03,060
things that seem a little odd in this no

2074
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:05,820
doubt it was my transcription and not

2075
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:08,159
his work

2076
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:08,880
um

2077
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,500
so this is actually really going to fall

2078
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,060
on rather nicely from the presentation

2079
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:13,920
we just had everything I'm going to say

2080
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,100
is focused on the the V4 space

2081
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,300
um but I'll have a few comments about

2082
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:20,460
how that relates to scanning so on and

2083
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,080
so forth

2084
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,159
um

2085
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:24,600
so I wanted to talk a little bit about

2086
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,120
what is the scope of the problem of

2087
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,239
attacks in the iot space and why does

2088
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,280
why does my day job care why does the

2089
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,780
global cyber Alliance care well because

2090
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:36,000
we're not for profit aiming to reduce

2091
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,340
cyber risk and we have this project

2092
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,739
called Aid which is supposed to be an

2093
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:43,020
automated iot defense ecosystem

2094
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:45,840
or how to help address security at the

2095
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,780
edges uh given knowledge about what goes

2096
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:50,640
on in the network and the truth of the

2097
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,320
matter is right now it's not automated

2098
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,840
it's not a defense ecosystem and on bad

2099
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,540
days we're not even sure it's iot

2100
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,640
um but nomenclature notwithstanding we

2101
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,500
do have a global honey farm with

2102
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,600
hundreds of sensors across the globe

2103
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,239
that's been collecting data for four

2104
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:09,239
plus years now and we also have our own

2105
01:25:09,239 --> 01:25:12,620
Honeypot technology

2106
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,960
so and and the why do we all in this

2107
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,540
room care about iot security well um I

2108
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,620
think that most people here will

2109
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,920
remember the botnet Mirai that uh was

2110
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,260
marshaled to attack the dying company

2111
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:28,860
resources in 2016 which is just evidence

2112
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:29,820
of

2113
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,940
um how very impactful a group of uh

2114
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:36,120
motivated tiny devices can actually be

2115
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:39,300
um if given the wrong coordination

2116
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,159
um but one of the side effects of that

2117
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:44,640
particular effect was that there are now

2118
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,500
many laws against having devices with

2119
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,140
default unchangeable passwords

2120
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,820
um and a variety of other Regulators

2121
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,260
have gotten interested in a variety of

2122
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,659
other proposals of policies mostly

2123
01:25:54,659 --> 01:25:56,880
oriented towards iot devices but

2124
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,040
generally oriented towards any device

2125
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,440
connected to the internet

2126
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,780
um and I wanted also to make the point

2127
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:04,739
that

2128
01:26:04,739 --> 01:26:06,540
um the actors that we see hitting our

2129
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:07,800
honey farm

2130
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,159
are hitting all of the open V4 ports as

2131
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:14,940
well so what we actually see is

2132
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,199
um in essence

2133
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:18,300
a lot of the Bad actors acting out on

2134
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,159
the V4 internet and in a different

2135
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,080
version of this talk I would be talking

2136
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,699
about how maybe we should stop it at the

2137
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:25,679
source and get network operators to

2138
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:27,360
understand when stuff is coming out of

2139
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,760
their networks rather than just trying

2140
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,400
to focus on how do we defend at the

2141
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,620
device level which I think goes a little

2142
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:38,159
bit to the how do we block list B6 is it

2143
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,139
right to aggregate I think the right

2144
01:26:40,139 --> 01:26:42,840
answer I hope the right answer is never

2145
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,120
a better block list

2146
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,679
um I really want us to get to the point

2147
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:48,900
where we have better detection of crap

2148
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,460
coming out of networks and stopping it

2149
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:52,380
as well as what other whatever other

2150
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:55,920
mitigations on device and in software

2151
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,860
so that's where I'll Focus for now

2152
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:00,480
um this slide just gives you a bit of a

2153
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,880
sense of just how much crap there is out

2154
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:03,900
there

2155
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,520
um again if you take into account that

2156
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,520
this is what each of our sensors which

2157
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,739
is you know an undifferentiated little

2158
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:12,179
Unix

2159
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:15,120
blob type thing that's responding as if

2160
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,179
it's an iot device sees is the same

2161
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:21,420
thing that your connected home device or

2162
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:22,980
your anything that's connected to the

2163
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,900
internet sees

2164
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,100
um consider that they're getting about

2165
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:29,520
5000 attacks a day

2166
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,320
um in the gray just to explain the

2167
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:32,820
anomalies the gray bit in the middle of

2168
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,920
this is when we were switching over uh

2169
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,840
decommissioning an old honey honey farm

2170
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:40,139
and commission commissioning a new one

2171
01:27:40,139 --> 01:27:43,020
um sorry my screen keeps going to sleep

2172
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:45,480
um and so there was a certain amount of

2173
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,760
overlap between sensors so it's a little

2174
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,280
vague in terms of how to attribute the

2175
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,500
attacks

2176
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,780
um and then apparently the spike over in

2177
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:57,840
September was a bunch of Amazon IPS

2178
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,980
attacking Romania who knows

2179
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:04,800
um and again that that it really is it's

2180
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,360
coming from everywhere it's going to

2181
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,820
everywhere there is nowhere to hide

2182
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,679
um if it's many of these attacks are

2183
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:13,800
actually coming through tor-like VPN

2184
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,199
Services uh so that the source IP

2185
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:18,420
addresses that we're seeing are in any

2186
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:20,820
number of cases unsuspecting home users

2187
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:22,560
who just thought they were getting you

2188
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,780
know cheap access to Netflix resources

2189
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:26,219
in some other country and had no idea

2190
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:27,840
that they were actually offering up

2191
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,840
their internet access to be a source of

2192
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:33,080
an attack

2193
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:37,080
so um back to the let's make some

2194
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,659
policies uh we decided we would do some

2195
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:42,540
a b testing so configure to the standard

2196
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:44,159
approach to doing testing have a control

2197
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:45,960
have a test subject

2198
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,659
um and see which see whether or not any

2199
01:28:48,659 --> 01:28:50,880
of these policies were actually useful

2200
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,580
so in phase one we set up some of our

2201
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,679
own honeypots these proxy pots in a

2202
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,120
honey farm

2203
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,580
um with virtualized devices with common

2204
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,320
controls from the policies that are

2205
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,300
being proposed

2206
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,219
um so and then we put them out in the

2207
01:29:05,219 --> 01:29:07,620
wild just to see what happens in terms

2208
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:09,600
of the the attacks and whether or not

2209
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,980
applying the controls was actually

2210
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,960
effective in

2211
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,159
um in securing the device

2212
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,820
um and you all know what the answer is

2213
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:19,920
going to be right about passwords I mean

2214
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,260
I don't need to say this do I no default

2215
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:26,760
passwords anyway it said it so um yes so

2216
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,280
we had the 70 honeypots emulating some

2217
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,900
fairly common

2218
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,420
um devices with iot thoroughly common

2219
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,480
iot like software Stacks

2220
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,340
um had 10 different honey pots deployed

2221
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:41,219
for each of the seven emulations 5A 5B

2222
01:29:41,219 --> 01:29:43,860
and collected data for two months and

2223
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:46,020
saw over three quarters of a million

2224
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:48,780
sessions with over a million HTV

2225
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:52,080
requests and HTTP responses and a very

2226
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,639
small number of those were actually

2227
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:56,340
scans by search Bots and the remaining

2228
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,380
over three quarter million were actually

2229
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:00,540
classified as a tax so I think that goes

2230
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,880
a little bit to the question of uh What

2231
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,500
proportion of of traffic that you're

2232
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,500
seeing is scans or attacks at least in

2233
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,159
the V4 world

2234
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:14,280
yeah so

2235
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,760
this is uh 7 500 just over 7 500

2236
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,159
attempts to log in with password

2237
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:23,460
credentials to these honey Bots and the

2238
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,080
hardened device I.E non-default password

2239
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,960
was never cracked and the default

2240
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,659
password devices were cracked in just

2241
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:33,060
short of 80 times so that may seem

2242
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:35,040
pretty trivial in terms of penetration

2243
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,900
rate but there's two things I would have

2244
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,420
you take away from this one when you

2245
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,639
amplify this by number of attacks a

2246
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:43,139
number of devices available this is

2247
01:30:43,139 --> 01:30:45,540
still a non not not insignificant number

2248
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:49,020
of compromises and two there are a lot

2249
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,760
of dumb attacks out there right this is

2250
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,219
not this is mostly Mirai like things

2251
01:30:53,219 --> 01:30:54,600
that are roving the internet with this

2252
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,060
known set of default passwords as

2253
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,500
opposed to targeted

2254
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,540
attacks which also happened in the

2255
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:01,320
internet

2256
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,179
so one of the reasons why I think it

2257
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:05,699
would be valuable to get rid of the

2258
01:31:05,699 --> 01:31:08,159
um attacks at sources so we could stop

2259
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:09,719
seeing so much clutter and actually have

2260
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:11,280
a better shot dragging down some of the

2261
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,159
more targeted attacks

2262
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:16,080
um yeah so these were some findings from

2263
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,540
that first phase that yes no fault

2264
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,340
default passwords is actually good

2265
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:22,139
policy advice

2266
01:31:22,139 --> 01:31:24,360
um and that attackers prefer non-secured

2267
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,219
communication protocols at least through

2268
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:28,739
this time last year

2269
01:31:28,739 --> 01:31:30,239
um and the updated software prevents

2270
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:31,320
break-ins

2271
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,260
more of this detail is available in the

2272
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:37,080
white paper we produced last year for

2273
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,600
phase one and there is now a link to it

2274
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,380
in the last slide on this presentation

2275
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,659
um but we did find also that in looking

2276
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:47,100
through the various attacks the

2277
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,380
attackers were attempting to exploit the

2278
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,760
software sac

2279
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,139
so

2280
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,420
um largely even on small devices

2281
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:56,280
attempting to attack the web server used

2282
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,960
for administrative control of the device

2283
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,719
so we thought hey maybe we should have a

2284
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,940
look at that

2285
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:06,259
which led to phase two

2286
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,739
um so

2287
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:11,040
we have the Honey Farm again set up with

2288
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,560
69 devices and a variety of

2289
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,360
configurations

2290
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,340
um with either weak or strong

2291
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:19,380
credentials an up-to-date version of

2292
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:21,420
software or not

2293
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:24,780
um so that's the red and the green

2294
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:26,460
um but zipping right along in terms of

2295
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:27,780
time

2296
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:30,780
the uh this one was active for just over

2297
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:32,520
half a year

2298
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,980
um recording almost 2 million meaningful

2299
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,960
attacks on the devices approximately 100

2300
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,840
attacks per device per day

2301
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,500
um and really there was no particular

2302
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,600
favoring of one type of device over

2303
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,620
another

2304
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:49,320
although the cygnus patched seemed to

2305
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,699
have gotten slightly less than the

2306
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:53,000
others

2307
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,219
um but in this instance you can see that

2308
01:32:58,219 --> 01:33:01,199
by and large two-thirds of the attacks

2309
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,060
were actually on the software stack

2310
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:04,800
with a small much smaller number one

2311
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,080
sixth on the device interface itself and

2312
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,540
then there are the botnets again

2313
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:12,060
um so PHP and SQL were the software

2314
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,860
ingredients ingredients that were most

2315
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,420
often targeted there's probably no

2316
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:16,560
surprise there

2317
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,600
but most attacks were really an attempt

2318
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,300
to exploit known vulnerabilities so

2319
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,820
that's kind of an important point

2320
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:25,860
um so

2321
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:26,520
um

2322
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,199
one of the things that particularly

2323
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:29,639
stood out when we were looking at the

2324
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:31,020
results from this was the number of

2325
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:34,800
attacks against boa which has been uh

2326
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,199
long since unsupported and discontinued

2327
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:40,500
like from 2005 but it still not only

2328
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,960
sought after by attackers it's it's out

2329
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,000
there it's deployed

2330
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,580
um and while people are still finding

2331
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,560
vulnerabilities in it of course since

2332
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,060
it's unsupported these are not getting

2333
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:53,520
fixed devices are not being updated

2334
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,440
um and apart from that many attacks

2335
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,560
against think PHP which is a PHP

2336
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,840
framework Which is popular in China

2337
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,000
although a few vulnerabilities are being

2338
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,280
reported and disclosed there

2339
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:10,980
so uh in this instance it basically

2340
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:14,340
shows that um having a an up-to-date

2341
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:16,739
software stack and proper password

2342
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:18,960
control does improve

2343
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,000
um then it not only improves the

2344
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,560
likelihood of surviving attack it makes

2345
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,320
you less interesting to the attackers

2346
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,940
um because you can see in the far right

2347
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:28,380
bar

2348
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:30,480
um that's the the most up-to-date and

2349
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,980
patched version with a strong password

2350
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:36,739
saw far fewer attacks than the rest

2351
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:38,159
um

2352
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:40,980
yeah not much more to say about this

2353
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,420
unless there are further questions and

2354
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:44,340
Elliot will get to you at the end

2355
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:46,020
um but I did want to say

2356
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:48,120
um in terms of conclusions that the

2357
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,860
Fairly obvious device security is

2358
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:51,480
necessary it's important to have device

2359
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:55,139
passwords that are updatable and not

2360
01:34:55,139 --> 01:34:57,719
um and and not default

2361
01:34:57,719 --> 01:34:59,400
um but there's still a whole world of

2362
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,159
hurt from known vulnerabilities and we

2363
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:04,679
can assume the devices are are updated

2364
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:07,380
or are going to be updatable

2365
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:10,980
um or even that new devices being built

2366
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:14,100
are using current versions of software

2367
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:16,920
so the legacy of

2368
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,020
um all of these cves and the

2369
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:21,659
implications for security of devices in

2370
01:35:21,659 --> 01:35:25,620
your network has a really long tail

2371
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:27,840
um and going forward regulation May

2372
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,239
address some of this but it's only going

2373
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,340
to be in the you know the small category

2374
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:35,060
of devices that are responsive to

2375
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,380
regulation in in various parts of the

2376
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:39,239
world and they're still going to be that

2377
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:41,400
you know Legacy of devices and software

2378
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,020
stacks

2379
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:44,940
um so we really do need to figure out

2380
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:48,120
how to address things going forward

2381
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:49,560
um there was some work going on in the

2382
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,120
iot office working group which is

2383
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,980
looking at how do you secure your iot

2384
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:56,159
devices that's pretty valuable

2385
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,139
um but we also have to think about well

2386
01:35:58,139 --> 01:36:01,500
we can't air gap every iot device

2387
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,239
um there are have been interesting

2388
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:04,980
stories of medical devices medical

2389
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:07,320
fridges for instance why does the

2390
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,639
medical fridge need to be on the

2391
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:09,840
internet

2392
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,340
well it turns out the medical fridge

2393
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:12,719
needs to be on the internet so that it

2394
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:14,100
can send an email if the temperature

2395
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:16,800
gets out of spec and yes when the

2396
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,480
medical fridge gets owned that is a

2397
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,120
problem so these are the kinds of real

2398
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,860
networking security challenges that need

2399
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,620
to be addressed in a meaningful way

2400
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:28,139
given all of this the implications for

2401
01:36:28,139 --> 01:36:30,000
security in the device and software

2402
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,139
stack

2403
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:33,960
um so I'm positing that you know as I

2404
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,400
said earlier I think it's an interesting

2405
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,020
question to deal with the software

2406
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:38,580
attacks at source out of the source

2407
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:41,100
networks that's part of a solution

2408
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:42,659
but I think we also need tools and

2409
01:36:42,659 --> 01:36:44,280
techniques to Monitor and manage the

2410
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,739
networks where all of our devices are

2411
01:36:46,739 --> 01:36:48,659
connected I don't know if we will ever

2412
01:36:48,659 --> 01:36:51,060
have an automated iot defense ecosystem

2413
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:53,880
at GCA but maybe smarter Minds will

2414
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,679
actually be able to develop that and

2415
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,719
certainly we'd love to talk with anyone

2416
01:36:57,719 --> 01:37:01,380
who's interested in figuring that out

2417
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:03,420
that's it further details available here

2418
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:04,860
for phase one and phase two is

2419
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,380
forthcoming thanks Leslie I want to

2420
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,060
encourage anybody else that's interested

2421
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:10,320
in participating with root of contact

2422
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,199
Leslie directly we're going to switch to

2423
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:15,179
the last two presentations thanks for

2424
01:37:15,179 --> 01:37:17,580
helping accommodate uh in the time we

2425
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:20,880
have Leslie great thanks

2426
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:25,280
uh Ignacio is up next and

2427
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:34,139
you wanna you want me to share your

2428
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:35,000
friends

2429
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,139
you don't want to request sharing

2430
01:37:37,139 --> 01:37:38,219
yourself

2431
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:41,179
if you have a device

2432
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,960
you can click request sharing are you

2433
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:49,560
logged in English sorry

2434
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:52,159
foreign

2435
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,960
I'm wondering how is the idea of doing

2436
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,120
uh Nexus live please

2437
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,920
because we think that that's important

2438
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:13,620
as measuring protocols is to measure the

2439
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:15,480
process of standardization of those

2440
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,540
protocols next and this is part of an

2441
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,040
ongoing work with a bunch of colleagues

2442
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,420
from Glasgow and Queen Mary University

2443
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:24,120
my University and has been published so

2444
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,860
far very nice it will be the same on AMC

2445
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:27,960
and all the work is available in our

2446
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:30,179
website next please

2447
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:32,940
and a well there are many conspiracies

2448
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,320
in the internet the internet is not one

2449
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,820
of them actually it's quite cool that we

2450
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,100
know who did what and when they did it

2451
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,199
and that's precisely what we look at uh

2452
01:38:40,199 --> 01:38:42,659
natural place we look at the minutes of

2453
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:45,480
the internet and that's uh next slide

2454
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:49,380
uh rfc's emails and drops next time

2455
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,360
and one of the first things that we see

2456
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:54,600
uh is that there is a decrease in number

2457
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,639
of female participants uh next one

2458
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:59,460
please while at the same time we have an

2459
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:01,380
increasing number uh sorry unstable

2460
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,420
number of females so basically the ipf

2461
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:05,400
seems to be becoming increasingly chatty

2462
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:07,679
next one please

2463
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:09,960
uh next one please

2464
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,760
and to get a better understanding of

2465
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,239
that we look at the how are these emails

2466
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:17,219
organized we do a graph of the emails

2467
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:19,639
and we identify the different components

2468
01:39:19,639 --> 01:39:21,840
basically interconnected groups of

2469
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,699
people next one please

2470
01:39:23,699 --> 01:39:25,500
and identify the largest connected

2471
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,480
component next one please

2472
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,460
and what we find is that the largest

2473
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:31,320
connected component has been mostly

2474
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,420
growing over time and the number of less

2475
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,100
connected components has been decreasing

2476
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,679
which would point to a more cohesive IDF

2477
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:39,960
which is probably a good sign uh next

2478
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,400
one please

2479
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,800
and together understanding we try to

2480
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,659
look at the influence of people inside

2481
01:39:45,659 --> 01:39:49,139
of the ipf and we approximate this using

2482
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:50,639
uh between us which is the typical

2483
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,040
approach in social network analysis and

2484
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,800
what you consider is uh the largest

2485
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,960
connected component when you start to

2486
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,659
remove people depending how influential

2487
01:40:00,659 --> 01:40:02,699
they are next one please

2488
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:04,920
and what you consider is basically two

2489
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,900
basic takeaways uh

2490
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,940
there is a lot of relevance of

2491
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:10,920
influential participants and this has

2492
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,840
been growing over time basically if you

2493
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,639
take away the most the most influential

2494
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,860
people in the ITF the largest connected

2495
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:19,560
component drops very fast in terms of

2496
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:21,139
size

2497
01:40:21,139 --> 01:40:24,120
uh how about the emails who sent those

2498
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,280
emails well what we see is that the next

2499
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,620
one please uh

2500
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,659
emails are mostly dominated by

2501
01:40:30,659 --> 01:40:33,420
influential participants this has not

2502
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:34,739
changed much over time which is probably

2503
01:40:34,739 --> 01:40:37,500
a good sign uh but what if we look at

2504
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:40,080
who offers which traps next one please

2505
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,719
uh what we find is that there is an

2506
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:45,300
influential minority that increasingly

2507
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:47,880
dominates uh draft production

2508
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,280
uh next one please and at the same time

2509
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,800
it takes longer time to gain influence

2510
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,040
in the IDF Nexus like please

2511
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:59,340
and why is this why is this rise of more

2512
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:02,100
influential participants up maybe it's

2513
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,960
because conversations are more complex

2514
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:06,300
that that's the evidence that we seem to

2515
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:08,940
find uh we have that increasingly more

2516
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:12,420
rsr discussed within the ITF and we also

2517
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:14,400
find that the those that are more

2518
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:18,179
influential discuss more areas next

2519
01:41:18,179 --> 01:41:20,520
and it's not just that they discuss more

2520
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,620
areas that they

2521
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:25,560
the amount of discussion that they have

2522
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:28,320
across these areas is evenly distributed

2523
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,239
up I won't get into the details of what

2524
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:32,639
topic entropy means but the key takeaway

2525
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,980
is that people discuss more areas and

2526
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:37,320
they discard more discuss more each of

2527
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:40,080
the areas they discuss next please

2528
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,400
next

2529
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,619
one more yes

2530
01:41:43,619 --> 01:41:46,619
so why are we having this more complex

2531
01:41:46,619 --> 01:41:49,980
conversations why is that and

2532
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:52,139
we hypothesize that maybe it's because

2533
01:41:52,139 --> 01:41:54,960
it's harder to publish next please

2534
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,600
and we find that this seems to be the

2535
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,940
guy the case it takes now three more

2536
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:03,840
times to publish uh an RFC that's the

2537
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,340
number of days it takes from first draft

2538
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:07,199
to RFC publication

2539
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:09,000
uh next place

2540
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,520
and at the same time it also takes many

2541
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,900
more drafts

2542
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:15,000
to publish an RFC

2543
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,679
and there are a bunch of other things

2544
01:42:16,679 --> 01:42:19,080
that I'm not showing here that make this

2545
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:20,820
make more sense and for example like we

2546
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:23,340
have more authors more institutions more

2547
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:25,080
affiliations more countries

2548
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:26,699
participating which of course probably

2549
01:42:26,699 --> 01:42:28,739
inflates the number of emails it's more

2550
01:42:28,739 --> 01:42:30,360
difficult as you probably know to have a

2551
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,920
zoom call with people from all over the

2552
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,500
world more institutions more emails

2553
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,480
Nexus like this

2554
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,780
and we have more work ongoing uh but

2555
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:41,520
this is the basic key takeaways that we

2556
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,440
have found conversations seem to be more

2557
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,540
complex it seems to be harder to publish

2558
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:47,040
and it seems that there is an

2559
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,860
influential minority upon which the ITF

2560
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:52,139
is increasingly dependent and we are

2561
01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:53,940
doing quite a lot of work in trying to

2562
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:56,400
get a more ground rule on this Finance

2563
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,800
so we're very happy to hear back from

2564
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,659
you if you have any insights or if you

2565
01:43:00,659 --> 01:43:02,400
want to give us hand with this

2566
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,020
recommendation tool that we are building

2567
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:07,139
to help uh recommend reviewers for

2568
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:10,080
drafts uh and we also have a meeting uh

2569
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,300
a little bit later if people want to

2570
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,820
join and think that uh analyzing the

2571
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:17,460
process of standardization is something

2572
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:19,380
that we should be doing thank you very

2573
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,219
much

2574
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:23,659
thanks a lot and take your chocolate

2575
01:43:23,659 --> 01:43:26,639
and drink something yeah thanks for

2576
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:29,530
bringing this meta measurement about

2577
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:32,400
[Music]

2578
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,480
so

2579
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:35,119
um

2580
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:38,760
sorry sorry we don't have a queue so

2581
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,580
thank you for being here yes but please

2582
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:45,500
talk to him and ask for more later

2583
01:43:45,659 --> 01:43:50,000
all right and we've got got them up next

2584
01:44:02,119 --> 01:44:05,480
the last one

2585
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,699
there you go

2586
01:44:08,699 --> 01:44:11,239
perfect

01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:15,960
hello

2588
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,320
um my name is Gautama kiwate and for

2589
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,239
those who have seen me talk in the last

2590
01:44:21,239 --> 01:44:22,860
few days

2591
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:25,440
um I just don't do DNS like I also work

2592
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,679
on other things and this is work that I

2593
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:31,139
uh that we've done with Folks at

2594
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:32,699
University of Quinte

2595
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:34,980
um university of Napoli and uh Folks at

2596
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:37,260
UC San Diego

2597
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:39,000
um this work

2598
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,280
um primary author of which is Matthias

2599
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,440
who couldn't make it today

2600
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,619
so I'm presenting on his behalf so

2601
01:44:46,619 --> 01:44:49,440
um this this paper appeared a few a few

2602
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,179
weeks ago at IMC

2603
01:44:51,179 --> 01:44:53,580
um it's titled where are you assessing

2604
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:55,739
the impact of conflict on Russian domain

2605
01:44:55,739 --> 01:44:57,239
infrastructure

2606
01:44:57,239 --> 01:44:59,940
so to set up some context

2607
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:01,560
um of course when we say we are

2608
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:03,719
assessing the conflict uh we we are

2609
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:06,420
talking about the recent invasion of uh

2610
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:08,820
the Russian invasion of Ukraine which

2611
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:11,219
produced a strong Global Response and

2612
01:45:11,219 --> 01:45:14,340
primarily uh this response included

2613
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:17,159
Western countries imposing sanctions

2614
01:45:17,159 --> 01:45:19,860
broad economic sanctions on Russian

2615
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:22,500
institutions and among certain other

2616
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:23,340
things

2617
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:25,920
and in addition to uh government per

2618
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,560
sanctions there were also some action

2619
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,560
from private sector companies uh whose

2620
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:35,040
uh self-imposed uh like restricted uh or

2621
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:38,219
even exited the Russian market and of

2622
01:45:38,219 --> 01:45:40,920
course the internet is very much part of

2623
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:43,260
the economy and like the internet did

2624
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,300
not escape this conflict

2625
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:46,500
um and

2626
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,380
what we like

2627
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:52,320
a concrete example of this is that

2628
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,420
corporate Russian websites including

2629
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:57,659
Banks uh where on the US ofac which is

2630
01:45:57,659 --> 01:45:59,900
the office of foreign asset control

2631
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:02,940
special designated

2632
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:07,199
yeah Nationals yep okay I looked it up

2633
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:09,420
before and I promptly forgot

2634
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:12,000
um uh on the yeah so like basically this

2635
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,320
is where like this is the list of

2636
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:15,179
individuals that you're not supposed to

2637
01:46:15,179 --> 01:46:19,980
and have economic activity with and um

2638
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,540
also at the same time like internet

2639
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:24,780
service companies where uh sort of as a

2640
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:27,260
result of these sanctions are um

2641
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:29,940
independently uh deciding to disengage

2642
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,520
from the Russian market for a variety of

2643
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,199
reasons

2644
01:46:34,199 --> 01:46:36,420
and while there is this push that's

2645
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:38,520
happening from as a result of sanctions

2646
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,020
there is also

2647
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:42,480
um this other aspect the pull from

2648
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,639
um Russia's long-haired concerns about

2649
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:47,699
uh internet sovereignty and uh this has

2650
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:51,719
been a long going effort and we see some

2651
01:46:51,719 --> 01:46:54,119
um recent activity recent push from

2652
01:46:54,119 --> 01:46:56,040
Russian authorities saying that they

2653
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,260
want all state-owned websites to sort of

2654
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,659
switch to domestic providers and of

2655
01:47:00,659 --> 01:47:02,880
course there is also the troubling new

2656
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,100
development of like the ministry of

2657
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:07,260
digital development sort of having their

2658
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:10,139
own Russian root CA which is

2659
01:47:10,139 --> 01:47:12,119
um which is for now only trusted by

2660
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:14,880
Russian browsers but what will not agree

2661
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,080
to a normal CT knobs

2662
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:22,380
so giving all of this context our goal

2663
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:24,659
was to sort of look at this push and

2664
01:47:24,659 --> 01:47:27,480
pull that happen as a result of

2665
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:29,760
um economic sanctions at the same time

2666
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,480
uh Russian repatriation efforts and sort

2667
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,340
of put it put all of this on an

2668
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:37,020
empirical footing we wanted to sort of

2669
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:38,340
look at

2670
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:40,080
um the DNS infrastructure and

2671
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,380
specifically where the

2672
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:44,400
authoritative name servers are located

2673
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,460
the hosting and the certification so

2674
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,820
sort of um look at how the conflict the

2675
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:52,980
sanctions and also like efforts from

2676
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:55,860
Russia itself uh to pre-patriate

2677
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:58,500
infrastructure has worked out

2678
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:02,580
and in order to do that we look at a

2679
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:04,739
couple of data sources the first and the

2680
01:48:04,739 --> 01:48:07,440
primary data source is the DNS so the

2681
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,960
folks over at University of 20 uh run

2682
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:11,940
the open rental project and as part of

2683
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:12,780
it

2684
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:15,719
um they had access to the dot Ru and the

2685
01:48:15,719 --> 01:48:17,400
dot RF

2686
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:20,219
um zones uh for a long time for a period

2687
01:48:20,219 --> 01:48:24,300
of five years and I think for reasons

2688
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:26,520
unrelated to this

2689
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:29,219
um to this paper uh this access to the

2690
01:48:29,219 --> 01:48:31,800
Zone got revoked but uh suffice to say

2691
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,440
we have like plenty of data to look at

2692
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,260
and uh starting in 2017. so well before

2693
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:39,360
the conflict started we have some

2694
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,820
insight into uh what the dot are you

2695
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:44,520
Zone has looked like over time

2696
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:47,400
the second thing we look at uh is the

2697
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:50,580
TLs landscape so basically looking at uh

2698
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:53,100
the certificate issuance uh for the

2699
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:55,080
Russian Federation domain name so dot Ru

2700
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,659
and Dot RF again uh and doing so

2701
01:48:57,659 --> 01:48:59,699
longitudinally we look at historic City

2702
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:02,460
logs and also active scans

2703
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:05,219
um using active scan data so basically

2704
01:49:05,219 --> 01:49:09,239
um from census which does a global ipv

2705
01:49:09,239 --> 01:49:11,880
first scan looking for certificates

2706
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:13,679
um that were issued

2707
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:16,380
and this is primarily to study

2708
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:19,139
um the Russian root CA and of course we

2709
01:49:19,139 --> 01:49:21,960
look for geolocation ipga location and

2710
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:24,840
some of the sanction domain lists

2711
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,880
so before we start looking at some of

2712
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,820
the results I just wanted to sort of go

2713
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:32,340
through some of the definitions we have

2714
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:35,100
um and I know like some of this is

2715
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,119
um

2716
01:49:36,119 --> 01:49:38,639
can be confusing but pre-conflict would

2717
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:41,940
be before uh February 24th uh post

2718
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:43,980
sanctions is basically when the economic

2719
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:45,900
sanctions came into effect and that

2720
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:47,760
there was this period of a month where

2721
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,880
uh the sanctions were sort of uh

2722
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,980
announced but had not come into effect

2723
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:55,199
so uh those are the three time periods

2724
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,179
that we sort of break all of our data

2725
01:49:57,179 --> 01:49:59,760
down into and for each of these

2726
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,940
compositions we say we ask whether the

2727
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:04,639
infrastructure is fully Russian

2728
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:06,900
non-russian or part Russian and

2729
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:09,900
essentially it has to do with

2730
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,340
um the fact that

2731
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:13,860
whether all of the IP addresses that are

2732
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:15,780
associated with the the infrastructure

2733
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:19,080
are either in Russia not in Russia or

2734
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,840
partly in Russia and we do a similar

2735
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,000
thing for DNS infrastructure and in that

2736
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,340
case the IP address of the authoritative

2737
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:28,800
name server is what we consider

2738
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:32,520
okay so uh so when we look at hosting

2739
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:35,520
um we like we start by looking at 2017

2740
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,219
and we already see like a lot of the

2741
01:50:38,219 --> 01:50:40,679
infrastructure is actually fully Russian

2742
01:50:40,679 --> 01:50:41,880
so

2743
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:44,639
um even prior to the conflict like as

2744
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:47,520
part of the Russian internet sovereignty

2745
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,400
app

2746
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:52,199
a lot of the infrastructure is actually

2747
01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:55,020
fully Russian so 71 percent is fully

2748
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,060
Russian and it just shows a slight

2749
01:50:57,060 --> 01:51:00,480
increase after the Innovation and um and

2750
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,400
and essentially what we think is that

2751
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,820
this is a manifestation of like a long

2752
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,139
series of

2753
01:51:07,139 --> 01:51:10,199
efforts by Russia to actually move uh

2754
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:13,380
hosting over and if you were to sort of

2755
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:16,199
look at it uh longitudinally like we

2756
01:51:16,199 --> 01:51:19,679
would see like a minor change that

2757
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:22,320
happens post-conflict where like roughly

2758
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:25,679
seven percent of the um

2759
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,440
the infrastructure sort of moves over to

2760
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:31,020
being fully Russian from being a partly

2761
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:33,780
Russian and this is primarily because of

2762
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:36,000
one infrastructure provider net naught

2763
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,139
sort of

2764
01:51:37,139 --> 01:51:42,560
um uh cutting ties with Ru Center

2765
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:45,719
if we were to look at the hosting

2766
01:51:45,719 --> 01:51:47,520
Network so basically

2767
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:51,179
um like all of the hosting providers you

2768
01:51:51,179 --> 01:51:53,580
see that most of them are pretty stable

2769
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:55,679
so I think cloudflare made it a point to

2770
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:57,420
say uh they are going to be stay in

2771
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:59,760
Russia and like and you can sort of see

2772
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:03,600
that we see Amazon sort of flip-flopping

2773
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:06,780
and I think Cedar is the one where we

2774
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:09,960
see a clear we see some flip flop but at

2775
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,820
the end of it they have exited the

2776
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:14,280
market and I think we have some crafts

2777
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:17,000
later to show

2778
01:52:17,219 --> 01:52:19,219
um

2779
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:23,040
yeah what this is yeah so like the

2780
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,020
looking at just the sanctioned domain so

2781
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:27,840
list of like the 110 uh sanctioned

2782
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:31,679
domains in the US ofac and UK lists uh

2783
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:34,440
we see like perhaps the most significant

2784
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:37,440
change but this is primarily because

2785
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:40,380
again net nard decided to cut ties with

2786
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:42,960
audio center and as a result

2787
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,820
um a lot of the the sanctioned domains

2788
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:47,159
moved from being partly Russian to like

2789
01:52:47,159 --> 01:52:49,860
fully Russian so essentially they had to

2790
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:51,960
repatriate as a result so like you can

2791
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:55,320
essentially see most of the sanctioned

2792
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,639
domains

2793
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:59,659
sort of move

2794
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:03,900
um this is the cedo example and on March

2795
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,520
9th Cedar announced that they were

2796
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:08,100
pulling the plug and

2797
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:10,139
um and like a couple of months later we

2798
01:53:10,139 --> 01:53:13,199
can see that essentially they had in

2799
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:16,139
effect pulled the plug 98 of the domains

2800
01:53:16,139 --> 01:53:18,420
had relocated and we sort of talk about

2801
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:21,480
other cases Amazon has this

2802
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:24,480
um interesting Sankey diagram there

2803
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,800
where

2804
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,440
um they sort of will they won't they and

2805
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:30,060
sort of half of the domains sort of

2806
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:32,699
relocate but half of them don't and it's

2807
01:53:32,699 --> 01:53:35,280
not and actually they also onboard a few

2808
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:37,619
new customers so we aren't entirely sure

2809
01:53:37,619 --> 01:53:40,380
what's going on there but for in

2810
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:41,940
interest of time you're not sort of

2811
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:44,219
going there

2812
01:53:44,219 --> 01:53:47,040
okay so I think uh that brings us to the

2813
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:48,960
webpk stuff which I think is the most

2814
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,400
interesting part of all of this because

2815
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,860
it sort of highlights an area that I

2816
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:55,380
think the Russian sovereignty uh project

2817
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:57,960
we did not think about

2818
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:59,760
um so again we are looking at the

2819
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,219
pre-conflict post-sanctions and the

2820
01:54:02,219 --> 01:54:04,679
pre-sanctions uh period and you can see

2821
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:07,320
like the utter domination of let's

2822
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,600
encrypt now like it has gone from being

2823
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:11,540
91 to like

2824
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:13,860
99.23 percent

2825
01:54:13,860 --> 01:54:16,020
um and there used to be this long tail

2826
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:18,420
of certificate authorities sort of

2827
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:21,000
working with DOT audio domain and that

2828
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,159
has all but disappeared

2829
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:26,420
and um

2830
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:29,040
like if you look at the number of

2831
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:32,159
certificate issuances uh over time

2832
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:34,679
um in the in the period around the uh

2833
01:54:34,679 --> 01:54:36,960
around the start of conflict uh we see

2834
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:38,699
that nearly all of the certificate

2835
01:54:38,699 --> 01:54:41,280
authorities uh stop issuing certificates

2836
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,920
a few weeks after the conflict starts

2837
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:47,460
and essentially uh as seen before like

2838
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:49,320
there are only a couple of CAS that are

2839
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:50,400
left

2840
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,440
um what was interesting to us was like

2841
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:54,480
Global Science sort of jumps into the

2842
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:57,179
top three and I think we found this on

2843
01:54:57,179 --> 01:54:59,760
the nick.ru website which essentially

2844
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,860
says oh like if you're being sanctioned

2845
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,800
uh go use Global sign which is a

2846
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,199
Japanese certificate Authority

2847
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:09,840
um so that you don't get affected by

2848
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,840
like they are not subjective sanctions

2849
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:15,239
but

2850
01:55:15,239 --> 01:55:17,280
like as an aside the Department of

2851
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,920
Treasury also put out

2852
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:22,320
a clarification saying

2853
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,639
um certificate internet services

2854
01:55:23,639 --> 01:55:26,699
companies are sort of exempt from

2855
01:55:26,699 --> 01:55:29,940
um the sanctions so um

2856
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:32,400
yeah

2857
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:35,760
okay so looking at uh the revocation uh

2858
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,920
we used the certificate revocation list

2859
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:40,380
or CSP status to sort of look at

2860
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:44,460
revocations and um like it's essentially

2861
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:46,080
a mixed bag here

2862
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:50,340
um but what we can see is digicert and

2863
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:52,940
sec2go being like very particular about

2864
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:55,679
sanctioned domains and though in general

2865
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:57,119
we see

2866
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:59,760
um higher revocation rates for the

2867
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,880
sanctioned domains uh it almost

2868
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,800
um like in the period if you sort of

2869
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,040
plot it on a longitudinal axis which I

2870
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,679
don't do here but if you look at it like

2871
01:56:10,679 --> 01:56:12,719
there is this period where certificate

2872
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:15,119
authorities aren't really sure as to how

2873
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:18,360
to handle it and we suspect that there

2874
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:21,119
is a lot of manual uh revocation

2875
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:23,760
activity going on as a certificate

2876
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,980
authorities sort of try to Grapple with

2877
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,360
the fact like how do they handle

2878
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,980
sanctioned domains

2879
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:31,260
um and like before the clarification

2880
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:33,960
Department it came out that was a lot of

2881
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:36,960
Are We affected not are we not affected

2882
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,639
are we subject to sanctions not subject

2883
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:40,560
to sanctions so uh there was a little

2884
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,900
bit of that

2885
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:44,820
um the other interesting analysis that

2886
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:47,400
we looked at was to look for the Russian

2887
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:51,360
trusted root CA now um of course uh as

2888
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,639
part of this announcement like they do

2889
01:56:53,639 --> 01:56:54,420
not

2890
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:57,600
record uh any like any certificates that

2891
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:59,460
are issued by Russian trusted root CAA

2892
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,440
do not appear in City logs so we had

2893
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:03,719
this question like what are the kind of

2894
01:57:03,719 --> 01:57:06,060
certificates are they uh are they

2895
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:08,520
issuing and is there a way to sort of go

2896
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,380
look for that and that this is where we

2897
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:13,800
use the active scan data we sort of look

2898
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:16,980
for uh certificates that Trace their

2899
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:19,619
Authority back to this Russian trust

2900
01:57:19,619 --> 01:57:20,880
recruit CA

2901
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:23,880
and we find that at least

2902
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:25,980
from like the publicly observable

2903
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:28,800
internet uh IPS like we don't really see

2904
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,940
a lot of domains like we see 170 domains

2905
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:35,460
um that are secured by the CA and nearly

2906
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:39,599
all of them are Russian related entities

2907
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:40,380
um

2908
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:43,500
a lot of the sanction domains are

2909
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,520
um

2910
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:47,880
uh secured by this uh trusted root Cas

2911
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:51,000
but essentially uh what we find is that

2912
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,400
there is very low uptake and especially

2913
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,380
compared to Let's encrypt like everyone

2914
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:59,580
sort of had their has a Russian trusted

2915
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:02,340
root CA but it seems to now prefer using

2916
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:05,119
let's encrypt

2917
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:07,980
okay and with that I think I'd like to

2918
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:10,080
sort of wrap up uh we have two minutes

2919
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:11,280
out so

2920
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,960
um

2921
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:16,440
we find that uh we put all of uh all of

2922
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:18,119
the recent events on an empirical

2923
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:20,340
footing sort of assessing the uh effect

2924
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:22,500
of uh the conflict on the Russian

2925
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:25,500
infrastructure we find that uh a lot of

2926
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:27,960
the the repatriation has already

2927
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:30,239
happened on the DNS infrastructure and

2928
01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:33,659
the hosting side and uh these we we note

2929
01:58:33,659 --> 01:58:35,760
that the certifications is like perhaps

2930
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:38,099
one area significant exposure like the

2931
01:58:38,099 --> 01:58:39,599
near complete domination of let's

2932
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:42,060
encrypt is actually was quite surprising

2933
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:44,040
to us and

2934
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,739
um like given that let's encrypt has a

2935
01:58:46,739 --> 01:58:48,599
public Mission but is also a U.S entity

2936
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:51,119
sort of highlights uh an interesting

2937
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:53,820
conundrum for them and also is

2938
01:58:53,820 --> 01:58:56,219
interestingly like is one area that

2939
01:58:56,219 --> 01:58:59,520
Russia seems to not have anticipated uh

2940
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,440
by establishing domestic Cas and those

2941
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,239
relationships beforehand which they seem

2942
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:04,619
to have done for a lot of the other

2943
01:59:04,619 --> 01:59:06,540
infrastructure

2944
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:09,300
and with that I think I'm happy to take

2945
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:11,540
questions

2946
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:14,580
real quick question because we only have

2947
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:16,380
like 30 seconds or so so we talk about

2948
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:17,880
this pre-existing domestic provisioning

2949
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,500
which is like 70 of conflict start and

2950
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:21,840
you said it was close to 70 to data sets

2951
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,340
start right there wasn't a whole lot of

2952
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:25,020
move in the front of that yeah I'm

2953
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:26,820
wondering if you have some way to

2954
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:29,880
differentiate you know a country having

2955
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:32,580
a drive toward internet sovereignty from

2956
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:34,080
a bunch of people who speak the same

2957
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,460
language and do business with each other

2958
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:37,560
in a not very globally

2959
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:39,900
um popular currency tending to have

2960
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:41,699
domestic Supply chains I have no idea

2961
01:59:41,699 --> 01:59:42,719
how to do this but it would be really

2962
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:44,699
interesting to try and measure the

2963
01:59:44,699 --> 01:59:47,400
impact of a centralized governmental

2964
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:48,719
drive toward internet sovereignty and

2965
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:50,040
I'm wondering if you have any sort of

2966
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:51,659
insights on that

2967
01:59:51,659 --> 01:59:54,239
yeah so um I guess what you're

2968
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:56,699
suggesting is can we look at

2969
01:59:56,699 --> 01:59:58,560
um how different is dot are you from

2970
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:01,139
let's say other countries and is this an

2971
02:00:01,139 --> 02:00:02,820
anomaly or something like that we have

2972
02:00:02,820 --> 02:00:05,040
like a language a language thing right

2973
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,840
uh and we haven't looked at that

2974
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:09,000
primarily because it's like really hard

2975
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,580
to get a lot of the cctlds to do this

2976
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:14,520
analysis on a long-term basis

2977
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:17,820
um and if if it were possible I think

2978
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:19,380
that would be uh that would be something

2979
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:21,060
that we would be interested in yeah sort

2980
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:22,860
of looking at it longitudinally and

2981
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:24,780
might be something to do even a one-off

2982
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:27,060
analysis and something that we'll

2983
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:29,040
consider yeah pretty cool makes sense

2984
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:32,639
