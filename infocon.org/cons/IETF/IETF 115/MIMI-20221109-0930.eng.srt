audio and video off or the medeco light

37
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,239
icon in the data tracker that's how

38

so here's our agenda for today uh fairly

50
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,980
kind of standard boff agenda we'll bash

51
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,400
this agenda and then we'll have Rowan

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,659
who's going to present the problem

53
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,659
statement for Mimi for about 20 minutes

54
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,300
we'll have time for clarifying questions

55
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,739
only

56
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,599
um at the beginning and then we'll move

57
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,019
into discussion of the charter and and

58
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,659
the boss questions at the end and if we

59
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,879
get done in time we can start a little

60
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,560
bit of solution space discussion there's

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,900
been a lot of robust contributions on

62
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,239
the list and we're happy to use some of

63
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,799
that time to to get the solution space

64
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,780
discussion going if we if we have the

65
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,760
time left

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,379
um are there any

67
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,179
anyone who wants to bash the agenda

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,819
okay

69
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,680
um just just one additional note before

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,319
we move on can we go back on this agenda

71
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,819
um so

72
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,880
in the context of of Mimi uh we're sort

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,260
of operating

74
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,500
with you know new regulatory

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,060
requirements which are one of the

76
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,220
drivers for this work but not the only

77
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,100
driver and I just wanted to note that

78
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,320
this is not an unfamiliar situation in

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,800
the ietf we have a long history of sort

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,960
of an interaction between things that we

81
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
develop and the broader regulatory

82
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,400
environment especially in the in the in

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,900
the Telco space and Telecommunications

84
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,720
space with things like stir and ecrit

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,100
and so on

86
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,080
um so this is not new for us

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,520
um it's you know something that we've

88
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,220
done before and we can we can think

89
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,320
about uh what the regulatory

90
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,759
requirements are but really what we're

91
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,340
mostly focused on is developing the best

92
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,759
solutions for the internet and its users

93
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,040
next

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,180
um there were a bunch of drafts that

95
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,280
were submitted in advance of the boff

96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,960
we're not going to be doing you know

97
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,419
individual draft presentations today but

98
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,040
if you want to familiarize yourself with

99
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,320
what was submitted um there's a list in

100
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,180
the slide and also in the data tracker

101
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,280
if you want to take a look at how people

102
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,540
are starting to approach the different

103
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,960
topics

104
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,800
um and this is for later so we can kick

105
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,300
it over to Rowan

106
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,580
hi everybody

107
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,600
we're getting there so while we're

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,280
waiting just out of curiosity how many

109
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,780
people here have read the problem

110
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,500
statement draft

111
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,580
okay good

112
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,020
good all right so the way I'm gonna

113
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,400
start

114
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,400
um sort of organizing the problem

115
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,720
statement topics uh for lack of a better

116
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,600
way of doing it I'm starting sort of

117
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,020
from the the highest level of the seven

118
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,479
layer stack not the nine letter stack

119
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,240
but the seven layer stack uh and moving

120
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,639
on from there

121
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,960
uh

122
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,180
I'll also just sort of give a background

123
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,220
for anyone who didn't

124
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,840
um

125
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,100
who didn't read the uh the buff proposal

126
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,800
um so there's them quite a bit of

127
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,900
motivation for why we're doing this and

128
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,280
many of the questions that I have been

129
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
asked by people who were not involved

130
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,319
had to do with

131
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,819
you did this

132
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,380
many years ago why are you doing this

133
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,759
again

134
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,240
so um okay the chairs asked me to add

135
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,259
one one uh slide with that which

136
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,880
hopefully will be non-controversial and

137
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,080
we can move on to the rest of the

138
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,580
problem statement

139
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,639
okay there's something

140
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,800
we will now

141
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,520
do this

142
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,900
how about that

143
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,180
that work for you yeah okay we'll do it

144
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,979
that way yeah

145
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,120
yeah next slide please

146
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,919
yeah

147
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,500
it takes longer this way okay

148
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,780
uh yeah so

149
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,259
today instant messaging is widespread

150
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,099
uh it's got lots of features it's indent

151
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,080
encrypted for the most part

152
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,819
and

153
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,919
um the experience of trying to figure

154
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,720
out how you

155
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,580
how you send an instant message to

156
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,280
someone else for the first time is uh

157
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,400
pretty pathetic uh like oh are you on

158
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,699
Signal no what's up oh yeah wire no yeah

159
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,580
and then you know you have to have

160
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,620
several applications running on on your

161
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,639
device

162
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,280
and you still might not be able to

163
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,340
communicate right away

164
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,380
this lack of interoperability causes a

165
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,379
very poor user experience and

166
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,160
um

167
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,900
so what's different from last time well

168
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,120
last time uh

169
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,819
instant messaging was still pretty basic

170
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,599
so the feature experience now what's the

171
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,399
the sort of common set of features among

172
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,260
instant Messengers is is quite robust

173
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,599
and uh we didn't have widespread indent

174
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,000
encryption before and now there's a lot

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,160
of external pressure

176
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,320
um for example from the EU digital

177
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,120
markets act in order for us to have

178
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,800
interoperability

179
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,740
so we could

180
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,040
achieve slowly bit by bit

181
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,560
interoperability by just letting

182
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,480
individual vendors publish their apis

183
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,959
without standardization but this would

184
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,600
this would perpetuate the status quo we

185
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,459
would end up with probably some pretty

186
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,440
poor

187
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,640
uh user experiences and lots of bugs

188
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,339
so the theory behind Mimi is that having

189
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,779
a minimal standardized framework and

190
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,240
that allows for

191
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,620
interoperability but still allows

192
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,160
Innovation and design Decisions by

193
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,740
individual clients that was the goal

194
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,160
hearing no one screaming

195
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,719
let's start at the top of the stack

196
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,640
so if you are and then encrypting

197
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,080
you don't get to use a gateway to change

198
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,140
the contents that are end and encrypted

199
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,760
it's encrypt once and send and forget

200
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,660
you have to send it and

201
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,300
so we have a we have a number of

202
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,060
different uh things that we need to be

203
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,860
able to convey in the message format

204
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,779
that are quite common across instant

205
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,760
messaging systems

206
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,279
for example we've got both plain text

207
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,399
and Rich text messages we have replies

208
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,100
reactions mentions

209
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,220
um editing a message deleting a message

210
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,060
some Services support expiring messages

211
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,880
read and delivery receipts

212
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,220
almost everyone has links to attachments

213
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,880
images some videos and some recorded

214
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,220
sounds and then finally many have

215
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,279
support for

216
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,720
send the sort of initial bootstrap

217
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,760
message for starting a either a

218
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,920
one-on-one or a one-on-one caller or a

219
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,620
uh a conference an audio or video

220
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,880
conference

221
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,200
so

222
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,760
um

223
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,440
what's important here is that everyone

224
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,200
in the group gets the same content from

225
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,260
whoever sends content

226
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,440
um so we need at least one kind of

227
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,079
common minimal set of formats

228
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,420
but they're likely to be many formats

229
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,040
out there so if there are proprietary

230
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,220
formats you need to be able to uh

231
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,620
probably still send those and also send

232
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,480
the common format depending on their

233
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,040
circumstances so you need to communicate

234
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,500
which formats are supported which are

235
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,240
required and what is actually said

236
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,959
thank you

237
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,019
the next layer down

238
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,940
we have the actual indent encryption

239
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,579
so

240
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:52,860
we are assuming the use of the messaging

241
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,260
layer security protocol MLS

242
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,240
which was

243
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,120
developed here at ITF and it has some

244
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,360
properties which are Maybe

245
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,480
not obvious to someone who just walks in

246
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,040
the room for the first time and takes a

247
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,440
look at how do I go and encrypt my

248
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,760
messages

249
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,640
so MLS describes

250
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,820
two abstract Services an authentication

251
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,000
Service and a distribution service

252
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,320
and

253
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,820
these

254
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
in uh concept of in the context of

255
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,560
interoperability

256
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,680
a distribution service is very likely to

257
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,220
span multiple administrative domains so

258
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,399
the service isn't running on one server

259
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,680
over here and then you have you know a

260
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,639
separate

261
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,800
service to talk to the other thing the

262
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,279
the service

263
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,720
spans all of the domains that are

264
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,200
involved

265
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,200
um and it also does not specify whether

266
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,600
a particular function needs to be

267
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,320
accomplished in a client or in a server

268
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,260
so the architecture is quite flexible

269
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,860
and if you're curious about this for

270
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,540
more detail I encourage you to look at

271
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,300
the MLS architecture document linked

272
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,320
below

273
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,579
uh it describes what are the decisions

274
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,680
that an implementation needs to make

275
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,680
about how to uh

276
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,720
how uh how to deliver a compliant

277
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,820
uh authentication Service and in a

278
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,000
compliant distribution service

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,040
authentication Services need to issue

280
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,380
credentials and they need to enable a

281
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,320
client to verify that credentials that

282
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,240
they receive

283
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,200
um

284
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,139
are uh as they're presented by another

285
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,899
client uh the distribution service is

286
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,240
responsible for defining what is the

287
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,700
ordering what are the ordering rules for

288
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,139
handshake messages

289
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,260
and for routing the MLS messages

290
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,000
we also need a place to store what are

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,440
called key packages which is how you

292
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,240
initially

293
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,519
um how you get the keying material to

294
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,920
initially communicate with someone

295
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,720
and then there are a bunch of

296
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,220
administrative and policy knobs

297
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,779
uh I think you're in yeah

298
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,420
um we we Advanced yeah I doubled you

299
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,310
doubled back uh

300
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,579
[Music]

301
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,860
perfect great

302
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,220
okay one more layer down

303
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,399
so we need a way to convey

304
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,660
the encrypted messages the MLS messages

305
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,860
to a server which is sort of the

306
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,880
uh between between servers among servers

307
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,240
um and between clients and servers and

308
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,100
so the

309
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,019
um

310
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,880
we at minimum need to be able to send

311
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,380
these MLS messages

312
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,420
there may be some other features that we

313
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,380
also want to to communicate

314
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,519
um

315
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,920
using the same protocol

316
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,180
uh

317
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,800
traditionally when we're talking about

318
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
instant messaging people talk about

319
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,339
there's a server to server thing over

320
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,800
here and a client server to server thing

321
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,120
over there

322
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,639
uh

323
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,040
for for both of these we could leave

324
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
these completely undefined

325
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,880
particularly in the server-to-server

326
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,060
case

327
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,880
it would be very desirable for us to

328
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
have at least a standardized

329
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,399
description of how to do how to solve

330
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,380
this problem

331
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,160
um

332
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,560
and that would also include not just how

333
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,019
you send between two servers that are

334
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,399
would then become part of the same

335
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,320
distribution service but also how to

336
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,600
resolve that specific server for a

337
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,180
specific service

338
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,760
uh

339
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,639
in uh from the client to server protocol

340
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,899
perspective

341
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,779
so traditionally you know

342
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,760
in most instant messaging systems this

343
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,019
would be an implementation specific

344
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,860
matter but for MLS it is critically

345
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,680
important that we enumerate what the

346
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,060
requirements are

347
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,639
for the MLS profile that we're using so

348
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,620
that clients can

349
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,600
correctly comply

350
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,680
with that protocol

351
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,180
all right

352
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,480
this one is a bit subtle

353
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,199
we have

354
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,079
lots of identifiers that we use to

355
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,720
describe different

356
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,100
items

357
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,060
in instant messaging

358
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,519
three of the most important which are

359
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,720
used on basically every IM system are

360
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,380
an identifier used to describe a user

361
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,020
of the system

362
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,240
an identifier which is used to describe

363
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,559
a client

364
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,540
because in many instant in most instant

365
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,400
messaging systems you can have multiple

366
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,359
clients for the same user simultaneously

367
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,199
for example a mobile and a desktop

368
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,380
and then finally we have uh what in MLS

369
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,839
is called a group but could be called a

370
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,240
conversation a chat a channel something

371
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
else but these are all really the same

372
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,140
concept this is

373
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,760
the the

374
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,520
collection of users that I'm

375
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,020
communicating with or the collection of

376
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,460
clients that I'm communicating with

377
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,760
associated with those users

378
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,000
uh an identifier that is used internally

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,760
is not always what the end user sees in

380
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,880
a user interface so in a user interface

381
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,919
you may you may see something like that

382
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,660
looks like a phone number

383
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,000
and in fact when you search for a user

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,900
you may

385
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,880
use a phone number or an email address

386
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,880
or a full name or you may have a service

387
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,340
handle the internal identifier may be

388
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,860
different

389
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,660
as part of the problem space we just

390
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,940
need to make sure that internal

391
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,400
identifiers are compatible with the

392
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
protocols we use

393
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,740
and we should make sure as well that

394
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,480
because our goal is interoperability

395
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,919
that we're not

396
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,640
um

397
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,220
we're not putting a high barrier on an

398
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,539
existing service that they have to

399
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,100
completely change their service in order

400
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,440
to use to incorporate some identifier

401
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,460
that they already use

402
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,179
there it is

403
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,020
suspense

404
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,200
now

405
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,360
we we already are assuming that

406
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,240
end-to-end encryption is uh

407
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,419
is baked in as a first-class citizen in

408
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,100
this architecture

409
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,280
uh end-to-end encryption uh prevents

410
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,140
eavesdropping

411
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,860
but it doesn't prevent impersonation

412
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,860
and one of the largest barriers to

413
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,720
interoperability

414
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,340
is to make

415
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,260
um the administrator of a service

416
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,520
comfortable or you know assured that uh

417
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,740
that someone isn't going to impersonate

418
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,600
a user on their system or that they're

419
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,340
not going to

420
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,400
um that they're not going to end up with

421
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,340
active attacks that weaken the security

422
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,240
of their own system uh and you know one

423
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,700
of the one of the concerns there of

424
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,500
course would be spamming for example is

425
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,320
a lot easier to do if you can mint a

426
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,580
sort of an infinite number of

427
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,480
identifiers

428
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,179
so the sort of

429
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,460
overall model of how you would do

430
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,059
end-to-end identity in MLS is that you

431
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:06,539
have uh for for each client in a group

432
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,820
that you have a presenting client a

433
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,460
presenting client needs to go and get

434
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,500
some kind of credential from

435
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,539
some issuing authority

436
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,059
and then it can include that credential

437
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,340
in its MLS messages

438
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,720
and

439
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,120
any of the the clients which receive

440
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,340
that they are now in a position to

441
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,660
verify

442
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,100
that credential

443
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,400
they can verify that credential either

444
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,919
online directly or there may be an

445
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,460
offline mechanism that they can use to

446
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,720
to verify the credential

447
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,640
so this problem is just about

448
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,160
strongly associating a client with a

449
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,840
specific user identity

450
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,440
and a and other clients being able to

451
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,620
verify presented in entities

452
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,440
we want to make sure that there isn't a

453
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,080
huge proliferation of different ways of

454
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,600
doing that verification we want to have

455
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,580
one or two

456
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,320
different ways of doing that

457
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,520
verification

458
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,160
that are well defined and

459
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,100
and something that we can take to a Bake

460
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,280
Off

461
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,700
finally this stuff is uh we're

462
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,520
this is one of the the areas where we

463
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,260
assume that the actual protocol is

464
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,299
defined elsewhere that we're just saying

465
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,260
use this one

466
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,960
all right

467
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,860
so related to the identifier problem we

468
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,159
have the introduction problem

469
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,820
this is how do you get the internal

470
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,140
identifier

471
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,020
and how do you obtain permission to

472
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,240
start sending messages to someone or

473
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,059
inviting them to groups

474
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:00,780
um

475
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,940
now the first part of this assumes that

476
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,580
you know what the target service is so

477
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,340
this would be you know I I come to

478
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,700
Jonathan and I say I uh Jonathan do you

479
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,580
have uh do you have wire no do you have

480
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,740
do you have WhatsApp yes do you have

481
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,320
signal yes okay so I take the service

482
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,539
and I take the identifier that they use

483
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:22,559
and

484
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,600
I look I Look up Jonathan and then I get

485
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,679
a uh usually a uh a connection request

486
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,640
that I use to I send to him and then if

487
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,380
he accepts the connection request then

488
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,220
we can communicate

489
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,940
uh one of the requirements here is that

490
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,220
we preserve private the privacy and

491
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,240
preferences of the target

492
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,820
the second uh interesting part here is

493
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,799
discovery of the of the instant

494
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,179
messaging service

495
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,520
how do we determine what the target's

496
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,900
preferred service is

497
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,720
okay lastly

498
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,500
we have

499
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,860
some very useful things that are listed

500
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,580
on the current Charter as we can we can

501
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,620
ask to do these later

502
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,400
one of these is hooks to prevent spam

503
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,659
and abuse

504
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,140
so this is metadata for processing

505
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,520
um

506
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,820
metadata that we can use to manage spam

507
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,980
abuse like did was somebody asked to be

508
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,100
blocked was someone reported

509
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,220
um

510
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,659
I will just point out that having a

511
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,640
strong identity makes it easier to solve

512
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,140
this problem

513
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,140
um

514
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,600
and then we also have lastly the problem

515
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,780
about how you administer groups and

516
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,140
moderate groups and so if you have two

517
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,900
different systems and a system over here

518
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,659
service a invites a user who is on

519
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,100
service B

520
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,080
uh

521
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,260
we could imagine that without any

522
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,419
specification

523
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,820
this could be entirely administered and

524
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,900
moderated

525
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,740
by users in the first domain the first

526
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,960
service

527
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,840
without any standardized protocol action

528
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,460
but if you wanted to do that across

529
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,140
protocols then you would need

530
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,360
uh some kind of a standardized protocol

531
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,140
that's what I got

532
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,260
together

533
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,799
no I think you should stay you don't get

534
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,059
to sit down yet

535
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,640
because now is the time for clarifying

536
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,940
questions on the problem statement

537
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,080
Brian

538
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,220
wow I did not expect to be the first

539
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,900
person in line here

540
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,059
um so uh thanks for the presentation one

541
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,200
question that came up is we're talking

542
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,580
about sort of like client to server

543
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,080
interoperability as well as server to

544
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,640
server interoperability

545
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,140
do we have like a preferred or

546
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,220
understood preferred model for which one

547
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,860
we want to support first right like so

548
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,140
you know I am you know member of service

549
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,140
X there's service X to service y

550
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,320
interoper between those servers versus I

551
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,140
have client X and can connect to server

552
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,120
for service y to send

553
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,220
message to like

554
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,919
is this left open should we

555
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,140
am I opening the wrong can of worms too

556
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,640
early

557
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,360
um

558
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,640
let me let me just say that

559
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,340
we're not specifying a protocol unless

560
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,620
it's you know there's we we're not even

561
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,260
to that point the next step is

562
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,299
once we Grant a problem

563
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,400
once we get a working group we talk

564
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,260
about what are the requirements but

565
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,700
technically

566
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,039
if we're using MLS

567
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,880
we need the MLS clients on whatever

568
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,940
service we're interoperating with

569
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,240
to have sort of a cohesive

570
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,460
uh over uh and we need to have an

571
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,679
intersecting set of policies

572
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,120
and so the

573
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,960
the clients for example if uh

574
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,659
um to give you a simple example when I

575
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,380
remove myself from a group I send a I

576
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,960
send a proposal to remove myself someone

577
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,940
needs to commit that proposal whose

578
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,919
responsibility is to do that

579
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,039
we need to we need to have uh

580
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,860
interoperability that

581
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,500
when there's a policy that okay in this

582
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,720
particular group that's done this way

583
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,480
then the clients need to comply with

584
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,799
that

585
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,720
Okay so

586
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
I think what I'm hearing is we don't

587
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,820
know yet but there is a a strong

588
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,980
preference to use the MLS architecture

589
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,960
as a basis and that will drive

590
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,820
some of the decisions is supposed to

591
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,700
with respect to what gets done first

592
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,679
yeah cool

593
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,299
I don't want to do the whole present I

594
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:28,380
don't want to do the whole discussion

595
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,700
that was that that was the thing that I

596
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,100
was I needed to clarify so I'll sit down

597
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,840
okay

598
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,640
AJ

599
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,679
uh Hey Rowan thanks for giving this

600
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,120
presentation uh definitely kind of

601
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,980
clears up a lot of the the space that

602
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,020
we're looking at I was hoping to clarify

603
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,659
the introduction

604
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:46,860
identifying individuals inside of these

605
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,900
different groups by different protocols

606
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,580
um because I think the

607
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,860
the initial uh urge is to go for

608
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,539
something that we've seen in like an

609
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,039
email client where there's some sort of

610
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,260
identifier like you know this is some

611
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,940
user and we've got some contact system

612
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,740
that finds these other internal

613
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,140
identifiers at

614
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,779
system or service of their choice

615
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,080
I guess the difficulty

616
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,779
um what is the thought behind

617
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,760
there's we're not talking to the service

618
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,520
to Route us to this user we just need to

619
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,279
identify their device individually

620
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,260
and that message gets delivered straight

621
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,600
to them that you know devices identity

622
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,520
by IP address or where it sits in the

623
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,600
network

624
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,279
is going to be tough to tease out with

625
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,320
some sort of

626
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,539
Authority in the middle that directs us

627
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:34,520
to them

628
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,840
and trying to solve that end to end

629
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,880
versus centralizing it is going to be

630
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,120
difficult

631
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,080
um

632
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,380
okay so AJ if I if I understand your

633
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,659
your concern is that you want to make

634
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,640
sure that

635
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,960
um

636
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,320
that whatever identifier is used that it

637
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,940
can ultimately provides enough

638
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,640
information to route to the end to the

639
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,580
to the end clients

640
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,580
yeah wherever that is especially even if

641
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,620
they're not online which which can

642
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,260
change over time yeah and and you know

643
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,320
for my affiliation

644
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,360
the my employer is very you know is

645
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,460
obviously implements this as this is

646
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,380
this is part of our our product so

647
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,179
that's

648
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,520
um I'm not at all concerned that we will

649
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,799
have a problem doing that okay

650
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,200
it you think that will be implemented to

651
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,940
find a user it's by their their service

652
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,380
that they're using for this message

653
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,299
exactly okay great it would be the

654
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,100
services responsibility to deliver it to

655
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,440
them later if they're not online

656
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,000
thank you

657
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,559
Matthew

658
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,820
um hi

659
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,320
um thinking about the introduction

660
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,520
problem

661
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,440
um I realized that we might be missing

662
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,840
something from the scope here which is

663
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,480
giving the users the ability to

664
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,720
basically opt-in or out of whether they

665
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,399
are being you know linked through to

666
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,580
other services at all and there could be

667
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,580
a massive dystopia if Mimi gets this

668
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,580
wrong a bit like um gdpr cookie

669
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,640
acceptance pop-ups everywhere where

670
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,340
users they might be on Signal and say

671
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,600
we're in the future when we're in the

672
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,520
group chat and then somebody wants to

673
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,860
bring somebody on WhatsApp into that

674
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,200
group and everybody says how the whole

675
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,580
reason we're on Signal is to stop

676
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,440
Facebook getting us our data or whatever

677
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,260
you need to have some kind of semantics

678
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,340
both at the API and frankly the uxler to

679
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,700
make sure that um people can control the

680
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,740
metadata privacy within a given

681
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,960
conversation so I basically wanted to

682
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,940
flag up whether that was consciously

683
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,220
being descoped or whether it had been

684
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,440
missed because if we don't consider it

685
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,000
from the outset it feels like something

686
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,260
we could get horribly wrong

687
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,020
do you think you could rephrase the

688
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,480
problem so the problem in one sentence

689
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,860
is users should be able to select

690
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,899
um where their conversations are getting

691
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,820
interoperated with

692
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,039
so that they can maintain their own

693
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,080
metadata footprint and we need to

694
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,240
support that and Mimi okay so if I can

695
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,120
rephrase it it's not that the user can

696
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,299
the user can do something that the user

697
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:18,720
has a certain set of policy policies

698
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,260
that their service uh

699
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,020
requires about metadata

700
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,760
and that that policy is enforced

701
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,399
or I don't know if it's not that that

702
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,860
the user is informed

703
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,080
yes so be it's on a kind of conversation

704
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,080
by conversation basis okay I I think

705
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,539
that the current text actually covers

706
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:43,860
that

707
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,240
um

708
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,100
foreign

709
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,100
dude

710
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,419
is that a rebel call

711
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,059
was that a robocall I said that was the

712
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,899
that was the DMV

713
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,159
so yeah I think that the current text

714
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,100
actually covers that under the

715
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,020
um the

716
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,360
in the introduction paragraph there are

717
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,899
some some text about that but do you

718
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,279
want to cover that when we actually look

719
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:17,100
yeah if you could between now and when

720
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,360
we start talking about the charter look

721
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,799
there's a line in the charter about

722
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,559
respect respecting expressed user

723
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,179
preferences about reachability and

724
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,340
discoverability and see if you think it

725
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,520
captures this bit as well about kind of

726
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,580
where the metadata is located okay thank

727
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,760
you

728
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,880
in this case since people are did you

729
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,260
decide who has to join a group you could

730
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,760
be like I don't like people who have you

731
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,799
know at

732
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,059
whatsapp.com in the back

733
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:46,140
um so I want to tell you the instruction

734
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,460
problem just a minute and try to sharpen

735
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,080
up I think what what the requirements

736
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,640
are so there's either three layers of

737
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,620
requirements uh things you might imagine

738
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,880
doing right

739
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,539
um

740
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,700
at the very top I started the very most

741
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,159
most powerful would be to say that um

742
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:00,539
you know you could have I think what

743
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:02,820
Jonathan's draft calls um calls a a

744
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,279
service specific identifiers um you know

745
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,020
um things like you know unqualified

746
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,179
names like at Ecker and be able to

747
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:10,860
figure out like which service they were

748
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,919
on yeah or e164 numbers you know which

749
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,720
what spin residue

750
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,399
um the sort of next level down which I

751
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:18,960
think you're trying to roll out of scope

752
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,539
um the next level down is

753
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:22,799
um to be able to have you know whether

754
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,200
they're hidden or unhidden qualified

755
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,640
identifiers in the same you know like

756
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,380
RFC 22 names

757
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,880
um and the idea would be so you know it

758
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,200
might be the case you know so now the

759
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
interfaces might be presented as you

760
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,539
know as ekr at you know at wire but like

761
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,100
theoretically but the point would be

762
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,399
that um uh that given those things is an

763
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,260
unambiguous way to figure out what

764
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,360
exactly what services that that requires

765
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,519
connecting to right for the internal

766
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,100
identifiers yeah so so if I'm giving an

767
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,659
internal Journal identifier the scoping

768
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,640
parameter this is what services on

769
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,000
um that on what so I mean I guess so so

770
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,159
an email like in um in an email system

771
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,299
right

772
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:00,840
um

773
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,580
um on you know you can email names are

774
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,720
one giant string but you can imagine

775
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,620
them being on this way you imagine

776
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,360
saying you know um you know here and

777
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,219
then you know example.com as like as

778
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,080
they identifier um my point is there's a

779
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,460
single algorithm you follow to figure

780
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,639
out where that server lives right and

781
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,980
then there's like

782
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,719
um and then it's like a an even worse

783
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,580
thing which is you have to maintain a

784
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,679
table that is not like generically

785
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,418
lookable it tells you what's up is over

786
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,239
here and it goes over here and um and in

787
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,260
fact like you know there's different

788
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,399
things you have to do to connect you to

789
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,899
them I assume that we want the middle

790
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,300
one not the last one right

791
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,040
that is there's there's a single hour

792
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,179
set of algorithm and community and

793
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,918
communication protocols they do not

794
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:38,940
require you to maintain a specialized

795
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,219
table for each kind of party service

796
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,500
so I think that in terms of the problem

797
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,000
statement I don't think we need to

798
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,199
decide that I think that's a

799
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,560
requirements question but you know I I

800
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,440
think it I think that that as if when

801
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,418
present when presented specifically

802
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:56,940
explicitly I think that the The Logical

803
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,619
conclusion will be fairly obvious for

804
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:00,119
that question I would hope so I'm just

805
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,260
trying to like okay so I'm happy to

806
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,580
defer this conversation but I think that

807
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,080
it is part of it that seems part of the

808
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,000
problem otherwise we don't get very far

809
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,960
um

810
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,040
um

811
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,099
so I I think uh so I think yeah all

812
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,800
different requirements

813
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,880
Jim

814
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,560
uh Jim Fenton

815
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,540
um I've got a slew of questions about

816
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,280
identifiers and I'm not going to ask now

817
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,420
because I think we're covering that

818
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,920
pretty well

819
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,900
um the thing that confused me was toward

820
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,220
the end you were talking about the need

821
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,000
to understand what service a particular

822
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,280
user uses are they on wire are they on

823
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,980
Signal or are they on WhatsApp or what

824
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,780
Etc

825
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,900
what confuses me is that if

826
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,180
um if these services are you know become

827
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,520
interoperable through this

828
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,560
why do you need to know they

829
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,599
interoperate

830
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,820
um so if

831
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,000
if I have a friend who only has an

832
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,220
account on

833
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,140
mask on

834
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,980
okay then I need you know I need to

835
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,099
somehow I can't just you know

836
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,780
I

837
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,940
I need to be able to from and I'm not

838
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,160
using if I'm not using that system I

839
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,500
need to be able to provide some

840
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,480
information so that

841
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,660
I can I can start the process and start

842
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,000
routing messages send my user

843
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,660
introduction to the correct service to

844
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,480
start the ball the ball rolling so so

845
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,060
maybe my confusion is that you're saying

846
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,859
the system needs to understand that that

847
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,240
isn't the concern of the users anymore

848
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,859
then

849
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,079
is it the user or the or the system that

850
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,660
needs to understand what services if you

851
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,380
so the second problem is that if you

852
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,300
have let's say

853
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,940
that some something to search on

854
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,460
like an email address or a phone number

855
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,200
or

856
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,720
a full name and some other information

857
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,720
say that you could

858
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,099
um

859
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,020
that you could

860
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,540
optionally with the user with the target

861
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,000
user's consent that you could use that

862
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,160
to figure out here are some services

863
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,020
that I'm on and sort of the preferred

864
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,359
order of them

865
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,000
like and I'm that's I'm not trying to be

866
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,339
specific about how you would do that

867
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:21,000
there are a lot of privacy issues blah

868
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,099
blah blah blah but

869
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,980
if that system existed you could check

870
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,720
it if the person you were trying to

871
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,280
contact

872
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,220
agreed to publish information on that

873
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,400
system then you could go and say ah I

874
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,839
know they're on Mastodon I'm going to

875
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,060
try this user on Mastodon

876
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,380
uh

877
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,960
the first problem is that if I

878
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,500
explicitly said yeah I want to contact

879
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,800
uh you know Raphael on Signal with this

880
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,119
identifier

881
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,680
that

882
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,359
even though I you know even though I'm

883
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:55,880
not using a signal

884
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,300
uh a signal client that I would be able

885
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,380
to contact and interoperate with Raphael

886
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,540
on signal I guess I guess my question

887
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,119
then is do you have to say you want to

888
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,280
contact Rafael on Signal or do you just

889
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,960
have do you just say I want to contact

890
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,320
Raphael and the system

891
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,140
so the two the two things on that slide

892
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,440
the first one is I need to say Raphael

893
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,180
and I'm contacting him on Signal the

894
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,220
second one is that there could be a

895
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,619
service that I could ask

896
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,140
what is Rapha what services does Rafael

897
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,839
have what services does what service

898
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,680
does Raphael prefer to be contacted on

899
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,680
okay I I I've just confirmed that this

900
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,200
is a point of convention and so yeah

901
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,000
yeah I think for the purposes of the

902
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,520
problem statement the problem is being

903
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,980
stated as functionally you have a you

904
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,200
have a Target identifier and what you

905
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,420
need to be able to do is bootstrap a

906
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,520
communication with that identifier on

907
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,579
their service and the area that needs to

908
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:03,780
be explored

909
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,780
in the design space is around how do you

910
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,700
do that is it at the user level or the

911
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,160
system level does it leverage you know

912
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,500
some side service on the side to help

913
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,359
you do that those are like questions

914
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,160
about the solution as opposed to the

915
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,339
problem

916
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,099
and Europe Ben Campbell so Rowan I

917
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:24,599
apologize because I've already asked you

918
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,040
this but I was going to ask it in the

919
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,260
bigger group uh

920
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,660
notably absent on your list of example

921
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,940
identifiers or telephone numbers

922
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,060
so no no the phone number was it was

923
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,700
second item on the on the slide it was

924
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,560
on the slide it wasn't the identity it

925
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,160
wasn't was it in the identity draft

926
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,760
uh it was it was in the in the problem

927
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,740
statement and it was

928
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,440
in yeah on the problem statement and in

929
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,599
the

930
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,460
um

931
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,720
yeah it was in the problem statement

932
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,880
okay I completely missed that so I

933
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,980
apologize

934
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,480
you can say something about it if you

935
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,880
want to but you don't have to

936
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,500
uh so we're going to be closing the

937
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,820
queue for clarifying questions

938
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,339
momentarily so if you need to get in it

939
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,200
please do so now

940
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,000
hello hansier couple

941
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,520
um I understood so this is basically

942
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,260
about interoperability operability

943
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,020
driven by the digital markets act and

944
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,000
you know the desire to make clients

945
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,640
inoperable so my question would be

946
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,099
um does it also include in a way a

947
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,839
portability according to the gdpr

948
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:32,339
article 20

949
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,380
because the reason I ask is I think

950
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,359
there's quite some overlap for instance

951
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,820
in the data model and so on but there

952
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,099
might be subtle differences as well to

953
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,859
think about so just to illustrate it a

954
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,020
little bit in my observation is that in

955
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,300
many ITF

956
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,680
protocols for instance like the

957
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,560
calendaring invite

958
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,839
rfcs in the initial design they are much

959
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,359
more focused on interoperability

960
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,040
um but you have problems later on with

961
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,079
portability for instance you had these

962
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,000
invites or receipts you sent on an

963
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,380
invite

964
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,820
um to a certain user when you invite to

965
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,160
an invent event which is fine for live

966
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,560
indoor probability but if you later on

967
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,599
like 10 years later or so move people

968
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,300
away to another provider you wanna put

969
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,160
the data but you don't want to resend

970
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,020
those invites so you have a certain

971
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,480
class of a problem which doesn't occur

972
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,280
in life interoperability but is

973
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,560
portability relevant and I wonder if

974
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,180
this is also supposed to be in the scope

975
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,200
of the proposal and of the working group

976
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,339
um

977
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:33,900
so

978
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,520
I'm just going to go out on a limb here

979
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,660
and say

980
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,640
I think that's an interesting problem to

981
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,440
solve but I don't think it's in scope

982
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,440
and it's by my read it's not required by

983
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,000
the dma

984
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,920
yeah but by something like gdpr so the

985
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,220
question would be is it mainly dma

986
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,579
um driven or so that it's

987
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,119
whether it's required to be done in an

988
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,920
interoperable way okay

989
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,920
I don't see any regulatory requirement

990
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,280
to do that interesting problem not not

991
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,099
currently what I'm considering as part

992
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,260
of this scope we got we got a big scope

993
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,119
right now so

994
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,980
thank you

995
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,579
Harold

996
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,160
hello this Jim

997
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,160
um I had an elephant just wondered in

998
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,079
through the room in my head

999
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:28,680
uh presence

1000
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,119
and

1001
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,060
this proposal never talks about the

1002
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,099
presence

1003
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,220
and every single

1004
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,339
a messaging system I've dealt with has a

1005
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:42,780
support for presence

1006
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,480
and every single messaging system I've

1007
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,119
been involved with on the server side

1008
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:50,220
has had major scaling problems because

1009
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,140
of presence

1010
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,540
so is this something that you really

1011
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,940
want to leave out of scope or is it is

1012
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,680
this something we need to have a deep

1013
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,940
architectural discussion about

1014
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,760
you can give your opinion

1015
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,079
you're entitled to your opinion that if

1016
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,760
you if your opinion is that we need to

1017
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,740
have it

1018
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,020
that's your opinion we could ask what's

1019
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,520
your own's opinion

1020
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,220
uh my opinion is that

1021
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,819
um

1022
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:19,680
most people ignore it

1023
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,319
now because it wasn't implemented very

1024
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,759
well in most messaging systems

1025
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,979
[Music]

1026
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,420
okay I was pointed out that SMS and I

1027
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,940
and iMessage doesn't have a presence I

1028
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,740
have not used those for those things

1029
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:50,359
so so I I think we need to need to

1030
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:53,099
consider this and either really totally

1031
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,680
out of scope or architect our solutions

1032
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,399
to support it

1033
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,760
so uh in in the presentation I saw

1034
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,480
mention of end-to-end security

1035
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,220
and

1036
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,619
just encrypting the messages is not

1037
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,720
end-to-end security

1038
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,119
not unless you've got end-to-end

1039
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,540
security of the keys

1040
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,579
and I think it's important to make make

1041
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,280
that point because if I exchange my

1042
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,380
contact information with Alyssa

1043
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,140
it makes a huge difference if I've got

1044
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,740
illiter's public key in my contact book

1045
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,780
I have I can then have end-to-end

1046
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,859
security

1047
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:38,400
if I'm going off to wignal or whatever

1048
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,680
and that is where the trans mapping

1049
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,940
takes place from atalissa to her public

1050
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,900
key I do not have end-to-end security

1051
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,520
and

1052
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,680
you know that's a place where you can

1053
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,099
have a rubber hose attack or a whatever

1054
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,020
and so that's one point the other point

1055
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,339
is that looking through all these

1056
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:01,020
presentations

1057
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,060
it appears that there is an assumption

1058
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,099
here that what you're going to build

1059
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,680
is a series of gateways because of

1060
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,300
course you've all got these large

1061
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,940
infrastructures and you think that the

1062
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,859
easiest way of going from where you are

1063
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:17,400
to where you want to be is going to gate

1064
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,560
each of the 10 messaging infrastructures

1065
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,900
to each other

1066
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,359
and we actually have a data point that

1067
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,000
tells us that's not stable because I

1068
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
remember the days when smt before SMTP

1069
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,380
dominated

1070
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,240
where I used to have to send my mail

1071
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,460
through different gateways

1072
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,260
and the reason we went from that model

1073
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,720
to us common protocol

1074
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,720
was it was just too much to maintain

1075
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,180
and so I I understand that we're going

1076
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,579
to go and Charter with the assumption

1077
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,260
that we're going to do a gateway

1078
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,319
but by the time we actually read out

1079
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,680
I assure you we will all be using a

1080
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,880
common protocol

1081
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,619
because that's going to be the easiest

1082
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:00,180
way

1083
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,339
okay so

1084
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:05,339
um before you before you sit down PHP

1085
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:07,260
the um

1086
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,880
the

1087
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,680
uh

1088
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,200
I take it that you are in full support

1089
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,780
of the end of end-to-end identity oh

1090
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,700
yeah being part of the of the problem

1091
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,380
statement from your from your comments

1092
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,960
and one thing that I didn't mention in

1093
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,140
that slide is that there is no

1094
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:25,800
um

1095
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,520
I've been careful when working on that

1096
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,119
part to try to make it clear that

1097
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,560
there are a lot of people who want to

1098
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,440
have sort of a hierarchical pki style

1099
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,700
uh

1100
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,220
way of doing that and we need to sort of

1101
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:44,099
leave the door open for things like like

1102
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:46,640
a you know just like a mesh

1103
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,880
a mesh based uh way of making these kind

1104
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,319
of assertions yeah one caveat there

1105
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:59,060
uh I want to have end-to-end public key

1106
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,900
when people use the term identity

1107
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,740
uh that's almost as bad as web 3 for me

1108
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,300
because

1109
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,099
you know it's one of those terms that

1110
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,859
when somebody uses it I have absolutely

1111
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:16,619
no idea what they mean by it

1112
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:19,440
and it tends to be a weasel word that

1113
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,200
allows us to do the shuffle from

1114
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,260
you know so I I I I I want to stick to

1115
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,599
my public keys because I know what that

1116
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,240
gives me in security World whereas if

1117
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,760
somebody says identity well now I've got

1118
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,220
a fluffy cloud and somebody can take

1119
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,339
away my strong public key based identity

1120
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:41,099
and stick you know

1121
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,040
a marshmallow in place and then I don't

1122
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,420
have end-to-end security I have

1123
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,099
end-to-end fluffy

1124
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:50,819
okay look forward to getting some

1125
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:53,060
yeah

1126
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,220
Jonathan all right uh Jonathan Rosenberg

1127
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,940
five nine so I I mostly wanted to offer

1128
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,800
clarifying response to some of the folks

1129
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,359
at the mic I think there's a little

1130
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,720
confusion on this uh perhaps uh the the

1131
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,280
charter the focus of this group I

1132
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,040
believe is not to build a whole Suite of

1133
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,660
things that someone could go Implement a

1134
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,099
new client and build a new service

1135
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,020
around and we're going to design

1136
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,540
the new protocol for how one would build

1137
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,200
a chat system from scratch

1138
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,060
um that's that that I mean maybe that's

1139
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,260
a side effect but that's not the

1140
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,119
objective the problem we're trying to

1141
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,380
solve is that there are existing

1142
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,599
messaging providers that already have

1143
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:32,040
servers that they have and they have

1144
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,960
clients that they have with billions of

1145
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,760
users billions of users and and we may

1146
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,140
be asking them to make changes by the

1147
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,220
way but we are starting with the

1148
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,800
assumption that that they exist and our

1149
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,480
goal is to interoperate and Federate

1150
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,640
them so fundamentally that is a server

1151
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,079
to server protocol

1152
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,940
with the big important exception that

1153
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,460
because of n10 encryption and end-to-end

1154
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,440
identity that comes along for the ride I

1155
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,819
think many most of us here working on

1156
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:55,920
stuff understand that Without End

1157
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,160
identity intent encryption is Fluffy uh

1158
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,440
so there will be consequentially pushing

1159
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,359
of see what I did there they'll be

1160
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,060
pushing of requirements uh into those

1161
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,680
systems for implementation of protocols

1162
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,380
like MLS and the associated internet but

1163
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,760
fundamentally we're building a server to

1164
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,740
server thing here and we're specifying

1165
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,900
those interfaces in this working group

1166
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,220
that's what I wanted to be clear we're

1167
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,660
doing so if things for example like

1168
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,220
Harold like let's worry about the scale

1169
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,319
of presence systems scale presence

1170
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,579
system is a big deal for the people who

1171
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:24,839
are implementing them

1172
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,640
we're not trying to build a specified

1173
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,260
protocol for them on how to build it

1174
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,660
they already have something we have to

1175
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,920
decide only whether or not we want

1176
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,359
presence messages to be exchanged

1177
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,760
between these providers and that's work

1178
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,140
I believe we'll do in the working group

1179
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,200
where we Define that minimal viable

1180
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,300
oh message format and whether there's a

1181
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,220
presence message or not so I think it's

1182
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,599
in that sense it's quite a simpler

1183
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,760
problem on the wire

1184
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,400
um see what I did there uh for uh you

1185
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,839
know getting these things implemented so

1186
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,760
that's that's my clarifying hopefully

1187
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,099
commentary

1188
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,480
thank you Colin

1189
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,640
I I just since there's been confusion I

1190
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,900
just wanted to clarify that my

1191
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,900
understanding uh of this with as phone

1192
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,339
numbers definitely in scope and the

1193
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,020
desirable user experiences if I had

1194
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,060
somebody else's phone number I'd have a

1195
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,400
chance of being able to connect and have

1196
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,660
communication with them if they wanted

1197
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,920
to

1198
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,900
um and the sort of requirements point of

1199
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,520
view that that was you know that that's

1200
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,660
what we were trying to get we weren't

1201
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,900
the the I thought we got way too deep in

1202
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,060
the weeds of possible implementations of

1203
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,760
ways that you could achieve that user

1204
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,500
experience about whether it required

1205
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,060
servers in the cloud or whether you had

1206
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,160
to know which service the person's on I

1207
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,599
mean a fundamental characteristics for

1208
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:38,460
me is I do not want to know which

1209
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,140
service I don't want to have to know

1210
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,940
what service somebody is on to be able

1211
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,440
to connect to them if all I know is

1212
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,000
their phone number I want to be able to

1213
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,020
connect to them so I want to make sure

1214
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,280
that from a requirements point of view

1215
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,380
we view that as one of the things we're

1216
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,099
trying to achieve

1217
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,619
we need to make sure we get clarity on

1218
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,040
this point

1219
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,720
I suggest we look at the we wait until

1220
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,760
we get to the Charter wording there yeah

1221
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,020
there's been a lot of discussion of this

1222
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,700
already

1223
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,380
um

1224
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,800
so um just one point that triggered me

1225
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,480
it was you had one slide where you

1226
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,740
mentioned you want to prevent

1227
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,119
impersonation

1228
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,599
and because of my Daily Business

1229
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:19,500
um

1230
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,619
uh

1231
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:24,900
I'm kind of more maybe like that that

1232
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,300
some something that's often overlooked

1233
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,640
with this aspect is that there are some

1234
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,099
use cases where impersonation is

1235
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:33,960
actually desirable for example the

1236
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,819
business use case where you have like an

1237
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:39,859
admin and you want to impart be like

1238
00:51:39,859 --> 00:51:42,720
impersonate a certain user

1239
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,460
um and I just wanted to raise awareness

1240
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,740
that there might be use cases out there

1241
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,240
where this is actually an important

1242
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,099
feature but as far as I understand

1243
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:53,220
usually that's more concerning long-term

1244
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,079
storage and not what you're talking

1245
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:56,339
about it just wants to double check

1246
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:59,099
basically yeah so

1247
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:00,599
um I wouldn't use the term impersonation

1248
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:02,940
for that I would use the term delegation

1249
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:08,000
oh yeah okay makes sense thanks

1250
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,260
Antoine

1251
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,020
hello

1252
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,579
uh I wanted to have a clarification on

1253
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:17,160
The View you have an interoperability is

1254
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,160
it do you mean that you want to specify

1255
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,339
a minimal list command denominator among

1256
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:25,079
the different systems that Implement

1257
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,079
instant messaging or do you want to

1258
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,740
provide a way for external systems that

1259
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,540
don't support a specific additional

1260
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,640
feature that you have on a given system

1261
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,359
so users from the outside world of your

1262
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:43,619
network can provide a way to

1263
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,619
an information that mimics this feature

1264
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,660
so the experience in your network is

1265
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,259
consistent

1266
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,700
I'm not sure I understood the your

1267
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,099
second option so

1268
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:58,920
um I'll I'll sort of give give an answer

1269
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,119
and then you can tell me whether that

1270
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:02,520
answers your question at

1271
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,200
I want to be able to send an instant

1272
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,359
message to people on multiple that

1273
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,559
currently are on multiple different

1274
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,960
services and I'd like them to be able to

1275
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,020
reply and be able to send me you know

1276
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,900
cat pictures and so on

1277
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,380
so for instance uh I will give a very

1278
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,380
stupid example from the beginning of the

1279
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,440
2000s if I want to whiz someone on

1280
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,780
something like messenger sorry you said

1281
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,300
you have an extent

1282
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,800
I didn't catch the word reach you said

1283
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,460
uh with the to have a way to shake the

1284
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,160
the window for instance a given feature

1285
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,119
do and it's not in the minimal

1286
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,220
interability message do you want to that

1287
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,700
your system uh provides an API so

1288
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,339
external user can mimic this feature or

1289
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:52,520
it's

1290
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,920
so the goal is we would Define we would

1291
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,280
have a discussion about requirements and

1292
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,099
so if you want to if if like having

1293
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:05,280
Rings or knocks or or window vibrations

1294
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,460
is a feature on some systems

1295
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,099
and that happens to not to not make the

1296
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:15,359
cut in terms of the common the common

1297
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,540
interoperable feature set that

1298
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,339
people who

1299
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:23,520
use whatever proprietary format they

1300
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,920
they currently use can still do that and

1301
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,839
if I'm in a group that doesn't do that I

1302
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,280
would not be able to do that but I would

1303
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,839
still be able to do all of the things

1304
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:32,819
that are in the common feature set okay

1305
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:37,079
that's personally my goal okay thank you

1306
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:40,160
okay thank you

1307
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,619
um you can now now you get to go yeah

1308
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:44,880
thanks Ron

1309
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,099
so we're gonna switch to the Charter

1310
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:49,640
discussion

1311
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,859
um

1312
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,640
so there was some discussion just now

1313
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,540
let me uh get the slides a bit there was

1314
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,819
some discussion about

1315
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:05,400
um whether particular requirements are

1316
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,599
present here

1317
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:10,200
think in terms of whether you want this

1318
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,119
group to decide requirements or you want

1319
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:14,339
it to be locked into the charter

1320
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:17,040
and that distinction for those of you

1321
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,800
who are not used to this process is do

1322
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,559
you want the entire ietf on board with

1323
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,079
this before we start or do you want this

1324
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,359
group deciding it the former is the

1325
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,660
chartering process the latter is this

1326
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,819
group coming to requirements

1327
00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:34,920
so make sure that the charter is clear

1328
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,660
enough for you that you think the

1329
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,579
requirements will be addressed by the

1330
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:41,520
group don't try and convince the ietf

1331
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,079
that they have to be on board with

1332
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,700
exactly what requirement you're talking

1333
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,780
about

1334
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,660
that of reasonable distinction

1335
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,880
all right let me uh

1336
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,619
we do have slides up yay

1337
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,599
Charter

1338
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:06,599
can you open it yeah let me

1339
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:09,119
well that's always

1340
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,339
let me get the charter up on my screen

1341
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,400
I guess I'm sharing a screen yeah

1342
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,960
yes yes yes

1343
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,640
so in the time it takes us to display

1344
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,040
the charter people can find it

1345
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,680
themselves and re-familiarize yourself

1346
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,780
or read it for the first time

1347
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,579
um it's linked from the slides and it's

1348
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:50,420
been on the mailing list

1349
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:54,720
it really says it's coming up here

1350
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,700
I think we should Charter the working

1351
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,339
group about the screen share being

1352
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:00,480
started

1353
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,079
um

1354
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,780
I think we would have the experts in the

1355
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,020
room from medecco to help us there we go

1356
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,420
okay

1357
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,980
give it a second to refresh

1358
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,180
damn Network people okay now you get

1359
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,579
two more minutes of awkward silence to

1360
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:22,079
read the charter

1361
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,220
I'm not going to read it

1362
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,700
gesundheit

1363
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,098
nice girl yeah

1364
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,220
how far do I want to scroll that's

1365
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:59,299
probably yeah that's probably good

1366
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,479
hi Ted can you scroll one more

1367
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,720
thanks

1368
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,540
eventually it'll upset so we have a

1369
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,180
couple of open PR's that hit on at least

1370
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,260
one of the topics we've already

1371
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,420
discussed so my inclination is to start

1372
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,940
with those if that's okay but if you

1373
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,280
have comments that you feel need to be

1374
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,559
addressed before we do that we can take

1375
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,980
them now

1376
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:40,920
he's thinking uh totally clarifying

1377
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,319
question uh how do you mean take the PRS

1378
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,240
do you want to discuss the PRS or just

1379
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,059
yeah okay so yeah what I want to talk

1380
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:50,280
about isn't in any of the PRS so if you

1381
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,079
want to do that I suggest you close the

1382
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,359
queue kick us all out and we start out

1383
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:56,220
again

1384
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,960
okay

1385
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,119
I'll just lock it

1386
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,380
although

1387
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:06,599
well that's not gonna work yeah okay

1388
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,780
um

1389
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,660
so I'm Rafael I'm like no okay my

1390
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,040
question was going to be about the PRS

1391
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,980
okay one sec why don't we go to the

1392
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,260
first one yeah

1393
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,440
okay

1394
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:24,180
um someone's still open

1395
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:28,279
yeah it was oh really

1396
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:34,380
okay so but this one is

1397
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,180
yeah I thought

1398
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,240
um

1399
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,980
oh I see okay no just start with the

1400
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,359
first one the first one is really easy

1401
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:45,020
okay

1402
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:51,720
oh it is called more closed yeah okay so

1403
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,500
um

1404
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,500
so this one related to the language

1405
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,599
um about how this working group will not

1406
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,579
be specifying new signaling protocols I

1407
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:02,460
think there was some confusion about uh

1408
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,040
that this term signaling protocols uh I

1409
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,020
think when the charter was written it

1410
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,240
was meant to imply

1411
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,339
um audio and video signaling

1412
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:14,579
specifically but it was not clear in in

1413
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:16,079
the context of the paragraph that that

1414
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,480
that was the limitation on it so I

1415
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,059
actually made an edit already to the

1416
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:23,880
Charter that that was just flashed up

1417
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,099
um such that this is now clear that it's

1418
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:30,299
only about audio and video signaling so

1419
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:32,339
if people still have concerns we should

1420
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:34,559
talk about it but I think this one has

1421
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,660
been addressed

1422
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,440
yes we got a thumbs up in the room

1423
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,299
anybody joining the queue

1424
01:00:42,299 --> 01:00:44,040
to talk about that

1425
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,119
good no okay so I think that one

1426
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:51,020
is taken care of

1427
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,640
so the next one is around Federation and

1428
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,160
message delivery text added by Raphael

1429
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,780
and there's been some

1430
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,099
um

1431
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:08,640
discussion of this one on the pr

1432
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,260
Raphael did you want to come talk about

1433
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,500
it

1434
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,420
um yeah it started from a discussion on

1435
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,500
the list and then there was some

1436
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,880
discussion on the pr and then on the

1437
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,000
list again so I think all the concerns

1438
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,740
have been addressed

1439
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,839
and what it looks like on that one

1440
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:27,180
but if there are any questions

1441
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,960
happy to answer

1442
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,859
so

1443
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:37,140
um does that include the new suggestion

1444
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,760
about the text that avoid centralized

1445
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,799
control over conversations

1446
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:43,619
I think that was cleared on list uh okay

1447
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:46,160
Matthew

1448
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:52,339
can you come to the mic sorry

1449
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,420
yep it's clear on the discussion on the

1450
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,200
list

1451
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,760
um but it should be back put that into

1452
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,660
the wording on the pr

1453
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:04,740
because the pr is currently saying oh

1454
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,140
was there a minute ago here we are the

1455
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,700
pr was saying that it specifically

1456
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,900
requires

1457
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,420
um ordering of handshake messages within

1458
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,460
groups you are explaining that can be

1459
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:17,700
done in a decentralized fashion or at

1460
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,319
least shared between the participants

1461
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,059
whereas that isn't clear here or at

1462
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:22,619
least it wasn't too yeah yeah I think

1463
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:23,880
there's some confusion around the

1464
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,319
terminology on that

1465
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:27,119
um so what I'm referencing is the

1466
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,460
architecture document and and that gives

1467
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,980
these two options and the pr is not

1468
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,180
specific about other one

1469
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,740
so okay I think the language in the pr

1470
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,799
is generic in that sense

1471
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,079
state your name yeah sorry Matthew

1472
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:46,799
Matthew Matrix

1473
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,119
Rowan uh so at the beginning of this

1474
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,299
discussion Pete said do you want the ITF

1475
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:55,980
to discuss this or do you want us to

1476
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,720
discuss this I think this is a clear

1477
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,760
case where

1478
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,220
the intention we've discussed in this

1479
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,260
room we've discussed among the like the

1480
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,599
main parties we agree

1481
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:08,819
um but adding more text this is going to

1482
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:10,920
be a red flag for the ITF it's going to

1483
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,960
cause confusion it I think that this

1484
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,720
will hold up triggering so I think the

1485
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,940
original wording that Raphael proposed

1486
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,819
is fine and then incorporates what we

1487
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:23,579
need uh I think as soon as we add avoid

1488
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:25,680
centralized control over then it's going

1489
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,000
to open up a whole can of worms we're

1490
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,500
going to have a discussion at the ITF

1491
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,599
instead I think we should have a

1492
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:31,740
discussion about

1493
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,079
you know what are the requirements

1494
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,319
in the in the working group once the

1495
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:40,079
working group is formed

1496
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,700
thanks Ron and we have Eric

1497
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:45,960
yeah I want to speak to that same point

1498
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,299
I agree with Rowan like this is this is

1499
01:03:48,299 --> 01:03:50,160
quite classic over specification in the

1500
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,000
charter

1501
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,280
um and we should like the Rafael's text

1502
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,319
looks like reasonable to me um I made

1503
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:56,579
words with the disappoint later but like

1504
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:57,780
the German looks fine

1505
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,040
um but I think that like writing this

1506
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,240
text here is going to like cause all

1507
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,980
kinds of problems and I don't even know

1508
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,119
what it means so like let's just start

1509
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,760
there um so uh it's like yeah I think we

1510
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,660
shot it are you okay with that

1511
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:14,480
Matthew are you in the queue yeah sorry

1512
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,280
um if I can insert myself do I have to

1513
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,380
press a button no

1514
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,119
um but say your name again so that

1515
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:25,500
everybody knows you're talking sure

1516
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,839
Matthew Hopson for Matrix

1517
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:30,299
um I guess my uh I may be missing some

1518
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:32,339
of the Politics as to why it would

1519
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:35,280
become an ITF level concern

1520
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,799
um if we

1521
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:41,640
uh if we discussed um the idea that the

1522
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:45,000
ordering needs to or does not have to be

1523
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,280
done in a centralized fashion because at

1524
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,960
the moment it really seems to imply here

1525
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,780
that it has to be centralized

1526
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,059
where

1527
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:56,280
by talking about ordering of handshake

1528
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,140
messages within groups

1529
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,299
actually centralized

1530
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:03,059
okay so the implication is that as long

1531
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:04,799
as there is some kind of ordering that

1532
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,299
could be done by a vaxxa clock or it

1533
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:07,920
could be done in the centralized

1534
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,140
if everyone is happy that's why everyone

1535
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,940
employs centralization then I'm happy

1536
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,980
yeah I I don't think this applies

1537
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,480
Central position if you think that if

1538
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,920
you have texts that would like my

1539
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,559
problem is that is the is the is I mean

1540
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:21,180
I I generally agree with this like I

1541
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,579
think the intent of this is but um but I

1542
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:24,660
don't know but I don't know quite what

1543
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,040
it actually means and so I think if you

1544
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,599
want to just avoid if you have

1545
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:28,740
suggestions that make this not

1546
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,240
prescribing centralized did you make

1547
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,319
those suggestions but I think trying to

1548
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:32,700
prescribe non-centralized is the problem

1549
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,339
here okay yeah totally agree

1550
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:37,500
okay so you're fine with Raphael's

1551
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:42,059
original suggestion okay great thanks

1552
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:45,260
and then we have one more

1553
01:05:54,299 --> 01:05:56,339
do we have an actual yeah can you look

1554
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:59,760
at the um can you look at the the diff

1555
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,760
yeah

1556
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,920
there we go

1557
01:06:10,859 --> 01:06:13,140
so this is the topic that we were just

1558
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:14,460
discussing earlier with the introduction

1559
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,280
problem

1560
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:22,799
and the current suggestion here is

1561
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:26,400
to add text which indicates that the

1562
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,619
working group May investigate and

1563
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,660
develop a protocol to discover the

1564
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,700
target user's preferred application so

1565
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,720
it's not uh it's not decided that that

1566
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,400
is definitely going to happen but it's

1567
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,740
offered as an option

1568
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,578
10.

1569
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:47,460
uh totally optimism Enthusiast

1570
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,039
um so I I really appreciate the optimism

1571
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,900
uh by which the proponents are brought

1572
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,460
forward uh the work in general

1573
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:55,260
especially given our past history here

1574
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,660
that that's really cool and important

1575
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,339
um but I think the introduction problem

1576
01:06:59,339 --> 01:07:02,520
text as it stands now and even with the

1577
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,400
just disappeared PR yeah

1578
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,500
um

1579
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,299
sorry Pete I was really going to refer

1580
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:13,079
to that so uh even without it the way

1581
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:15,240
it's currently written uh needs a

1582
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,920
complete rewrite not a small change

1583
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,839
because the way it's currently written

1584
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:20,400
it's a completely separable problem

1585
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,740
right you could you could gen up a

1586
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:25,500
working group that had as its goal

1587
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,720
solving the introduction problem across

1588
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:32,460
these services without a goal of uh

1589
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:35,579
creating interoperability among them

1590
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:37,140
um and I think that's not what you

1591
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,819
actually want I think what you're trying

1592
01:07:38,819 --> 01:07:42,539
to say is for the systems which have

1593
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:45,119
signed up to interoperate by

1594
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,640
implementing whatever Mimi comes up with

1595
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:51,240
we will have a mechanism to allow

1596
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,819
introduction to occur and the way it's

1597
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:57,839
written now sounds a lot broader than I

1598
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,039
think

1599
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,079
um the minimal viable product would be

1600
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:03,839
here so I suggest that this text

1601
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,599
actually get hacked a good bit more than

1602
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:10,440
the pr that's in there now to say

1603
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,619
Mimi will consider developing a protocol

1604
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:15,080
to allow

1605
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:19,080
conformant services to provide a

1606
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,698
mechanism

1607
01:08:20,698 --> 01:08:23,580
to introduce

1608
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:27,719
their subscribers across other

1609
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:31,439
conformant services so I think that what

1610
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,600
we're trying to do here is actually much

1611
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,479
less ocean boiling than this sounds like

1612
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,640
and I think for a charter to get through

1613
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,198
the rest of the process we have to make

1614
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:42,839
it clear that we're only boiling the

1615
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:44,460
parts of the ocean that have

1616
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,219
deliberately dug the canals we specify

1617
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:51,479
so Rowan it may be about to answer the

1618
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:55,040
question I'm going to ask here but

1619
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,279
introduction and Discovery seem like

1620
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,120
very different kinds of things

1621
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,080
are are do you see them Ted as

1622
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:11,160
it intertwined connected the same or are

1623
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,620
they two very different things

1624
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,359
can I say that that's a problem for the

1625
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,339
working group

1626
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:19,738
because I'd like to say that if you

1627
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,080
don't mind

1628
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,359
how Okay Rowan how about you go take a

1629
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:27,120
shot Ted how would you feel about the

1630
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,738
working group May investigate and

1631
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:32,279
develop a protocol for use with Mimi to

1632
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:33,839
discover the target users preferred

1633
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,460
applications in which that Target should

1634
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,979
be reached

1635
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:42,060
so I I think for use with Mimi is less

1636
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,799
restrictive than what I proposed and I

1637
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:45,479
would preserve something even more

1638
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:47,279
restrictive than that but if the working

1639
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,799
group wants if the if the charter

1640
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:52,198
discussion leads to your text I will not

1641
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:53,819
fall upon a sword

1642
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:57,840
okay because uh again don't leave come

1643
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,040
back

1644
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,260
finish finish your thought

1645
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,120
s

1646
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,540
I was just going to say that the if we

1647
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:10,140
add those four words or whatever

1648
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,780
um then that becomes a requirements

1649
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,179
question for the working group where I

1650
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:17,460
would certainly support you in saying no

1651
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,540
we're not going to use this protocol

1652
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,460
generically

1653
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,920
I'm sorry I just missed the last three

1654
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,020
words of your utterance if you wouldn't

1655
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,540
mind saying them again uh

1656
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,760
it becomes a requirements question that

1657
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,159
I you know where I for one would help

1658
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,380
you in the working group

1659
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,480
say no we don't it's not a requirement

1660
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,580
to make this work outside of Mimi

1661
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,940
uh I okay I I think we're we're close to

1662
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,440
convergence there which is good news

1663
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:50,760
wait don't leave because sorry

1664
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,520
people stand around at microphones

1665
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,100
sorry Ted I thought you were also you

1666
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,560
were because what Rowan just spoke about

1667
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,900
is more to this additional sentence that

1668
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,060
he was adding but I thought you were

1669
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,920
um you were concerned about this the

1670
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,900
prior sentence as well where we say

1671
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,280
we're going to specify a solution to the

1672
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,260
introduction problem that needs to be

1673
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:13,560
narrowed according to you correct yes

1674
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,719
and I think that he was saying that the

1675
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:16,920
narrowing would occur in the working

1676
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,179
group

1677
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:20,040
um by the discussion of ensuring that

1678
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,900
the requirements were focused only on

1679
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:25,219
Mimi compliant services

1680
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,980
okay yeah okay then uh I think I have an

1681
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,560
action item to uh raise an issue and a

1682
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,580
propose a PR yes um but I I hope that

1683
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,800
the general question of how we ensure

1684
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,840
that this does not become the ocean

1685
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,640
boiling question of solving the

1686
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,140
introduction problem for people who

1687
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:46,020
haven't signed up for Mimi is leaves the

1688
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,820
charter one way or the other whether you

1689
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,800
take my PR or somebody else

1690
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,920
got it thank you Eric

1691
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,659
so I don't want to worry too much of

1692
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:56,040
Charter checks at this exact moment and

1693
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,780
try to scope out the problem space is

1694
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,640
that for a second as Pete says it seems

1695
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,560
to me there are two problems one problem

1696
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,719
is give an identifier and the service it

1697
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:04,679
is on

1698
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:07,679
arranging to connect a to B

1699
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,540
um and we can go in induction if we want

1700
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,219
we can call it you know introduction if

1701
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:13,140
we want I don't care and then separately

1702
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,580
as Pete says there's a discovery problem

1703
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,739
which is give it an identifier that is

1704
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:18,600
not qualified by service determining

1705
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,719
which Services it might or not be on and

1706
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:23,760
um I believe there's consensus that the

1707
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,080
first problem needs to be solved or the

1708
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,760
whole thing falls apart and I believe

1709
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,199
that there is the center or the second

1710
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:29,760
problem needs to be solved

1711
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,199
um so I see Jonathan nodding so I think

1712
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,820
I've accurately characterized this

1713
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:33,540
um

1714
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:34,860
um I personally would like to solve the

1715
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,600
second problem but I can live with text

1716
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,179
which makes that odd working position

1717
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:41,580
um so um so if I guess what I would say

1718
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:43,920
is without looking like in pertaining

1719
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,300
this priority not exist

1720
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,159
if people do people agree with that

1721
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:48,420
framing because if they agree with that

1722
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:49,620
framing I think we can extract text to

1723
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:52,159
all make that happen

1724
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,040
Colin College uh so so I I think Ecker

1725
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,540
as usual's got exactly the right Framing

1726
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,760
and I want to focus just in on the

1727
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,340
Discovery part which is I want to make

1728
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,560
sure that it is an option for the

1729
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,360
working group to decide if they can

1730
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,040
solve that or not they may find it's an

1731
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,840
impossible Problem Solver they may they

1732
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,400
may solve it

1733
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,679
um but I do not want to continue to

1734
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:18,420
insert these words in there that it's a

1735
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,400
new protocol that we'd have to do to do

1736
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,719
this because I think the best Solutions

1737
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:24,360
don't involve a protocol at all

1738
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,179
um and so I I would rather not keep

1739
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:29,520
embedding Rowan's solution into the

1740
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,020
charter text on this right so because

1741
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,540
I'm not I don't like that

1742
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,640
sorry

1743
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,440
I just want to discuss the problem to be

1744
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,600
solved I don't want to it does not need

1745
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,179
any discussion of How It's solved right

1746
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:46,679
I see okay thanks Phil so a general

1747
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:49,920
question a point throughout the chart uh

1748
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,380
at some points the term identity is used

1749
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:55,560
and the other other points we have user

1750
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,760
identifier

1751
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,520
they both appear to be meaning the same

1752
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,699
thing I'd like to propose that we use

1753
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:04,440
user identifier

1754
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,520
throughout and Nick's identity which is

1755
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,460
uh you're looking in in the terms that

1756
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:14,340
it is being used it is certainly being

1757
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,880
used to me as a user identifier

1758
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,800
and you know my Twitter handle is not my

1759
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,159
identity

1760
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,699
yeah yeah it was you've got a good one

1761
01:14:25,699 --> 01:14:28,380
uh nor is my public key their

1762
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,040
identifiers uh the other thing is if

1763
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,920
take I was going to wait a bit uh

1764
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,840
if you look at the bits that we uh say

1765
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,020
are out of scope the last one the Oracle

1766
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,659
to do the user lookup

1767
01:14:42,659 --> 01:14:45,840
that appears that statement appears to

1768
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,699
be saying we're not going to be doing

1769
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:51,420
what we're talking about doing here

1770
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,780
if you you know this is well

1771
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,300
so it's quite possible that in well

1772
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,460
obviously this is just suggested as an

1773
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,080
edit to the Charter and the previous

1774
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,780
version did not contain this and

1775
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:05,520
therefore it is ruled out of scope in

1776
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,860
the base text yeah so I you know I I

1777
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,960
would like to just remove that Oracle

1778
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,219
line talking about the Oracle because

1779
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:13,080
you know that is something that you're

1780
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,620
gonna need

1781
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,020
but so on the identity Point

1782
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,179
um I think people should should respond

1783
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:23,699
because my understanding was that

1784
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:24,960
actually we do mean two different things

1785
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,060
when we say identifier and identity and

1786
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,460
the identity is the cryptographic

1787
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:32,340
identity and the identifier is

1788
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,679
is you know whatever we're using on a

1789
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:36,840
particular service so if people have

1790
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,520
opinions about that please respond

1791
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,480
Matthew

1792
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,159
um on the pr list

1793
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:45,659
um I think you're missing one there's

1794
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:48,120
number seven which I submitted earlier

1795
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,800
um based on the earlier question if you

1796
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,400
can refresh

1797
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,320
I will refresh

1798
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,360
and this GitHub is having some kind of

1799
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,360
consistency meltdown

1800
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,640
which is a trivial one just suggesting

1801
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,280
that we explicitly put that data method

1802
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,920
of data permissions and Skype yeah that

1803
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,860
one the 22 minutes ago which one

1804
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,380
number

1805
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,739
oh well it was opened during the yeah

1806
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:18,960
okay all right

1807
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,300
um but can we can we finish I would like

1808
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,580
to finish on number

1809
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,260
four

1810
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,480
so

1811
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,219
are we finished on number four does

1812
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:30,659
anyone have anything else to say on

1813
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:33,120
number four are you in the queue

1814
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,360
yes you are in the Q next I am but I was

1815
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,560
doing this intentionally trying to beat

1816
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,480
the end of the number four discussion it

1817
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,580
is kind of a broader point about this

1818
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:44,820
passage but not about the specific PR so

1819
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:46,739
I mean when I read this I still think

1820
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:49,199
there's a bit of tension in the way the

1821
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:50,520
charter is structured which I'm sure

1822
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,260
we'll resolve this is I think this is a

1823
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,820
simple one between that that last

1824
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,800
sentence that Express user preferences

1825
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,140
about discoverability and reachability

1826
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,800
must be respected insofar as I suspect a

1827
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,980
lot of messaging systems have properties

1828
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:06,659
that preclude in certain cases

1829
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:08,520
discoverability and reachability as a

1830
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,620
feature that we're not expressly

1831
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:13,199
preferences of the user but are part of

1832
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,820
the reason why the users use the surface

1833
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,900
so in other words this is this is I'm

1834
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,760
talking entirely about you know social

1835
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,060
media style messaging systems where you

1836
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,679
curate very carefully the set of people

1837
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:26,699
that you're supposed to be in contact

1838
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:29,760
with this interacts a lot with both the

1839
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,380
introduction problem and with the

1840
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,320
question of um the degree to which like

1841
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,600
spam mitigation is actually in scope of

1842
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,120
this or not so I guess my the only

1843
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,260
question I had about this and I wanted

1844
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,120
to do this because we have this BR open

1845
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,980
does it have to be Express user

1846
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:46,500
preferences or is it properties of the

1847
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,800
systems

1848
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:54,659
the the text says to paraphrase any

1849
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:57,960
preference that is expressed must be

1850
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,420
respected now I read Express user

1851
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,159
preferences to mean I had to say

1852
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,600
intentionally I don't want to be

1853
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,580
discovered and we have to respect that

1854
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,380
and of course we should respect that but

1855
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:09,719
I I guess I am hypothesizing there are

1856
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:10,980
actually a lot of properties of common

1857
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,900
systems that have an introduction

1858
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,600
problem that users don't have to press a

1859
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,340
button to say that but the reason why

1860
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,659
they're on the service is because it has

1861
01:18:18,659 --> 01:18:21,120
that property so it's not like I

1862
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,860
expressed it it's not an Express user

1863
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,480
preference it is an innate preference

1864
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:28,260
but I guess what I'm saying is the the

1865
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:31,500
sentence that's in the charter here is

1866
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,719
the inverse of that it's saying if the

1867
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:35,880
user does express it that must be

1868
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,699
respected it for anything that's not

1869
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:41,460
expressed it doesn't say anything later

1870
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,380
the charter says like everything that's

1871
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,179
concerned with Spam and abuse we're

1872
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,040
kicking down the can we may do it but a

1873
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,540
lot of it is out of scope it's metadata

1874
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,820
analysis now in fact think the main way

1875
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:53,640
those systems mitigate spam is through

1876
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,840
things users don't express his

1877
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,640
preferences so that's why I was asking

1878
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,860
if that we could maybe tweak that but

1879
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,840
this I don't want to take the entire

1880
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,880
working group's time on this if this is

1881
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,219
a complicated one no I I think this is a

1882
01:19:05,219 --> 01:19:06,239
good point

1883
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,040
we have to figure out how to capture

1884
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:08,880
that

1885
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,739
um because I don't think it's sort of

1886
01:19:10,739 --> 01:19:12,300
like it's both expressed and implied

1887
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:15,719
yeah uh but that's not a great anyway I

1888
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:16,620
just wanted to stick this in because

1889
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,480
this was up and I I know we've got other

1890
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,780
things to discuss but okay okay

1891
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,719
Express and implied sounds great to me

1892
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,780
Alyssa okay maybe we can try that okay

1893
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:30,480
thank you okay

1894
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,080
Peter

1895
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,199
uh hi Peter Castleman

1896
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:43,140
um on the identity uh point I think

1897
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,640
there's a difference between an

1898
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,440
identifier of an individual in the

1899
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,140
system some kind of handle a number but

1900
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,000
there's also other identity attributes

1901
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,380
that we're gonna have to deal with

1902
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:54,840
things like display names or display

1903
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,120
names organizations

1904
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,460
um there's other aspects of identity

1905
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,860
that we will want to convey so I think

1906
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:03,600
it's it's useful to maybe distinguish

1907
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,219
but I don't think you can sort of copy

1908
01:20:05,219 --> 01:20:07,380
and replace or just just talk about the

1909
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:09,840
identifier uh there's gonna be other

1910
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,780
identity considerations as well

1911
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:16,199
thank you Rowan

1912
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:18,360
um I was just going to say

1913
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,140
um I think we have some specific texts

1914
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:24,780
that it seems like people are are happy

1915
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,460
with and different for different

1916
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,860
problems with this PR which I'm happy to

1917
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,500
to write and I would have already

1918
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,679
uploaded to GitHub uh as a change to

1919
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:37,380
this PR but I can't get to GitHub right

1920
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,500
now

1921
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,900
okay well Ted also has an action to work

1922
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,280
on this so

1923
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,060
um

1924
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,980
so as it happens I can't get to GitHub

1925
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,900
and I just filed peer number 10 which I

1926
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,340
think tries to enact what I mentioned

1927
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:52,440
earlier and I hope people will be happy

1928
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,880
with I'm not suggesting necessarily

1929
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,500
people accept that now but you take a

1930
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,060
look

1931
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:01,699
it also has an implied to the separate

1932
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,120
thank you

1933
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,560
so I just have a bit of a clarifying

1934
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,540
question here so

1935
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,100
I'm kind of following and getting up to

1936
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,440
speed there was a question from Eric to

1937
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,800
say is Discovery in or out

1938
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,600
and I'm listening to the discussion

1939
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,260
about identifiers and identity

1940
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,880
and I kind of think they're the same

1941
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:28,500
question if we say identity is me but I

1942
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,140
have identifiers in different systems

1943
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:33,540
does that open the question of how does

1944
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:36,420
Eric speak to me and discover which

1945
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:39,300
identifier to use which will get to me

1946
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,880
out of the many identifiers I have that

1947
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,120
identify my identity too many idents in

1948
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,920
that sentence I apologize

1949
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,560
and should it therefore be pushed out of

1950
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,140
scope of discoveries out of scope or

1951
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,120
absolutely addressed within the charter

1952
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,480
if we are doing discovery

1953
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,678
that's my open question

1954
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,739
so there's obvious dependencies

1955
01:22:03,739 --> 01:22:07,199
depending on like which cell in The

1956
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,420
Matrix we end up in here

1957
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:12,000
um so the charter needs to ultimately be

1958
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,940
internally consistent that's for sure

1959
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:18,020
um if that's kind of your point

1960
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:23,460
I I think the the answer to what's in

1961
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:26,940
the charter is it should what I'm

1962
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,699
hearing is it should allow this group to

1963
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:31,980
take on the discoverability question but

1964
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,900
not require it

1965
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,060
the that the group will decide once up

1966
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,100
and running whether they're taking on

1967
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,500
discoverability and examine that problem

1968
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,140
see if they can address it

1969
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:46,140
David

1970
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,100
come on

1971
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,300
hello I'm David

1972
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:57,380
um I had a quick thing on the

1973
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:00,179
deferring and this might not be the

1974
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:02,820
correct time for it this and if it's not

1975
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,140
the correct time for it please tell me

1976
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,960
but deferring the whole spam and abuse

1977
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,600
problem till later yeah why don't we why

1978
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,560
don't we

1979
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,199
just try to close up on Discovery versus

1980
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,239
introduction and then come to it I'm

1981
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:18,179
sure people want to talk about that

1982
01:23:18,179 --> 01:23:19,500
so

1983
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,060
are others in the queue to continue

1984
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,640
discussing Discovery and introduction

1985
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,159
yes you are Eric you're next I I think

1986
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,140
just briefly

1987
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,480
um the am but we're gonna we will in

1988
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,560
fact need to like clarify because

1989
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,540
internology is great about like King

1990
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:35,520
material versus versus

1991
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,560
um versus like names

1992
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,360
um versus like real names um Jonathan

1993
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,739
rosenberg's draft was a quite a nice job

1994
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:42,780
actually of trying to technical taxonomy

1995
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:44,580
of the various things so I think like

1996
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:45,780
that's something we can do offline we

1997
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:46,980
can make a pass through and like use

1998
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,300
either terminology from there somewhere

1999
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,800
else that tries to try to cut those

2000
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,060
apart right and I certainly agree with

2001
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,580
php's point but like the public keys and

2002
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,380
and and names identifiers are all

2003
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:56,280
different things but I think I think

2004
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,179
that's something we can actually do

2005
01:23:57,179 --> 01:23:58,440
offline because I don't there's actually

2006
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,760
disagreement about it I think it's like

2007
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,540
the writing needs some

2008
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,219
thanks

2009
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:08,219
felt this might be a point where looking

2010
01:24:08,219 --> 01:24:10,140
back to the EU thing might actually help

2011
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:10,920
us

2012
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,179
in that

2013
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:15,420
what is the EU asking us to do

2014
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:18,780
they're not asking us to provide a

2015
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,760
mechanism that allows me to sit at my

2016
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:24,060
keyboard and find Pete Resnick

2017
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,940
what they're asking us to do is to have

2018
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:30,120
a mechanism that if I'm already in

2019
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:31,980
contact with Pete

2020
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,380
they want me to have a mechanism that

2021
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:36,540
allows Pete to send an identifier to me

2022
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:40,739
that I can input into a chat client that

2023
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:43,739
allows me to talk to Pete even though

2024
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:46,140
we're using different service providers

2025
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:50,040
now that is a discovery problem but it

2026
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,260
is a much more narrowly constrained

2027
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:54,840
Discovery problem than the broad one

2028
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,540
that we've been expanding it out to

2029
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:00,840
and in ITF terms that is something that

2030
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:04,620
for me comes back to Uris because the

2031
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:07,620
whole idea of Uris is a uniform

2032
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:09,719
identifier space that you can map any

2033
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:12,239
form of identifier onto so you can cut

2034
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,760
and paste them between people

2035
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,699
so that's the sort of thing that I would

2036
01:25:17,699 --> 01:25:20,100
suggest we we look at

2037
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,719
so

2038
01:25:21,719 --> 01:25:24,199
I would say that

2039
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:27,420
because half of that sounded like a

2040
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,980
requirements discussion and half of it

2041
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,440
sounded like a potential Charter item

2042
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,860
discussion and I I guess I'd ask you to

2043
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:38,820
hammer out or or bang on the uh Charter

2044
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,520
text to see if it would allow for the

2045
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,040
group to come to that conclusion does

2046
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,560
that make sense yeah okay okay yeah I I

2047
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,940
I I thought that you're going to come

2048
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:49,020
back and say well I don't want to talk

2049
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:50,280
to you no

2050
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,900
yeah

2051
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,239
would have been a good answer

2052
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,699
Mallory Mallory noodles Center for

2053
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:58,440
democracy and Technology might comment

2054
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,900
is similar to php's in that this is not

2055
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:04,739
the interoperable identity buff this is

2056
01:26:04,739 --> 01:26:06,239
um should really really narrowly be

2057
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:09,000
scoped both Charter and requirements to

2058
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,260
make sure that identity is in service of

2059
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,540
the messaging and now I understand

2060
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,460
because I was a real proponent of

2061
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:21,239
keeping discoverability in this

2062
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:22,980
um on the list previously and now I

2063
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,540
understand why people didn't want it

2064
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:26,699
because I think it gets us to this point

2065
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:29,880
where we are building

2066
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,560
um interoperability or interoperable

2067
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,900
identity which would be a total disaster

2068
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,060
and I don't think we want that so

2069
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,340
um if there's a way we can both in the

2070
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:40,500
charter and requirements every time

2071
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,980
Identity or identifiers are mentioned

2072
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:47,040
making sure that it's within the service

2073
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:51,260
of the messaging piece

2074
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:54,840
sounds good I'm gonna close the queue

2075
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,840
for this topic in a minute so if you

2076
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,400
have anything else to say on this topic

2077
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,860
please join the queue

2078
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,659
Matthew

2079
01:27:03,659 --> 01:27:05,400
um I just want to go back to the

2080
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,900
metadata residency thing on pr7 if just

2081
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:11,520
to make sure it doesn't get dropped off

2082
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,679
the charts or at least

2083
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:15,719
give us a few minutes for people to say

2084
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:17,460
whether it's the appropriate thing to

2085
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:18,600
add in

2086
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,060
yes we will come we will come okay yeah

2087
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:22,860
yeah sorry we're just like trying to

2088
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:26,360
close off this one yeah

2089
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:28,679
Carol

2090
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:32,040
had a lot of strum just to the words

2091
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,100
application and service are used in this

2092
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,360
Charter

2093
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,280
in a way that

2094
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,040
sometimes seems to make them mean the

2095
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,020
same thing and sometimes make them seem

2096
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,320
different both terms are undefined

2097
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,960
I think we should use only one term for

2098
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,639
one thing and

2099
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:53,639
Define them carefully

2100
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:56,520
probably since this seems to be focusing

2101
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,400
on a gatewaying problem

2102
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:02,719
we should use service throughout

2103
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,620
thanks good good point

2104
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:10,880
Rowan are you in the queue still

2105
01:28:11,179 --> 01:28:13,139
Rowan

2106
01:28:13,139 --> 01:28:14,940
did you like are you in the queue are

2107
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:17,460
you done uh I just wanted to say

2108
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:20,040
regarding the

2109
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,960
um PR number 10

2110
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,420
I am very happy with this text and I

2111
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:26,520
want happy to happily if people are

2112
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,199
happy with this I'm happy to remove PR

2113
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:31,320
number four and close up

2114
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,480
do we want to take a hum or something on

2115
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,040
this or

2116
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,460
so I think Ted was

2117
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:41,280
had uh maybe needs to look at it based

2118
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,199
on his earlier comment

2119
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,000
um unless you've done that already and

2120
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,520
you feel comfortable but

2121
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,280
yeah

2122
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:53,159
uh I don't think we do it I put in a PR

2123
01:28:53,159 --> 01:28:55,560
uh that claimed it didn't have a merge

2124
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,360
conflict oh maybe it's because I didn't

2125
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,820
face on yours yeah okay so we need to

2126
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:01,440
rebase but I think that they're uh

2127
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,620
there's there there shouldn't be a major

2128
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:07,620
problem in resolving that

2129
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:10,199
conceptually fine so there there may be

2130
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:12,360
a rebase problem there but as I was

2131
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,679
doing it while trying to listen to the

2132
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,540
conversation and yeah yeah it's a little

2133
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,340
hard to multitask so I think I think

2134
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,440
we're in a good place with with this uh

2135
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,540
item we can kind of resolve the final

2136
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:24,000
differences uh immediately after the

2137
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,320
buff and

2138
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,360
um take it that way I don't think we

2139
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,199
need to

2140
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:30,000
decide on specific words at the moment

2141
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,440
give people a little time to look at the

2142
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,800
PRS so I'm going to unlock the queue and

2143
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,320
I think we should come to PR number

2144
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:38,280
seven

2145
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,800
here and then we'll come back around to

2146
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,239
spam and anything else people want to

2147
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,419
talk about

2148
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,159
we can remove him

2149
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:54,060
there we go yeah let's show you the C7

2150
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,100
there's seven

2151
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,179
well

2152
01:29:57,179 --> 01:29:59,280
as soon as the screen refreshes so I I

2153
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,480
commented this I think this is over

2154
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,820
specification in the charter

2155
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,560
like I understand the motivation but

2156
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,940
like

2157
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,920
this is like

2158
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,360
this this is like one in many

2159
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,159
requirements so I might think what might

2160
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:12,540
be desirable

2161
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,100
um but it's not like actually that core

2162
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,600
to what's actually happening here and I

2163
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,600
think that it should not be the Turner

2164
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,880
I mean like if we're gonna like add

2165
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,199
every property that like would be good

2166
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:23,340
to the Charter we're gonna be here for

2167
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,580
everyone

2168
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,600
Raphael

2169
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,620
um yeah I think I agree with that in the

2170
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:32,760
sense that metadata has not been

2171
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,500
introduced as a term so far and this is

2172
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,940
oddly specific

2173
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:39,840
uh while also introducing uh metadata so

2174
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,060
yeah I agree with like I said

2175
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,400
if you want to talk about metadata we

2176
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,659
would have to do something more

2177
01:30:45,659 --> 01:30:47,159
comprehensive

2178
01:30:47,159 --> 01:30:49,980
but there is no PR for that

2179
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:53,580
Jonathan Jonathan Rosenberg I think the

2180
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,920
express and implied preferences language

2181
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,900
that we already have in the charter

2182
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,300
gives the working group the room to sort

2183
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,159
out the details on these things and is

2184
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,560
sufficient so I agree I I don't think

2185
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,900
this is needed in the charter I think

2186
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,460
it's a fabulous discussion for the

2187
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,940
working group

2188
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,420
anyone else wanna

2189
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:18,560
Express an opinion

2190
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:20,699
okay

2191
01:31:20,699 --> 01:31:25,860
okay so it sounds like if we add implied

2192
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:27,600
people are comfortable oh we have

2193
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,020
Brendan

2194
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,839
okay

2195
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:37,860
uh Brendan Warren I think that the data

2196
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:39,480
residency is an incredibly important

2197
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,880
problem and the metadata residency I'd

2198
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,900
prefer to have it in there

2199
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,559
okay Mallory

2200
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,840
Mallory noodle CDT

2201
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,000
um I wanted to put on Mike something

2202
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,679
that Nick Doty said in the chat which is

2203
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,620
really smart to just remove

2204
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:01,560
the word express and just say user

2205
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,840
preferences rather than adding implied

2206
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,320
but this is not exactly about this I

2207
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,880
tend to agree with others that we don't

2208
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,860
need to introduce the metadata if it's

2209
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:12,239
not mentioned anywhere else in the

2210
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:15,239
charter but because Ecker and others

2211
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:16,920
brought up just that word again I wanted

2212
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,199
to offer that alternative

2213
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,440
so can I can you stay for a minute

2214
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,280
um

2215
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,059
so

2216
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:28,860
you don't think that user preferences

2217
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:32,900
implies uh expression

2218
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,159
um no actually I think that user

2219
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:38,460
preferences so so if we so back to the

2220
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,780
conversation before I didn't come on

2221
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:42,179
Mike then because I felt others were

2222
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:44,400
um handling rather well but my reaction

2223
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:47,699
to it was you actually

2224
01:32:47,699 --> 01:32:50,400
um need to ask

2225
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,400
now so that the implied piece I think

2226
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,040
means that we're not okay with it being

2227
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,460
implied anymore we actually do need to

2228
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:02,820
um confront and make visible these

2229
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:05,520
implied preferences somehow now

2230
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,040
and so what are the what are the implied

2231
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,780
what are user preferences that are now

2232
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:14,300
implied that must be expressed and shift

2233
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:17,639
this so that interoperability works and

2234
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:21,000
user I don't think it's okay to work

2235
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,980
based on implied user preferences

2236
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,179
because

2237
01:33:24,179 --> 01:33:25,440
um we don't know what they are and

2238
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,880
there's no way for users to feed back

2239
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,380
then so that's a problem that has to be

2240
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:30,900
solved in the context of this working

2241
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,100
group it doesn't have to be in the

2242
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:34,980
charter so if you remove Express you

2243
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:36,540
just talk about user preferences it's

2244
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,340
something we have to address in the

2245
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:40,679
working group we can figure out how to

2246
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:42,480
make implied user preferences more

2247
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,400
expressed user preferences and then deal

2248
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,960
with

2249
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,060
the express user preferences and

2250
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:51,860
respecting those if that makes sense

2251
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,340
Victoria

2252
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,900
yeah getting back to the data residency

2253
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:00,540
working I think that maybe data

2254
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:02,639
metallurgism is a bit too specific but

2255
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,260
I've been in favor of keeping a

2256
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:05,820
reference to something a little more

2257
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,440
generic like data processing meaning

2258
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,320
that when you introduce the the join the

2259
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,560
Federation then you you I mean you must

2260
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,940
keep the principle that it's the user

2261
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:16,679
that decides where the data can or

2262
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:19,080
cannot go which is the basic principle

2263
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,480
of the European privacy laws anyway so

2264
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,100
the point is that that there should be a

2265
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,780
way for user to say I want my data to go

2266
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:27,000
there or not to really go there or just

2267
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,100
all throughout them

2268
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,420
thank you

2269
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:32,340
John

2270
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,080
yeah I think we might need to take this

2271
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,639
user preferences thing to the list

2272
01:34:35,639 --> 01:34:38,040
because I think this is a lot thornier

2273
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:40,679
because again I I think especially

2274
01:34:40,679 --> 01:34:42,239
because this is a paragraph about the

2275
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:44,040
introduction problem

2276
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,800
the introduction problem you know it has

2277
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,900
been conditioned for us all by the way

2278
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:51,540
that social media networks operate and

2279
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:52,980
the way that people curate lists of

2280
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:54,300
friends and things that are similar to

2281
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:56,460
that that are properties of the system

2282
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:58,440
that are fundamental underlying design

2283
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:02,760
choices that you users don't have a say

2284
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:06,120
in right and like the fact that people

2285
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:08,280
like these properties of these systems

2286
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,260
and can choose ones that have an open

2287
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:11,760
front door or like anybody can message

2288
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,320
you the way anyone if you have a

2289
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,580
telephone number can like hit you with a

2290
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:15,659
telephone number there's nothing you can

2291
01:35:15,659 --> 01:35:16,679
do about it

2292
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:18,780
social media has has fundamentally

2293
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:21,179
altered this Dynamic and to put this as

2294
01:35:21,179 --> 01:35:22,560
a way that well you know we need to like

2295
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,600
confront users to get them to like

2296
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,400
Express that that is what they actually

2297
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,840
want

2298
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,719
I think is unrealistic and it is really

2299
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:32,040
orthogonal to the problem we're trying

2300
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,380
to solve so can we maybe punt this one

2301
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,380
because this needs more discussion so

2302
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:39,900
John before you disappear is your

2303
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:43,440
suggestion that we

2304
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,600
get rid of the sentence in the charter

2305
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,540
and have the working group so Charter

2306
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,060
discuss how to do it or you want the

2307
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,639
list to discuss more what to put in the

2308
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:55,500
charter about this I I fear it is

2309
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,699
getting the list to discuss more about

2310
01:35:56,699 --> 01:35:58,080
to put in Charter about this because I

2311
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,520
think there is an unfortunate

2312
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,199
interaction between solving the

2313
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,840
introduction problem putting spam out of

2314
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,580
scope and having the statement about

2315
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,620
nonetheless we want to you know respect

2316
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:10,679
user preferences right and I believe

2317
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:13,560
those user preferences are cassette in

2318
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,760
every way that makes the introduction

2319
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,280
problem a problem at all like there is

2320
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,360
no introduction problem for telephone

2321
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:19,560
numbers you got a telephone number

2322
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:22,320
anybody can call it right it's the

2323
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,120
systems where you can't you don't have a

2324
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:26,159
front door like that that are designed

2325
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:28,440
to prevent that that necessitate an

2326
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,260
introduction problem and it is it is the

2327
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,600
one of the reasons those are successful

2328
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,820
is because of the implications of that

2329
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:38,340
for spam and abuse and suggesting that

2330
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:41,520
like this needs to be Express user

2331
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,380
preferences is where this came from and

2332
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,000
that's why I was like okay express it or

2333
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,880
implied because it is implied by voting

2334
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,320
with your feet when you go to a social

2335
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,420
network messaging system that you do not

2336
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,300
want to have an open front door

2337
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:56,880
so yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna contradict

2338
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,280
myself from 20 minutes ago

2339
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,980
um maybe

2340
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:03,840
uh do you not envision

2341
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,540
given the fact that all of the closed

2342
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:09,179
systems offer controls that that's where

2343
01:37:09,179 --> 01:37:10,380
this came from in the first place right

2344
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:11,639
if you're all of a sudden going to open

2345
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:13,739
up a closed system to people from other

2346
01:37:13,739 --> 01:37:16,500
non-closed systems who can reach you

2347
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,380
um that if you if you are already in a

2348
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:20,460
position where you're controlling who

2349
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:23,280
can reach you that better extend to this

2350
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,199
much larger interoperable system right

2351
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:26,820
so

2352
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:30,120
do you not Envision that the the

2353
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,739
services that already offer such

2354
01:37:31,739 --> 01:37:34,380
controls will not augment those controls

2355
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,480
with hey now people from signal can

2356
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,340
reach you are you okay with that like

2357
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:40,320
that and that's why I think I mean

2358
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,900
Mallory's point is perhaps that

2359
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:45,420
whatever's implicit today will have to

2360
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:46,980
become explicit

2361
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,900
because the users who signed up for

2362
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,340
these services that that's why they're

2363
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:52,020
there in the first place is because they

2364
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:53,520
have those controls so why would these

2365
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,080
like we can't make these services offer

2366
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,639
those controls but like don't you

2367
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:58,199
anticipate that they will come to exist

2368
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:00,300
anyway it is the former point that we

2369
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,820
can't force these systems to to make

2370
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:05,820
users make this choice right and to put

2371
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:08,159
it explicitly to them as a choice like

2372
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,199
if I if I thought Facebook was it was

2373
01:38:10,199 --> 01:38:11,520
going to give me a button I could push

2374
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,320
that said I'm an open front door like

2375
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,179
anybody can say I don't require anything

2376
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:17,460
for anybody to see anything right I mean

2377
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:19,980
maybe public posting is like that or you

2378
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:21,120
know maybe there are systems for like

2379
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:22,560
DMS and Twitter or where you can like

2380
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,179
set that and receive DMS from from

2381
01:38:24,179 --> 01:38:26,159
anyone those are examples of ways that

2382
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:28,080
that could be made explicit my point is

2383
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,300
if the default of these things and the

2384
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:32,520
way that the the the reason they have

2385
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,260
been successful is communication systems

2386
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:36,900
is because they do not their default out

2387
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:39,540
of the box behavior is to prevent users

2388
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:42,420
from having these you know like uh uh uh

2389
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:44,400
that that open front door I don't want

2390
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,560
to suggest we now need to force any

2391
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,120
system that is going to be compliant

2392
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,820
with Mimi to make people make that

2393
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:53,760
explicit Express user preference

2394
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,380
like identify before they can

2395
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:57,960
participate in the system

2396
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:00,000
does this again we need to take this

2397
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,699
list obviously but like I expressed an

2398
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:04,440
implied user preferences work for me

2399
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,480
removing this and just having user

2400
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,760
preferences does not does not work for

2401
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,920
me I think the same way

2402
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,560
okay thanks

2403
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:17,219
um okay go ahead Mark yeah just a quick

2404
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:19,380
question from a complete messaging

2405
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:21,900
newbie uh just the language must be

2406
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,699
respected there just strikes me as a bit

2407
01:39:23,699 --> 01:39:25,500
odd you know are we really saying that

2408
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,580
we're going to put a must in the

2409
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:28,860
specification that you must behave in

2410
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:30,360
this way when it's effectively

2411
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,520
untestable I mean that seems like it's

2412
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,739
something that would be uh uh uh

2413
01:39:34,739 --> 01:39:37,320
regulated by by legal forces but I'm not

2414
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:38,699
sure it's really about technical

2415
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:40,860
interoperably do we really mean must be

2416
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:42,780
respected or is it must be able to be

2417
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:44,460
expressed

2418
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:47,000
thank you

2419
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,500
I think there's

2420
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,800
ways to design some of the protocol

2421
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,280
mechanics that are envisioned here that

2422
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:05,059
uh

2423
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:07,679
that you could only do so without

2424
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:09,840
violating people's preferences or that

2425
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,460
like would demand violation of people's

2426
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:13,500
preferences so it's sort of trying to

2427
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,780
put a gate on that but I agree with you

2428
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:17,699
like yes there's a lot of this that

2429
01:40:17,699 --> 01:40:19,260
cannot be enforced in whatever it is

2430
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:20,760
that we're going to specify I think that

2431
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,900
probably depends on the nature of the

2432
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,699
specific preferences in some cases and

2433
01:40:23,699 --> 01:40:25,739
that's why especially the the data

2434
01:40:25,739 --> 01:40:27,239
residency one really to me brings that

2435
01:40:27,239 --> 01:40:28,679
out is like how are you going to enforce

2436
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:30,960
that in the protocol you know

2437
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,040
um yeah okay thanks

2438
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:38,639
okay this might be unpopular but

2439
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,620
basically we've got the completely wrong

2440
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:42,420
language here

2441
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:44,179
this is not the introduction problem

2442
01:40:44,179 --> 01:40:48,500
this is the access control problem

2443
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:51,000
that front door that John was talking

2444
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,800
about yes he's got that completely right

2445
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,880
yeah every message that I receive over

2446
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,400
an instant message channel is access

2447
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,580
controlled because you can't talk to me

2448
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:06,060
on Signal unless I've already decided to

2449
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,440
accept

2450
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,900
Communications from me

2451
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:12,020
the only thing that you can send without

2452
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:15,840
uh prior authorization is a request for

2453
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,280
authorization

2454
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,159
so really what we've got here is an

2455
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:22,980
authorization problem and you have to

2456
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:25,860
have a mechanism that allows somebody to

2457
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:28,440
set up an authorization in the first

2458
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:29,460
place

2459
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:31,500
and you have to have an access control

2460
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,619
system so that people can say I do not

2461
01:41:34,619 --> 01:41:37,080
want J random fascist sending

2462
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:40,920
information into my messaging box

2463
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,560
is an access control problem and so I

2464
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,060
you know I don't think we can really

2465
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,460
word Smith this I think we've got to go

2466
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:49,020
back and cast it in those terms because

2467
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,760
once you do that

2468
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:53,580
the whole bit about Express user

2469
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:54,840
preferences no no they're not

2470
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,820
preferences they're Access Control

2471
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:58,500
policy

2472
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,480
and the user has to be in control of

2473
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:04,020
that and that goes to the heart of what

2474
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:04,619
um

2475
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:07,199
AOL and signal and so on are saying when

2476
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:10,619
they want uh anti-spam built in

2477
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:12,719
they want to protect those existing

2478
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:14,880
access controls

2479
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,440
so

2480
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,119
thanks

2481
01:42:18,119 --> 01:42:21,480
um so what I'm hearing right now and

2482
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:23,400
just in case people don't need to get to

2483
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,380
the mic what I'm hearing right now is

2484
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:28,619
this PR doesn't address the problem

2485
01:42:28,619 --> 01:42:31,080
that's being expressed here and this

2486
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,460
really does need to go back to the list

2487
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:35,280
and this paragraph needs to be reviewed

2488
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,100
and and figure out what text we want to

2489
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:40,139
express what people are talking about

2490
01:42:40,139 --> 01:42:41,639
here

2491
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:44,580
um if you want to express your agreement

2492
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:46,080
or disagreement with that that would be

2493
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,580
helpful

2494
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:49,679
yeah I'm going to close the cue on this

2495
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,239
so get in the queue if you have anything

2496
01:42:51,239 --> 01:42:53,940
else to say Jonathan yeah Jonathan

2497
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:56,400
Rosenberg um I I think almost all of

2498
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,659
this is stuff that should happen in the

2499
01:42:57,659 --> 01:42:59,880
working group and not in the charter I

2500
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:01,860
I'm not a fan of protocol engineering

2501
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:04,380
via indirection in the charter everyone

2502
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:05,880
who has all these strong opinions on

2503
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,860
identity and preferences and implied

2504
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:10,320
versus explicit can we just do this in

2505
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,719
the working group because instead of

2506
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:15,540
like asking for delaying of another you

2507
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:16,500
know three months to make a working

2508
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:17,400
group

2509
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,020
just let's get a working group and have

2510
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:21,119
this debate and I say that because I

2511
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,560
think a lot of this discussion is losing

2512
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,119
sight of what the objective of this is

2513
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:27,179
we are not here to design the messaging

2514
01:43:27,179 --> 01:43:29,159
system in world of messaging we wish we

2515
01:43:29,159 --> 01:43:31,139
had that is not the charter of this

2516
01:43:31,139 --> 01:43:31,920
group

2517
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,659
there are existing providers and they

2518
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:34,860
sell the products and they have the

2519
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:36,540
policies and they make the decisions

2520
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:37,920
they've already made and it's not our

2521
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,900
job to tell them to do something else

2522
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,460
our job is to provide a way for them to

2523
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:43,860
interoperate and we need to solve the

2524
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:45,659
just the protocol mechanisms necessary

2525
01:43:45,659 --> 01:43:47,159
to facilitate that interoperability

2526
01:43:47,159 --> 01:43:49,139
that's what we're here to do

2527
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:51,179
so I would love to sort of conclude on

2528
01:43:51,179 --> 01:43:52,560
the charter text and I'm pretty much

2529
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,119
happy with whatever because we're going

2530
01:43:54,119 --> 01:43:55,199
to have it all over again in the working

2531
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:57,119
group and we do no benefit to ourselves

2532
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:59,460
by delaying it

2533
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,260
and the dma has a deadline in case

2534
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,420
people didn't know this so if we want

2535
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:05,460
anything to actually be used

2536
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,260
another round of Charter negotiation

2537
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:10,340
helps nobody

2538
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,199
so I guess just looking at the time

2539
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:14,639
because we do need to get to the buff

2540
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:15,659
questions

2541
01:44:15,659 --> 01:44:18,540
um if anybody

2542
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:20,460
disagrees with what Jonathan just said

2543
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:22,440
in terms of like needing to continue

2544
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,360
hashing this out

2545
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:24,960
um

2546
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,179
outside of the charter context then

2547
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:30,320
please come to the mic

2548
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:32,960
to

2549
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:39,900
uh Ted Hardy scope Enthusiast also buff

2550
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,639
question enthusiasts I'll try and be

2551
01:44:41,639 --> 01:44:44,820
very fast I I think that um the way

2552
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:46,440
Jonathan just described this is actually

2553
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:48,540
a bigger task than we actually have

2554
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:50,280
because he talked about it as service

2555
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:53,040
interoperability across uh all of the

2556
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:55,440
conforming services but I think some of

2557
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,600
what's going on here that's problematic

2558
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,360
for us to understand is actually goes

2559
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,860
back to the formulation that Brian had

2560
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:03,540
at the very beginning you can think

2561
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:05,820
about this as every time you have one of

2562
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:07,500
these chats or channels or conversations

2563
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,460
you're building an overlay that overlay

2564
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:14,400
has multiple Services as underlying

2565
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,820
providers for that chat or conversation

2566
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:22,139
or Channel and that overlay may have its

2567
01:45:22,139 --> 01:45:25,020
own defaults which are not inherited

2568
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:28,800
from any one of those and I think part

2569
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,780
of the thing that the working group has

2570
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:33,780
to Define is how when you're building

2571
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:36,420
one of these overlaid conversations or

2572
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:39,719
channels Etc you get that

2573
01:45:39,719 --> 01:45:41,340
um inheritance and there are a variety

2574
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:43,020
of ways of doing it that the working

2575
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:44,880
group has to design and the charter

2576
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,560
isn't

2577
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,900
um required to design but I think it's

2578
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:51,000
really important that we keep in our

2579
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,760
brains that we are not trying to solve

2580
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,820
the problem of service interoperability

2581
01:45:55,820 --> 01:46:00,119
broadly it's per overlay we have to

2582
01:46:00,119 --> 01:46:01,500
solve it and that's a much more

2583
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,659
constrained problem and that's good

2584
01:46:03,659 --> 01:46:06,480
because trying to solve it and the full

2585
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,100
interoperability of all the different

2586
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,040
aspects of these different Services is

2587
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,199
not going to meet the dma deadlines and

2588
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:14,639
it's not going to be a solvable problem

2589
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:16,860
with the enthusiasm but if we

2590
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:19,139
conceptualize this that way

2591
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:22,139
I think we can understand these buff

2592
01:46:22,139 --> 01:46:25,380
questions in a much more useful hey can

2593
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:28,440
I get this done and I'm much happier

2594
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:31,560
saying yes to those buff questions than

2595
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,480
what I think Jonathan didn't actually

2596
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:36,138
mean to say

2597
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,239
okay I mean and I think there think the

2598
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:41,460
rod appreciation for that

2599
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:43,260
um that we're trying to be more narrow

2600
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:45,420
in scope and maybe we need to refine it

2601
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:47,880
a little bit to get there

2602
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,400
um

2603
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:52,260
my only ask I was going to say is just

2604
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:53,880
given the timing of everything I wish

2605
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:55,679
that we could resolve right now some

2606
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:57,179
texts that we could put into the charter

2607
01:46:57,179 --> 01:46:58,500
that sort of hit this because everyone

2608
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,000
seems to be saying roughly the same

2609
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,020
thing this should be left to the working

2610
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:02,639
group

2611
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:05,940
thank you yeah so I yeah I think we'll

2612
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:09,739
we'll continue iterating on this

2613
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:11,760
um a little bit on the sideline of the

2614
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,380
meeting but I think we need to get on to

2615
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:15,420
the boff questions I'm quite happy for

2616
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:17,400
this to drop Matthew from Matrix

2617
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,540
um it's not going to be blocking the

2618
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:20,340
working group I was just trying to get

2619
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:22,199
it on the table so if we don't want to

2620
01:47:22,199 --> 01:47:23,639
put it on the table very happy to close

2621
01:47:23,639 --> 01:47:25,560
the pr and I've said so on it great

2622
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:27,060
thank you I think that would be helpful

2623
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:29,300
thanks

2624
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:31,679
okay I I know we didn't get to every

2625
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:33,480
single Charter aspect that people wanted

2626
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,560
to discuss

2627
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:35,639
um but obviously we're going to keep

2628
01:47:35,639 --> 01:47:37,139
iterating on some of these points on the

2629
01:47:37,139 --> 01:47:39,000
list and if there's one that you really

2630
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,380
wanted to raise and we didn't get to

2631
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:43,260
discuss it please file an issue or a PR

2632
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:45,900
or raise it on the list and um obviously

2633
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:47,100
we're going to be continuing to refine

2634
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,260
the charter after this meeting so

2635
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,840
um we have time to do that but we are

2636
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,000
going to move on to the boff questions

2637
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,760
we're going to be asking to help so the

2638
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:57,960
point of these questions for those who

2639
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:59,520
are new to this process is to help

2640
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,699
inform our responsible area director who

2641
01:48:02,699 --> 01:48:04,080
is helpfully standing now at the front

2642
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:07,679
of the room Marie and the rest of the

2643
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,020
iesg as they

2644
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:11,699
um

2645
01:48:11,699 --> 01:48:13,560
think about whether this working group

2646
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,540
should be chartered and put the charter

2647
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:17,340
out for Community review

2648
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:19,380
so the first question is

2649
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:21,420
does anyone think the problem statement

2650
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:24,179
that we discussed earlier in that Rowan

2651
01:48:24,179 --> 01:48:28,440
presented is unclear or poorly scoped if

2652
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:30,000
you think it's unclear or poorly scoped

2653
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,619
please come to the microphone David

2654
01:48:38,420 --> 01:48:42,000
yes I'm David uh I think there's one

2655
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,340
issue around scoping and this is

2656
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:45,659
slightly related to the Charter

2657
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:49,340
apologies for that but I think it is

2658
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:52,080
somewhat problematic that the problem

2659
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,199
statement explicitly places a lot of

2660
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:58,199
this permanent abuse questions semi out

2661
01:48:58,199 --> 01:48:59,639
of scope

2662
01:48:59,639 --> 01:49:02,340
um I'm I'm worried about the impact

2663
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,080
that's gonna have

2664
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,340
on

2665
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:08,760
the Solutions we eventually are going to

2666
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,320
end up with and and the kind of

2667
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,960
environment that that is going to create

2668
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,080
because we might accidentally dig a very

2669
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,600
big hole in terms of either a toxic

2670
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,520
environment or a outright from a

2671
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,719
security standpoint dangerous

2672
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:23,520
environment

2673
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,560
thank you please get in the queue if you

2674
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,719
have opinions about that Jim

2675
01:49:27,719 --> 01:49:30,360
uh the uh the the chart the draft

2676
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,340
Charter that's uh seems to talk about

2677
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:35,040
the motivation being strictly about user

2678
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:38,400
experience whereas Bruins draft talks

2679
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,600
about the dma and so if we're needing to

2680
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,219
satisfy and I've heard a lot of talk

2681
01:49:44,219 --> 01:49:47,520
about mentions of the dma here if we're

2682
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,679
needing to satisfy a particular

2683
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:52,199
regulatory requirement or that's a goal

2684
01:49:52,199 --> 01:49:54,540
of this of this working group I think it

2685
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:55,739
should be mentioned in the charter

2686
01:49:55,739 --> 01:49:58,440
because uh right now it just seems to be

2687
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:01,199
about the uh about user experience and

2688
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,699
our experience has been that user

2689
01:50:02,699 --> 01:50:05,820
experience is not sufficient to get

2690
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:08,540
something deployed

2691
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:11,820
thanks yeah we left it out of the

2692
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:13,500
charter because it's an unconventional

2693
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,900
thing to do in ITF Charters that is in

2694
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,639
the it's like in the buff request

2695
01:50:17,639 --> 01:50:18,780
description

2696
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:20,580
um but I think and there are some backup

2697
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:22,739
slides in this deck that you can peruse

2698
01:50:22,739 --> 01:50:25,739
at your own Leisure that explains some

2699
01:50:25,739 --> 01:50:28,800
of the dma requirements um but I think

2700
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,500
in general we try not to be have that as

2701
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,719
the basis it is it's obviously a

2702
01:50:33,719 --> 01:50:34,800
motivator

2703
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,780
um but if you if you look at that and

2704
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:38,639
you think that it has an impact on the

2705
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,560
problem statement scope that would be

2706
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,520
useful

2707
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,020
um I think it's actually stated at a

2708
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:44,400
very high level what the requirements

2709
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,800
are on The Gatekeepers under the dma so

2710
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:47,820
I think everything we've talked about

2711
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:49,679
today is potentially within within that

2712
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:50,580
scope

2713
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:51,840
Victoria

2714
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,940
yes well I actually wanted to say the

2715
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,260
two things that have been said but yeah

2716
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:57,780
just briefly the the I also think that

2717
01:50:57,780 --> 01:50:59,580
it's important that yes we Define the

2718
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:00,960
minimal requirements but they meet at

2719
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,460
least the requirements that are posed by

2720
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,560
regulatory requirements around the world

2721
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,480
otherwise the work the work is useless

2722
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,159
I'm fine with not stating this in the

2723
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:09,719
chat if we don't feel like I mean at the

2724
01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:11,580
ITF but it must be a clear agreement

2725
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:13,380
between the people in the room and the

2726
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:15,540
other one is about spam I think that

2727
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:17,100
there's a real risk that we I mean if we

2728
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:18,540
don't address the problem at least start

2729
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:20,880
discussing how it could impact we end up

2730
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,199
with something which will fail because

2731
01:51:22,199 --> 01:51:23,699
people will try to deploy it and then it

2732
01:51:23,699 --> 01:51:24,960
will be immediately used to spam

2733
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,119
everyone else and and the main players

2734
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:28,260
in the field we say we don't

2735
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:29,460
interoperate because this is just

2736
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:31,320
opening up too much spam and abuse and

2737
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:33,480
abuse not just pain but also harassment

2738
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:35,880
and all these kinds of abuses so I I

2739
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:37,800
think we should if possible at least uh

2740
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:39,540
put it as a second I mean this later

2741
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:41,280
goal maybe but not through it out

2742
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,320
completely

2743
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:46,400
thank you Eric

2744
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,639
so I don't think we should say anything

2745
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,500
about dma in the charter um I understand

2746
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,179
it's motivating for why this work was

2747
01:51:54,179 --> 01:51:56,280
more successful but I don't think we I

2748
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,139
think trying to be like we're not like

2749
01:51:58,139 --> 01:52:00,960
the consultancy for like the for the EU

2750
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:03,659
so um our jobs recently that's good and

2751
01:52:03,659 --> 01:52:05,699
that does does will serve those

2752
01:52:05,699 --> 01:52:07,080
requirements but I've read I've read the

2753
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:08,100
requirements and they're really quite

2754
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:10,080
vague so um so I don't really think

2755
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,900
there's much fear that like that like uh

2756
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:15,000
that that will fail to hit those

2757
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,280
um if we do a proper job otherwise I'm

2758
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:18,780
also sensitive to this point John

2759
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:20,340
Peterson is another people raised about

2760
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:22,380
spam and abuse um

2761
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:24,960
I I'm really torn um I don't think as

2762
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:27,239
much I think maybe maybe like there's a

2763
01:52:27,239 --> 01:52:29,280
question between

2764
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,560
um you know we are not going to solve

2765
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:32,880
spament abuse

2766
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,100
um ever but um even here especially

2767
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:36,540
because those are like very platform

2768
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:38,699
specific ways of handling it what we

2769
01:52:38,699 --> 01:52:40,199
need to do um you know and if you think

2770
01:52:40,199 --> 01:52:41,820
of the email situation you know we

2771
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:43,260
didn't try to solve family abuse and

2772
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:44,520
email either we tried to get the plot

2773
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,139
the applications of platform is the

2774
01:52:46,139 --> 01:52:48,300
ability to handle themselves and so I

2775
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:49,739
think you know if we were able to like

2776
01:52:49,739 --> 01:52:52,860
come up with a a consistent um you know

2777
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:54,719
set of functionality which would enable

2778
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:56,100
platforms to handle sound abuse we

2779
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:57,480
should do that

2780
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,940
um I I not feel comfortable I understand

2781
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:01,260
the situation well enough to be able to

2782
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:02,940
do that at the moment um I wonder if

2783
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,260
there's a way to sort of finesse this a

2784
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:05,760
little bit the charter interest like I

2785
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:07,320
mean having room for like in the same

2786
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,940
ways we made room for a discovery thing

2787
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:10,380
make room for make room for protocol

2788
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:12,719
support for that if we then need it um

2789
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:14,760
like I say I I feel like that's like not

2790
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:16,139
entirely adequate but it's the best I

2791
01:53:16,139 --> 01:53:18,960
know how to do so there we are and just

2792
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,659
to point out not that it is a crystal

2793
01:53:21,659 --> 01:53:23,820
clear distinction but this question is

2794
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:26,580
about the general problem statement the

2795
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:28,139
specifics of the charter is another

2796
01:53:28,139 --> 01:53:30,840
question but I agree there they're tied

2797
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,340
together my answer to this question is

2798
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:35,580
no I think it is fine okay thank you I'm

2799
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:36,840
going to close the queue on this

2800
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,000
question go ahead Matthew I'm Matthew

2801
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,080
Wilde

2802
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:43,139
um so I I completely sympathize with the

2803
01:53:43,139 --> 01:53:45,659
um the point about not wanting to make

2804
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:48,480
the whole uh working group about the dma

2805
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:50,760
I think that's very sensible

2806
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,980
um but I also worry that if we don't uh

2807
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:55,080
recognize that as a goal at all and I

2808
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:57,060
think it is implied as a goal because we

2809
01:53:57,060 --> 01:53:58,920
keep talking about it

2810
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:02,219
um we run the risk of possibly defining

2811
01:54:02,219 --> 01:54:03,900
solutions that are not acceptable to The

2812
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:06,420
Gatekeepers for example and go uh too

2813
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:08,219
far in one direction for example the

2814
01:54:08,219 --> 01:54:10,020
spam and abuse is is obviously a big

2815
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,540
concern to any big player and it is one

2816
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:14,040
of the reasons that they don't just

2817
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,139
interoperate with anyone and if we

2818
01:54:16,139 --> 01:54:18,300
neglect to address that kind kind of

2819
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:20,219
thing then I worry that we'll end up

2820
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:22,380
doing all this interoperability work and

2821
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:24,179
no one will end up actually adopting it

2822
01:54:24,179 --> 01:54:26,460
and yeah we've had you know we've been

2823
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:27,960
through this in the past and a lot of

2824
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,340
the reason that

2825
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,920
um you know say for example xmpp um is

2826
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,960
no longer implemented is not necessarily

2827
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:35,400
because of the technical reasons but a

2828
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,260
lot of the you know um business and

2829
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:39,540
operations that go along with operating

2830
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:42,000
a massive service and and so we need to

2831
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,619
be you know we need to recognize those

2832
01:54:43,619 --> 01:54:45,420
things

2833
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:49,560
thank you Rowan uh so from my

2834
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:51,360
perspective spam is specifically

2835
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:54,000
mentioned in the problem statement and

2836
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,639
in the charter it's listed as that that

2837
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:59,340
there's some text about

2838
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:01,920
you know basically let's get the ball

2839
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,500
rolling and then what we can go and do

2840
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:05,639
this

2841
01:55:05,639 --> 01:55:07,199
we can go and do this a little bit later

2842
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:09,840
so that's my understanding is that the

2843
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,000
problem statement does include doing

2844
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,119
spam metadata uh and that there is a

2845
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:16,260
mention of it specifically in the

2846
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:17,460
charter

2847
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:20,400
thanks Jonathan yeah Jonathan Rosenberg

2848
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:22,920
so I think the probability that spam is

2849
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:25,260
not considered in the discussion is

2850
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:28,260
exactly zero

2851
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:30,119
um it's sort of like should we worry

2852
01:55:30,119 --> 01:55:32,219
about security how about like backwards

2853
01:55:32,219 --> 01:55:35,340
compatibility extensibility like of

2854
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:36,719
course we're all going to do those

2855
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:37,980
things too do they need to be in the

2856
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:39,900
charter every single one of them I don't

2857
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:41,100
think so

2858
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,420
um I think everyone who's working on

2859
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:43,860
this understands the risks and the

2860
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:46,380
challenges without a doubt to me I think

2861
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:48,179
it's fine as it is we're going to work

2862
01:55:48,179 --> 01:55:50,159
on those things I think the main point

2863
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:52,560
is this group's Charter is not to

2864
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,139
specifically design

2865
01:55:54,139 --> 01:55:56,760
protocols whose primary functions are

2866
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:58,980
spam abuse where and this is why I think

2867
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:00,659
what ecker's saying is right we're

2868
01:56:00,659 --> 01:56:02,040
building a messaging interop system

2869
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,679
which has many design considerations all

2870
01:56:04,679 --> 01:56:06,119
of which do not need to be enumerated in

2871
01:56:06,119 --> 01:56:08,060
the charter which is obviously inclusive

2872
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:11,699
of Trying to minimize spam

2873
01:56:11,699 --> 01:56:14,760
thanks John yeah and I I do think the

2874
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,320
problem statement is I think it's pretty

2875
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:19,380
clear to most folks here and I think the

2876
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:21,300
way it's been articulated is fine I mean

2877
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:24,360
on on the spam thing again I raise this

2878
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,340
just to make sure that the way that the

2879
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,719
charter text is going to capture that

2880
01:56:27,719 --> 01:56:29,639
aspect of the problem statement actually

2881
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:31,619
encompassed the way that some of these

2882
01:56:31,619 --> 01:56:33,480
messaging systems behave right and I

2883
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:34,800
think we all here know how those missing

2884
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,719
systems behave we've events that we can

2885
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:38,760
work this out in the working group

2886
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:40,800
thank you so we have four minutes left

2887
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,880
and we have four questions left

2888
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:45,840
um so we're going to move on unless you

2889
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,639
have objections to that okay does anyone

2890
01:56:47,639 --> 01:56:49,139
think the ietf is not an appropriate

2891
01:56:49,139 --> 01:56:51,179
venue for solving the problems we've

2892
01:56:51,179 --> 01:56:53,760
talked about today

2893
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,619
oh sorry yeah I'm just going to leave

2894
01:56:55,619 --> 01:56:59,420
the cue locked so nobody can object

2895
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,199
going once

2896
01:57:04,199 --> 01:57:06,659
going twice

2897
01:57:06,659 --> 01:57:09,239
good okay

2898
01:57:09,239 --> 01:57:10,800
does anyone object to forming a working

2899
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:13,619
group with the proposed Charter module

2900
01:57:13,619 --> 01:57:15,360
of changes discussed today obviously we

2901
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,400
have we have more refinements that we

2902
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:19,560
need to discuss on introduction and

2903
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:21,840
Discovery Express user preferences

2904
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,360
potentially spam

2905
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:26,940
um data residency and metadata

2906
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:29,880
but we've had robust discussion I have

2907
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:31,500
confidence that we will uh you know

2908
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:34,020
reach some some agreements on those bits

2909
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:37,139
of text so modulo all of that happening

2910
01:57:37,139 --> 01:57:39,420
does anybody object to forming a working

2911
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:41,340
group with approximately the charter

2912
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:44,540
scope that we've been discussing

2913
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:51,239
are you in the queue okay thank you go

2914
01:57:51,239 --> 01:57:53,880
ahead fine fine

2915
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,900
um uh uh no idea object but I I think I

2916
01:57:57,900 --> 01:57:59,580
I you know I think it's cool to ask some

2917
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:00,599
of these questions the negative I think

2918
01:58:00,599 --> 01:58:01,560
here will be guys to have some

2919
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:04,500
affirmative show of support

2920
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,480
you want to take us to come or something

2921
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,099
yeah I mean I support this but I just

2922
01:58:08,099 --> 01:58:09,420
think like to be helpful to the 80s is

2923
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:10,679
uniform to show support that this is

2924
01:58:10,679 --> 01:58:15,360
good work not just no complaint Brian

2925
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:21,060
oh okay okay

2926
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:24,239
um well we can take a hum so

2927
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:28,020
um I'll do it off the cuff here so so

2928
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:29,760
there's going to be two questions oh do

2929
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:30,960
we need to use the poll because it's

2930
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:31,860
remote

2931
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:32,580
yeah

2932
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:34,380
and this is why I like asking the

2933
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:37,500
negative questions but what about let's

2934
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:38,639
just take a show of support in the room

2935
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:41,280
you can take a hum yes so so we'll get

2936
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:43,560
support in the room and if you're in the

2937
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:45,840
chat uh part of our remote participants

2938
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,119
please plus one this

2939
01:58:48,119 --> 01:58:50,699
um do folks in the positive version of

2940
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:53,280
this question modulo the change is

2941
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,739
discussed today think that forming or

2942
01:58:55,739 --> 01:58:57,420
working with approximately proposed

2943
01:58:57,420 --> 01:58:59,159
Charter is a good thing

2944
01:58:59,159 --> 01:59:02,159
and

2945
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:07,080
several plus ones so we had heard no

2946
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:09,119
objection when we asked the question and

2947
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:11,340
we got lots of plus ones and hums in the

2948
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:13,260
room when we asked the positive question

2949
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:15,659
that seems like a uh

2950
01:59:15,659 --> 01:59:17,760
a good show of support

2951
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,239
okay yes

2952
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:25,759
okay we're taking names

2953
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:29,639
okay and I'm I'm literally uh going to

2954
01:59:29,639 --> 01:59:31,800
ask for people remote to please put

2955
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:35,460
their names in uh just so I want you if

2956
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:36,840
you're remote or if you're in the room

2957
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:38,699
and you're on the chat

2958
01:59:38,699 --> 01:59:40,380
um if you are willing to review

2959
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:42,840
documents please type the word review if

2960
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:45,060
you are willing to serve as an author or

2961
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:47,219
an editor please type the word author

2962
01:59:47,219 --> 01:59:49,080
editor if you are willing to chair

2963
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:51,960
please type that word but I will ask in

2964
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:54,900
the room for uh uh arms to be thrown in

2965
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:57,000
the air as necessary

2966
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,619
um do we have folks willing to review

2967
01:59:58,619 --> 02:00:00,119
documents

2968
02:00:00,119 --> 02:00:02,699
okay so a good three quarters of the

2969
02:00:02,699 --> 02:00:04,679
room raised their hand I I'm that I

2970
02:00:04,679 --> 02:00:06,300
wasn't too worried about

2971
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:09,540
um are there folks who are willing to uh

2972
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:12,780
author documents or edit documents

2973
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:15,659
okay so I I don't know that I know all

2974
02:00:15,659 --> 02:00:17,580
the faces here

2975
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:21,780
um I know uh okay do we wanna uh can the

2976
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:23,099
uh

2977
02:00:23,099 --> 02:00:25,440

bad that I asked the semi-scope question

3053
02:03:55,739 --> 02:03:57,860
after

3054
02:03:58,500 --> 02:03:59,639
