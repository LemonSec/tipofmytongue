1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,540
any instructions sitting around

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,480
we might have I might have to be

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,779
this I can't make it do anything

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,259
so

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
um

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,920
crazy

7
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,660
yes

8
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,260
am I logged in

9
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,820
okay

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,140
full client with video

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,299
use microphone no

12
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,960


13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,200
his camera no

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
problem sweet

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,680
here we are

16
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,720
yeah

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,600
I blocked audio I blocked the camera and

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,259
the mic

19
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,840
okay

20
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,100
so now we need

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,880
that's so weird it doesn't show up here

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,819
okay so has uh anybody else chaired a

23
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,299
meeting yet

24
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,680
does the thing on does your laptop on

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,180
the right actually work to do anything

26
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,720
no

27
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,540
yeah you got to use your own

28

um

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,360
I'll let you prove it like I'll let you

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,920
present this but let me

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,599
let me make sure I can control it

34
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,800
oh did you want to control it

35
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,620
all right well welcome to the LSR

36
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,519
working group at itf115

37
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,239
um

38
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,959

please note well

40
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,660
a lot to read there so

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,040
again you're gonna

42
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,140

there

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,440
good morning everybody you can all hear

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,859
me right

48
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,920
before we before we get on I'd like to

49
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,900
recognize my former working group chair

50
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,140
he's with us after a long time Abby Roy

51
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,540
[Applause]

52
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,700
and with that I'm gonna get right into

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,879
the working group status we had a really

54
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,120
productive uh space of time between 14

55
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,440
and uh 15. got all these Yang models

56
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,640
Ying Jen's going to cover them in her

57
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,760
presentation next slide

58
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,879
now here we got all these drafts not

59
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,780
only

60
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,959
uh John did a lot of work excellent work

61
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,019
I mean it was

62
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,918
it was uh getting all these and uh

63
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,199
getting and uh Peter uh and uh drove and

64
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,740
uh well uh even even the viz document

65
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,780
there were some that lasted we got all

66
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,900
these not only through the 80 review but

67
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,759
through all the directorate reviews and

68
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,100
through the isg and they're on the RFC Q

69
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,940
this is uh significant the flex algae

70
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,340
algorithms That's the basis for a lot of

71
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,720
the draft working group graphs we got

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,160
today next slide

73
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,620
we still have this but once Flex

74
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,419
algorithm

75
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,860
is

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,080
um I guess it'll be published as a

77
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,880
cluster

78
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,979
I probably should have updated this

79
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,560
because Flex algorithm is now an rfcq

80
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,280
next slide

81
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,780
and

82
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,720
uh we got the flood

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,900
uh reflection uh John and Peter actually

84
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,960
got got through the A.D review on that

85
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,520
the director because that's going to be

86
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,040
in the telechat early next

87
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,780
um month

88
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,100
the

89
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,639
post extension says rv6 correspond to

90
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,699
the Isis ones there's some

91
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,000
um we went through a few iterations with

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,880
that and we just finished the ospf

93
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,120
terminology has publication requested it

94
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
does no longer need a routing director

95
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,100
review Sue Harris did that and it's it's

96
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,560
ready for um

97
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,560
uh ad review as well

98
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,340
next slide

99
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,080
Let's see we got this one

100
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,860
we we covered this this on the list this

101
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,500
one where this is the one where I'm

102
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,419
talking to some of the implementers ospf

103
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,039
V3

104
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,860
to make sure that the 24-bit metric it's

105
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,720
all right to use that to make the uh

106
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,000
base

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,180
um a prefix unreachable in the base

108
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,120
topology for inter tra area routes

109
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,020
currently it's used for inter and

110
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,360
external routes but we're we want to

111
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,280
extend that this will really be useful

112
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,319
it'll be just the same for all the route

113
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,880
types next slide

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,560
we're going to cover all these Yang

115
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,620
documents in Ying Zen's presentation

116
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,460
next slide

117
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,680
fast flooding I think we're pretty much

118
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,900
there we're gonna that was that draft

119
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,539
generated a lot of uh

120
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,060
a lot of interest and we've had some

121
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,560
implementations

122
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,900
it's not something that you know you

123
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,699
have to standardize what you do

124
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,340
internally but we've gotten uh Bruno did

125
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,440
some good work on the um

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,280
the uh signaling to signal

127
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,900
just the right amount of information

128
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,780
between neighbors so that the flooding

129
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,419
can adjust to the conditions

130
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,639
of the router

131
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,800
receiving them

132
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,419
and

133
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:25,860
I don't know if you followed it we have

134
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,919
these two that Wes is doing a uh

135
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,539
uh there were there were some things we

136
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,520
couldn't fix in an erratica in the

137
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,240
application specific metrics for Isis

138
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,419
and ospf so let's start at the ball and

139
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,639
uh Peter's doing the other one and we're

140
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,039
fixing them we got some other

141
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,720
while we were doing it we're not making

142
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,759
any big changes but there were some

143
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,380
other places that needed clarifications

144
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,960
in those drafts we're doing those too

145
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,220
I think

146
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,199
they could they could probably go pretty

147
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,560
quickly if just a matter of I want to

148
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,840
read them once over and encourage

149
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,039
everybody to read those two next slide

150
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,580
foreign

151
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,360
's going to cover

152
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,099
next slide

153
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,940
and

154
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,800
I'll say the ospf generalized transport

155
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,479
that's been renamed I'm gonna I'm gonna

156
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,460
have a you're gonna get to hear me talk

157
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,340
again today so let's cover that

158
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,080
next slide

159
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,700
I don't think I need to say anything

160
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,979
about any of these other ones the

161
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,559
extended hierarchy that was a lot of

162
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,299
good work but we thought that it was a

163
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,700
it was enough

164
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,680
of a significant change to Isis we'd

165
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,899
really want to let it Park Until

166
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,480
somebody implemented it

167
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,200
and the uh

168
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,220
the main offer Tony Lee has said that

169
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,480
there's no

170
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,940
the the the

171
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,100
impetus to input to implement it has has

172
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,000
gone away

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,800
and so

174
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,080
he I I think he I think I think he

175
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,459
agreed with me that we should just wait

176
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,820
on this one until somebody implements it

177
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,160
if you know right now Isis of course has

178
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,440
level one level two this would extended

179
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,440
n levels I forget what it was 16 or

180
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,700
something

181
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,680
and I think that's the only one I want

182
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,180
to talk about on this slide last slide

183
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,260
okay

184
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,660
I know we have some uh documents that

185
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,100
people are wanting working group class

186
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,740
calls on I didn't cover this but uh

187
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,320
please remind us on the lists or send us

188
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,420
you know you know I know we have some at

189
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,940
least a couple adoption call requests

190
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,420
from uh offers of other graphs

191
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,260
that's it

192
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,480
all right

193
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,160
I have an agenda

194
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,380
we have games yet yeah that's the Yang

195
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,360
documents right so I I'll present

196
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,300
do you know that was there

197
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,100
at least one I said do you know there

198
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,959
was a mic there

199
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,000
no no there's something like that's it

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,980
oh yeah I like this one you're like the

201
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,580
rock star yeah

202
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,000
yeah I like the Rockstar too

203
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,100
sure

204
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,800
all right looks like it's up

205
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,120
um

206
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,880
good morning everyone uh this is yinchen

207
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,300
I'm going to do an update of the SSR

208
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,420
young models so um I'm now going to

209
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,000
follow you with other model details so

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,120
this one is mainly a joke map of all the

211
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,600
SR RSI young models so

212
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,860
next slide please

213
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,339
okay so we finally published

214
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:10,820
the assets and ospf based model also rxc

215
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,519
9134 the young model for Isis reverse

216
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,779
metric

217
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,140
so last time I did a young update was at

218
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,140
the ATF in Singapore three years ago

219
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,540
that's the time when we were we were

220
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,500
happy the both space models were in the

221
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,680
RFC editor Cube so

222
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,680
three years later we made it we finally

223
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,680
published and so with those two base

224
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,019
model published and

225
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,720
that made all the protocol extension

226
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,500
modules augmenting those two base models

227
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,000
the publication possible

228
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:55,019
um so the next few models we want to

229
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,160
publish like um the both ospf and the

230
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,220
ISS Israel model so these two were

231
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,180
pretty much ready and the Isis Sr model

232
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,980
actually already finished the young

233
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,620
doctor last call reveal and we need to

234
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,620
do the same thing for ospf SRM and the

235
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,140
ospf V3 Sr young so all these three are

236
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,899
for mprs data plane and that one will

237
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,060
actually sort of forgot it we need to do

238
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,279
the working group adoption cup because

239
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,779
we were waiting for the base model

240
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,320
anyway so we didn't hurry and that one

241
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,360
will probably need to speed up a little

242
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,140
bit

243
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,820
and so this will publish the uh I try to

244
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,779
publish the Isis and ospf exam first

245
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,779
England can I ask a question

246
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:47,160
it took us three years do you think that

247
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,860
was our fault like just to do like do a

248
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,620
little debrief here was that our fault

249
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,320
or the process or what do you think

250
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,399
well

251
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,480
um

252
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,180
you can say it's our fault

253
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,579
waiting for the PFD module to publish

254
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:05,760
because we have a dependency on the vfd

255
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,320
model Jeff has it there and so after the

256
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,959
PFT module published we found some

257
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,959
problems and the BFD model had to do a

258
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,200
base version so three years later oh

259
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
okay I just wanted to make sure if we

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,579
did something bad we could fix it yeah

261
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,519
we were waiting

262
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,720
as Murphy's Law would have it uh there's

263
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,459
actually somebody

264
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,040
during the last three four months that

265
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,079
is working on in

266
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,079
um an open source implementation of the

267
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,740
ospf Yang model the the standard one not

268
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,720
the open Kit the standard one and so we

269
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,079
got a lot of late comments from him uh I

270
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,820
think once he he's not ready yet but

271
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,740
we're gonna ask him to come in and

272
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,339
present his uh open source this open

273
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,200
source code if we you know on the agenda

274
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,079
and a future IIT I think that'd be good

275
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,360
I can't remember his name right now it

276
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,300
was the guy from Brazil

277
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,279
Jeff has very quick comment just for the

278
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,040
notes so absolutely correct BFD did hold

279
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,200
things up because we found a bug what

280
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,519
was sort of the interesting bit of the

281
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,620
process is that we found out that for

282
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,660
effectively four lines of you know

283
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,820
fixing ITF it could be eight months to

284
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,519
get it through as a young module update

285
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,860
and you know as much as it was our fault

286
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,660
as you're saying you had all these last

287
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,459
minute things that Krypton after last

288
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,399
call during RFC process if every one of

289
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,200
those things you had ended up needing to

290
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
be individual update the eight month

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,860
timer would have basically restarted so

292
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,600
we need to find a way to sort of make

293
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,880
the entire process faster because if

294
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,740
you're an open config land you know the

295
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,959
old writing it's done yeah that's

296
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,760
exactly why I'm asking right is because

297
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,399
you know if we want to be the the

298
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,380
standard instead of open config we've

299
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,820
got to find a way to be able to publish

300
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,820
these faster exactly

301
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,279
well SPF based model from the first

302
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,100
version that zero zero version

303
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,399
individual draft to the end is published

304
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,300
at the rxc this took nine years

305
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,920
uh yeah I just want to say one more

306
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,959
thing about these two models the SR

307
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,220
models

308
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,740
uh once we publish these These are the

309
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,560
last working group documents from before

310
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,220
the merge of the ospf and Isis working

311
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,740
group so it'll be good to publish these

312
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,880
as well because then you'll be able to

313
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,940
do a search in the uh in the data

314
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,279
tracker for hyphen LSR hyphen and get

315
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,620
all the working group documents or all

316
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,240
the and and all the drafts that people

317
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,199
are purpose meaning

318
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,380
next slide please

319
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,279
um okay this one we also want to get a

320
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,820
published soon because this is the ospf3

321
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,579
extended RSA it also lays the foundation

322
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,220
of all of uh some of new feature

323
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,220
extensions based on ospf please read

324
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,199
send it out I say

325
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,180
so um

326
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,120
we need the working group chair to start

327
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,339
the young doctor request the real Doctor

328
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,519
review and joking directory review same

329
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,860
as the previous two

330
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,660
next slide please

331
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,360
okay um

332
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,279
ospf admin tax

333
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,220
um this is the experimental draft we are

334
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,579
doing uh not experimental comparative

335
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:27,959
standards

336
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,399
rxc ones but this is the one we try to

337
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,339
uh put the young model inside the draft

338
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,279
itself we choose this one because this

339
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,100
one is very um the exportable extensions

340
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,000
itself is very clear and straightforward

341
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,060
and we just thought we we may want to

342
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,500
try this

343
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,600
um but for some features that's more

344
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,560
complicated like a flexible or

345
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,600
application specific attribute that's

346
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,579
probably we want to keep the module

347
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:03,540
separate but this sort of extensions are

348
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,720
we think are the candidates we can try

349
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,839
yeah I'm a really big fan of this type

350
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,900
of thing I I think I was in I was kind

351
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,179
of in the rough though like and I

352
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,619
couldn't get everyone up to sign along

353
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,179
with it but

354
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,760
just my experience of even running them

355
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,160
in dual documents nobody actually pays

356
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,720
attention to the Yang document anyway

357
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,480
right like when I've run it and two two

358
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,040
you know they just follow the base

359
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,360
document

360
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,520
it doesn't I just don't think it holds

361
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,039
anything up to put it in there unless

362
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,780
you don't have the person who knows how

363
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,580
to do it that was the big complaint when

364
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,380
we brought this up the first time

365
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,179
was the person doing the protocol

366
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,679
extension work

367
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,720
didn't understand Yang well enough and

368
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,820
they didn't want to have to be required

369
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,799
to do the work to get their protocol

370
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,900
extension but yeah and the uh ospf and

371
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,200
Isis Yang models are quite involved

372
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,500
after a number of people you know if we

373
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,600
have like examples like this it'll make

374
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,240
it a lot easier yeah yeah to do whereas

375
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,640
but you know to get all those right X

376
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,380
paths right and everything and

377
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,660
constraints right agreed that that's a

378
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,559
good point

379
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,559
yeah so if you have a draft that's

380
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,900
um small protocol extensions you want to

381
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,900
uh have this sort of draft have the your

382
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,960
model put together and you don't want to

383
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,020
write the young module yourself and just

384
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,679
talk to us any of us will try to help

385
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,539
yeah definitely I think we could find

386
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,980
experts that could help you

387
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,840
so

388
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,860
um then we have the ospf module

389
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,080
augmentation for additional features

390
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,600
version one and we have the same thing

391
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,280
for ISS so these are the modules that

392
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,679
you make together with the draft so we

393
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,260
have them put all together

394
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,280
um so we just keep adding different new

395
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,940
features I think after the uh we

396
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,520
published the SR module and the extended

397
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,940
out RSA module then we Pro this will be

398
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,100
the next best suppose the ospf and the

399
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Isis so we will cut a stop there and

400
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,100
then start our version too so that this

401
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,679
is the list of features so far we

402
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,900
covered if you think we missed something

403
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,980
just let us know next

404
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,100
yeah this is the same thing for Isis

405
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,620
that's the list of features covered in

406
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,780
the Isis model

407
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,120
next slide please

408
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
and then we have the

409
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,179
um ospf and ISS Sr young module these

410
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,100
are just sitting in the back corner for

411
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,059
now

412
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:48,720
um

413
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,179
will be the

414
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,539
after the base draft uh published we'll

415
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,160
look at this one

416
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,900
next slide please

417
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,419
so just a summary you can see the

418
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,820
different colors and they miss different

419
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,500
uh probably go as patches

420
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,059
um how we want to progress them

421
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,140
question comment suggestions

422
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,419
yeah I I'd actually don't I don't know

423
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,880
does does the extension cover all the

424
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,160
published rfcs or do we still have more

425
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,400
to

426
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,340
yeah okay

427
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,160
for sure

428
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,400
you mean the augmentation

429
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,120
um at the time wage we went over the

430
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,760
list of all the Public's directors and

431
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,120
we think that we try to cover that high

432
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,000
some deployment with this gives some of

433
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,240
the not very popular yeah currencies

434
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,900
okay

435
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,580
here there's some extensions in here I

436
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,380
think they have their models in their

437
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,760
working place and they have augmented

438
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,960
ours

439
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,360
I would I need to check yeah I don't

440
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,320
think they I don't think they've

441
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,780
augmented the igps but I say yeah I know

442
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,299
they have the Oscars Standalone

443
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,520
Standalone beer model

444
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,520
okay yeah I'll take a look if they don't

445
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,100
have that then we can write one so

446
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,380
yeah I mean I because I I kind of think

447
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,200
I'd like to get a I know you guys like

448
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,380
the the chunking but it sure would be

449
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,720
nice to just get the people that are

450
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,240
proposing new things to do it you know

451
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,520
uh so that we don't have because like

452
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,260
you said the problem is you keep adding

453
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,179
things to it right and and as Jeff said

454
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,760
that resets the timer yeah so this was

455
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,659
like a

456
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,419
some of the RCs were published before we

457
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,460
started their work so it's sort of like

458
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,320
a catch up right exactly so this made

459
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,120
sense right but I'm saying like you said

460
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,440
you're going to start version two after

461
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,600
this and I'm like why can't we just I

462
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,039
really wish we could just publish them

463
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,659
along with the word just like I said

464
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,240
some future like admin text that's very

465
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,000
straightforward the draft itself is not

466
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,559
very um

467
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,840
very controversial our people have a lot

468
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,059
of discussions so the model is also

469
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,640
straightforward like flexible you

470
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,559
probably want to separate

471
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,200
uh instead of put them together and we

472
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,780
did I don't know that's just my thinking

473
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,240
I mean but the thing nobody's gonna

474
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,919
complain about the Yang model I guess

475
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,720
right they might complain about the

476
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,539
product but the you know the operational

477
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,280
State describing it I don't think it's

478
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,860
going to cause any it's just it's just a

479
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,780
I'm just trying to figure out a way to

480
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,120
get this stuff to go faster right yeah I

481
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,900
mean

482
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,720
also because the base model it published

483
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,100
now it's possible yeah otherwise

484
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,980
so we don't want to block the

485
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,140
publication of any draft because of a

486
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,260
young module is possible we also skipped

487
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,900
uh the experimentals especially the ones

488
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,120
that haven't taken off right

489
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,760
like there were three different monets

490
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,840
and I know one of them has very limited

491
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,419
deployment but the other two I don't I

492
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,000
don't believe they're deployed and so

493
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,220
actually those those would have added

494
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,080
significant augmentations would have

495
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,340
been a lot of work there were some other

496
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,320
experimental ones we skipped we didn't

497
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,299
do Isis ttz

498
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,700
anything experimental we skipped as well

499
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,320
thank you

500
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,960
yes yeah yeah it's okay

501
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,820
all right what's up next

502
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,178
thanks

503
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,100
uh yeah I believe that you're up in the

504
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,219
house

505
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,620
okay this is the ospf generalized

506
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,600
transport now the most work we did on

507
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,720
this was coming up with a new name

508
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,480
it used to be it used to be transport

509
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,740
instance but we decided that

510
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,760
it didn't really give it the gravitas

511
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,400
that it required so we came up with this

512
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,480
new name the ospf GT

513
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,120
Grand Touring no generalized transport

514
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,199
next slide

515
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,559
uh right uh

516
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,659
as you know we have we have a lot of

517
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,280
drafts I'm going to go into this that

518
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,679
use ospf to distribute information

519
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,980
so this is this is really using ospf is

520
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,159
very and and Isis as well this proved

521
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,620
very useful for disseminating

522
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,640
information throughout uh the igp

523
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,400
domains ospf domain and in Isis

524
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,980
they have a RFC I forget the number of

525
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,260
it called gen app where you can have a

526
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,380
another instance well for ospf ospf is

527
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,860
actually better suited for this

528
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,020
dissemination of information throughout

529
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,580
a domain then Isis because it runs on IP

530
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,980
later so

531
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,380
we were able to re because of that we

532
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,659
were able to remove all the restrictions

533
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:24,299
of generalized ospf because it does not

534
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:29,418
compute hop by hop routing excellent

535
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,039
now this is the biggest thing besides

536
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,380
besides having a separate instance in

537
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,919
which you're gonna uh you're gonna flood

538
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,120
non-routing information you can have uh

539
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,980
sparse topologies what I mean by a

540
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,279
sparse topology is that

541
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:53,159
the instance only talks to those uh ospf

542
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,159
routers that require the information

543
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,779
also

544
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,299
because because we're not Computing hop

545
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,000
by hop routing you still have a topology

546
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,919
but it's an over it can be an overlay

547
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,600
topology it doesn't have to be an

548
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,520
overlay topology but it can be an

549
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,500
overlay topology where you have remote

550
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,620
neighbors and you simply establish the

551
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,840
adjacency over the unicast topology

552
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,059
next next slide

553
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,700
here's just an example you see you have

554
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,640
the ospf routing domain there and you

555
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,039
can see that all the routers inside the

556
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,740
domain they don't they only do unicast

557
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,760
routing in the base instance zero and

558
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,279
you have routers on the edge that are

559
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,080
maybe doing some sort of services that

560
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,120
they need to have some information

561
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,860
disseminated to and they have multiple

562
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,659
instances so you establish the

563
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,840
adjacencies across the uh across the

564
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,480
domain and you just use normal ospf

565
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,520
flooding mechanisms to exchange the

566
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,539
information

567
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,460
one of the you know one of the main

568
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,480
things

569
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,840
reasons we don't like to use ospf and

570
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,919
Isis to disseminate information

571
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,960
is because a lot of times it's to maybe

572
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,059
one or two other routers in the whole

573
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:12,720
domain that are doing something and they

574
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,299
don't need it and everybody in the whole

575
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:16,919
domain gets it

576
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,640
next slide

577
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:23,340
well one another thing with this

578
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,159
now a lot of a lot of people have said

579
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,779
okay

580
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,779
you can put it in the base ospf instance

581
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,600
and you can still

582
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,760
prior prioritize

583
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,279
the unicast routing information or

584
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,020
whatever over any other information

585
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,299
you're distributed that's very hard to

586
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,140
do

587
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,779
I mean we already have all this stuff in

588
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,840
here where we where we uh throw away

589
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,720
hellos

590
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,980
packet processing we make sure that's

591
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,380
done because if you lose an adjacency it

592
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,440
starts on next we the next thing we

593
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,900
don't throw away is ax because if you

594
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,640
don't get the ACT through that's the

595
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,100
next priority you know SPF you don't use

596
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,620
put it on the re-transmission and queue

597
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,860
and it starts uh we haven't seen them as

598
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,960
much anymore I think Murphy's law has

599
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,440
helped us a lot but in the early 2000s

600
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,080
we had a lot of bigger networks that

601
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,960
were just getting into melting due to uh

602
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,960
topology changes and flooding

603
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,580
so

604
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,440
putting it in a separate instance

605
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,100
especially since most most uh platforms

606
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,440
are running and people are running you

607
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,779
know routing protocols on top of uh

608
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,900
Linux it's much easier to prioritize a

609
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,299
process to keep things separate

610
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:47,039
uh you can you can you can use uh what I

611
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,000
was going to say

612
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,720
uh ospf V3 supports the instance in the

613
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,120
packet directly we have an extension an

614
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,100
RFC for ospf I don't think it's been

615
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,159
implemented much but you you can do

616
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,460
instances in ospfp2 as well with uh

617
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,320
using a reserve field in the in the

618
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,299
packet

619
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:09,900
and like I said once for the packets you

620
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,260
can use different uh present IP

621
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,960
precedences or

622
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,240
I forget what it's called in ospf in

623
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,240
IPv6 but you could use the analogy to

624
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,539
IEP preference in OS in IPv6 to Pro

625
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:29,039
private prioritize the

626
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,880
um unicast packets over the uh I mean

627
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,100
the ospf packets for unicast apology

628
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,439
over the ones for uh transport instance

629
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,080
and here it just shows uh a new tlb

630
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,880
basically Isis had already gotten a

631
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,520
registry for Gen app for the different

632
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,380
applications so we'll use that same

633
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,580
registry to for any applications and

634
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,260
we're able to

635
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,220
um

636
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,960
for ospfp 2 we're going to put the

637
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,020
um have a new ospf

638
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,140
opaque LSA type with a new function code

639
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,080
for ospf V3 we'll just use the new OS LS

640
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,539
LSA type

641
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,260
next slide

642
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,179
and uh the first

643
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,539
the first we only have one

644
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:28,320
other new uh tlv in that that's a top

645
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,279
level tlv so we're figuring

646
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,860
uh with this will identify the

647
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,440
application type and then the the

648
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,039
applications will specify the encodings

649
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,100
underneath this top level tle

650
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,760
next slide

651
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,960
okay this is this is talking about

652
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,600
applications now we didn't attempt to

653
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,580
Define these the applications themselves

654
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,260
and any draft

655
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,539
let's say this this becomes assuming

656
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,760
this becomes a standard at some point

657
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,120
anything that uses it

658
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,919
would need to Define

659
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,840
the adherence to the condition of

660
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,360
reachability in other words over this

661
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,100
sparse topology

662
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,159
are you you'd normally only be able to

663
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:20,340
use information for from a router that

664
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,320
was reachable over the sparse topology

665
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,020
and whatever your internal apis you'd

666
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,840
let people you know you'd Rift broad now

667
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,820
you could relax that

668
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,340
for a given application so you'd use

669
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,279
information for some period of time and

670
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,340
sort of smooth things out even if the

671
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,418
connection went away

672
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,860
and here's just some all these are

673
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,240
controversial like I said these aren't

674
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,980
covered in the draft

675
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,559
there was a lot of discussion on IDR and

676
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,380
LSR about

677
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,399
uh the ongoing effort to keep bgpls in

678
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,460
line with uh

679
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,179
uh with with igps now what this would do

680
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:07,320
at least for ospf you could just

681
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,480
you could just put a wrap around this

682
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,940
and you could just transport the uh lsas

683
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,220
between routers over the sparse topology

684
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,760
without any re-encoding

685
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,600
and then do whatever you want with them

686
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,179
I mean uh

687
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,039
I know we got a lot invested a lot of

688
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,720
controllers I don't think this will

689
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,399
happen I think we'll just stay with BLS

690
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,320
and that's my that's my original that's

691
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,000
my thinking but this is one another

692
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,279
thing is now we're talking about putting

693
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,960
all these flow specs depending on how

694
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,820
much you can put those

695
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,240
into this management information and

696
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,179
there's a 5G application in the draft

697
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:51,140
okay next slide

698
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,000
yeah every I look we're not asking for

699
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,320
we're not going for working Google

700
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,299
asphal or anything but just asking for

701
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:01,279
comments and people die to read it

702
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,580
or not need to be further discussed uh

703
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,019
here is my my point I think

704
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:38,100
originally select or you select the ospf

705
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,720
as the delivery protocol you can provide

706
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,659
the reliable and variety mechanism but

707
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:48,000
for the non-looking information we don't

708
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,880
need the front end character we just

709
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,059
need the reliable character of the OTL

710
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,899
protocol so and based on this assumption

711
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:01,880
uh the reason that is you know there are

712
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,760
various

713
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,580
reliability reliable teleport protocol

714
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,000
in the current IIT iitfo um

715
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,060
standard so the reason that we still

716
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,260
select the oipf as the 24 portal I think

717
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,899
it is maybe the search information may

718
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,780
be related to the

719
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,060
routine information but but in your

720
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,020
draft you just

721
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:35,339
omit the interaction of the uh ospf for

722
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,760
root resistance and the application

723
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,199
instance I think this is the most

724
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,260
important important part if uh if you

725
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,560
consider consider the interaction of

726
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,800
these two different kind of variety of

727
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,300
instance I think the situation will be

728
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,540
complex and the there are another point

729
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,900
that you just

730
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,440
put the complex to the operator you know

731
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,940
for the different top

732
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,180
instance with the operating Master

733
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,700
deploy the different set of the labor

734
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,300
okay there are a lot of

735
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,339
redundant

736
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:19,079
configuration and management for the

737
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,020
overall network operations so I I

738
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,740
thought whether the support is the best

739
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,160
approach and we can we can see from the

740
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,280
history of the

741
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,980
another related draft let's see your

742
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,920
helmets and generally generally and

743
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,760
currently there are uh there are I think

744
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,220
there is no deployment for such solution

745
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,780
so I think this is the indication for

746
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,060
the similar similar approaches not maybe

747
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,560
not the best approach okay

748
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,680
yeah I definitely it definitely the

749
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,540
draft that's one thing I think we need I

750
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,800
need to add to the draft is the

751
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,260
manageability considerations and it

752
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,680
definitely will require

753
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,640
uh

754
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,579
you know uh more configuration than if

755
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:14,160
we just had a knob to stuff everything

756
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,700
into the base instance

757
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,099
but that could be you know that that

758
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,380
could be the Special Sauce vendor Supply

759
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,480
right exactly is that it's how well they

760
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,060
do it exactly exactly yeah uh you know

761
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,940
uh there are one of the your use case

762
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,780
either for the MP mec mec deployment for

763
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,880
MEC Department what do you want to

764
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,339
achieve is

765
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:40,140
the companies of the network information

766
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,320
and the server information so uh we

767
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,099
expected such information we did be

768
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:48,200
Transportation

769
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,020
unique instance not the different

770
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,220
instance okay

771
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,399
foreign

772
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,920
look at that application that

773
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,960
application let's say that I know there

774
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,800
was a lot of uh comments on on on using

775
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,359
that maybe that doesn't belong in the

776
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:10,500
transport in in the in ospf GT because

777
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,480
that would affect routing that is a

778
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,440
routing routing draft uh I'll take a

779
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,839
I'll take a look at that uh

780
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:21,540
exactly what we're talking about for the

781
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,140
5G

782
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:32,780
um okay all right

783
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,500
all right thanks AC

784
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,279
he's up next

785
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,220
eater

786
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,900
okay

787
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,119
um I'm Peter I'm going to present an

788
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,119
update on the prefix unreachable draft

789
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,640
or lift it up yeah

790
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,260
or you can be the rock star Mike it's

791
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,460
better

792
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,020
probably okay next slide please

793
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,400
all right so this has been presented at

794
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,920
the last ITF uh

795
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,480
I'm not going to

796
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,220
do the same presentation I'm just going

797
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,859
to do a quick update here so what is the

798
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,440
draft does it proposes uh Backward

799
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,859
Compatible mechanism to advertise a

800
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:31,500
unreachable prefixes

801
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,380
this is done for a certain purposes one

802
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,420
of them is the bgp big functionality in

803
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,940
the presence of the summarization

804
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,099
so there's no protocol extension here we

805
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,079
are using existing protocol mechanisms

806
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,700
to to achieve what we want to achieve

807
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,078
next slide please

808
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,119
so we updated the draft based on some of

809
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,820
the comments that we got uh we

810
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,400
explicitly specify in the draft which

811
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,260
Isis tlvs are supposed to use the UPA

812
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,960
we did the same for SPF V2 and V3 we

813
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,780
specify the lsas and tlvs where you pay

814
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,520
is applicable

815
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,400
we got a comment saying that what we do

816
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,339
when we propagate the UPI is not what

817
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:16,800
the base specification of the protocol

818
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,079
do so we put some text in the draft

819
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,760
describing that you cannot use the

820
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,540
reachability for propagation which is

821
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,220
what is being done in the protocols for

822
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,859
the regular reachable prefixes it's

823
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,859
contrary you you you must not use the

824
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:36,720
reachability you basically propagate

825
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,460
unreachable and you don't have the

826
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,920
prefix reachable so that is a deviation

827
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,740
from the basic specification

828
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,200
you also put a we got a comment from

829
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,500
Bruno I believe that we wanted a text

830
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,680
that the processing of the UPS on the

831
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,420
edge devices should be optional and

832
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,300
configured by the CLI so we put that

833
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,800
text in the draft

834
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,880
next slide please

835
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,119
so uh in terms of the intended status

836
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,339
the draft is published as it is as an

837
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,660
informational

838
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,240
uh some people feel that because of the

839
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,700
propagation specification we have some

840
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,440
normative language there we should

841
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,140
change this into the standard track

842
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,480
I leave that up to the working group to

843
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,599
decide and find both ways but probably

844
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,119
would make a sense to make it a standard

845
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,859
track because of that change

846
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,560
next slide please

847
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,480
yeah and the biggest discussion that has

848
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,240
been going on on the list is uh you know

849
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,940
either using the unreachable metric that

850
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,560
is already defined in the protocols

851
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,540
versus having an explicit signaling for

852
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,000
unreachability so some people feel we

853
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,520
should have an explicit mechanism

854
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,619
well the problem with that is that it

855
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,619
would make the uh the change known by

856
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,900
quad compatible so to deploy this you

857
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,700
would need to update every single router

858
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,800
in the network otherwise the routers

859
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,440
would keep thinking that this prefix is

860
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,640
actually reachable

861
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,339
so that would significantly complicate

862
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:08,040
the deployment of this extension

863
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,460
I personally don't see any advantage of

864
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,020
doing so given that we have the

865
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,119
mechanics in the protocols already but

866
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,560
obviously this discussion might continue

867
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,780
and I can see you

868
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,859
it is going to continue

869
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,160
and next slide please

870
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,960
so uh

871
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,000
we are welcoming any comments on

872
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,339
discussion on the working group

873
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:33,839
it looks like there is sufficient

874
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,400
interest in this there is an

875
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,920
implementation at least one I know the

876
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,359
second one is

877
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,260
being done or will be done soon

878
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,820
I would like to ask for the adoption of

879
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,460
this draft and no I think there's enough

880
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,180
enough interest in solving this problem

881
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,359
um uh is the implementation the same

882
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,180
vendor or do you have a multi-vendor

883
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,460
no so so far it's it's I only know about

884
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,619
the single implantation yeah you said

885
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,599
the new one though there will be one

886
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,460
which is coming is that so that's a

887
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,599
different one oh that's great yeah

888
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,119
uh okay we have people in the queue now

889
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,040
so yeah eigen

890
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,859
foreign

891
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,829
[Music]

892
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,660
Curry's detail perfect so uh this is I

893
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,800
think this is the right use usage of the

894
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,280
ls infinity and the second point is

895
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,119
there are several other

896
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:36,359
usage for this value so we I think we

897
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:39,060
cannot we need not a complex the

898
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,540
situation by uh we use or they Define

899
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:47,160
the ls Infinity media for for the uh

900
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,740
pretty unreachable usage and

901
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:58,160
I think Peter Hill mentioned the foreign

902
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,380
expression there are I think the

903
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,079
situation will be more complex you know

904
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,740
it will bring more limitation for the

905
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,440
deployment of the such solution you know

906
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,680
I think from one from one from the

907
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,579
implementation of device the easy to

908
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:25,920
implement implemented but for the

909
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,619
deployment of the overall source of

910
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:33,240
operator I think it is complex so we

911
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,819
think we should simplify the situation

912
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:41,420
and need the explicit indication for the

913
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,880
perfect unreachability okay

914
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,280
right so let me try to answer your

915
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,280
comments so the definition of you are

916
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,960
talking mostly about the OSP adults

917
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,180
Infinity I guess that's clear it's

918
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,619
obvious that it means unreachability

919
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,060
whether you like it or not it is

920
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,579
unreachable and we can use it in terms

921
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:02,160
of using this metric for other purposes

922
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,619
you're probably referring to IPR flex

923
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,060
algor and things like that we have

924
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,900
defined explicitly that these metrics

925
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,000
are Infinity metrics in that context as

926
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,920
well so honestly I don't see any

927
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,260
complexity but you know we can argue

928
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,319
forever we tried on the list I let other

929
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:20,819
people in the working group to speak up

930
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,700
yeah I I agree you guys have been going

931
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,980
back and forth and we should get other

932
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,359
people's opinions and then we're going

933
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,680
to have to make a call right

934
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,060
uh we have to let AC John

935
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,619
ketan and WeMo go before you Tony

936
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,980
yeah okay good okay uh speaking as

937
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,160
working group uh member the first thing

938
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,720
I gotta say I think it needs to be

939
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,180
standards track because the avrs need to

940
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,520
have a different behavior of propagating

941
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,260
it I think you mentioned that I don't

942
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,599
know I don't know for everybody and I I

943
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,880
really think this is this is the best

944
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,980
from Backward Compatible

945
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,319
uh standpoint I don't think that's

946
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,920
picking your voice

947
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:10,380
yeah okay

948
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,780
hopefully they can hear me on the other

949
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,300
yeah over there over the internet right

950
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,380
okay

951
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,060
so

952
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,660
also uh speaking as a working group

953
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,700
member if you know there's

954
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,000
implementations I think the other the

955
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,280
the one thing that I didn't

956
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,160
get way back about a year ago we started

957
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,440
talking about this was this is a

958
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,220
temporary if like an ephemeral

959
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,560
uh notification in this at least this

960
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,619
draft it's meant to go to

961
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:46,260
routers that are going to redo the

962
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,440
recursive resolution so it's it's also

963
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,920
also from uh deployment standpoint it's

964
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,359
not

965
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,640
it's actually better from a deployment

966
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,040
standpoint manability standpoint because

967
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,720
you only

968
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,660
have the routers that need to do it

969
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,079
acting on it that's the comment that we

970
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,720
got and included from Bruno

971
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,540
okay John you're up

972
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,619
okay

973
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:17,940
um just speaking as a contributor here

974
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,819
uh and it just occurred to me because AC

975
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:23,520
presented like just before you or you

976
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,619
know a couple before you is like uh

977
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,839
isn't this potentially an application

978
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,380
for the Gran Turismo version of ospf

979
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,359
that AC just presented because there's

980
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,220
like a whole bunch of routers in the you

981
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,359
know that just don't need to know about

982
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:39,359
this stuff thank you I mean it's a fair

983
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,460
comment but this is directly related to

984
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,300
the routing this is I look at it as a

985
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,760
routing information and it is basically

986
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,740
related to what we advertise as a

987
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,660
routing so putting this into a different

988
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,640
instance would be a bit

989
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,400
you know I see I would say yeah that

990
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,500
sort of came up at the end of but you're

991
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,880
writing terms of that not everybody

992
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,500
needs this so we flooded uh because this

993
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,240
is just slide as a standard prefix

994
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,420
reachability with a specific metric uh

995
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,240
the processing is up to the receiver but

996
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,319
it acts on it or not

997
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,099
uh

998
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,819
hello this is

999
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:26,819
and I have two comments now first is the

1000
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:31,920
uh if we use our cemented so we just we

1001
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,220
also need to consider the

1002
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:39,720
conversion because in the network we

1003
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,440
deployed some nodes yeah but they didn't

1004
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,220
think the they didn't know uh the new

1005
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,200
behavior of the

1006
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,319
of what you want to to do and like when

1007
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,000
like the I was imprinted Now new

1008
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,040
the act on the yeah

1009
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,079
but the new Behavior Maybe in the future

1010
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,500
not not to ah no no okay okay so are you

1011
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,480
asking we want to use the ls Infinity

1012
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,980
for some other purposes um

1013
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,180
it's unreachable we can't use it for

1014
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,619
anything else we can use it for

1015
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,619
unreachability

1016
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:20,480
anesthetical device

1017
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,060
magical yeah mathematical come on now

1018
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,599
yeah yeah

1019
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,900
they see them but for the new term for

1020
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,480
the auditor this is a command when we

1021
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,980
use this command that we we that has uh

1022
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,700
metric root I'll say and the the only

1023
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:47,220
use is to define the untributed but in

1024
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,980
your structure you know document as a

1025
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,160
behavior is to Define maybe you have

1026
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,480
some new Behavior I think so even in

1027
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,720
this situation I think the old device

1028
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,079
can't do that so so if you are referring

1029
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:08,460
to the

1030
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,200
you know the interaction between the

1031
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,540
maximatic and this one they basically do

1032
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,640
the same thing if you do an X metric

1033
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,380
what you do for prefix is that by

1034
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,700
reachable that you advertise you

1035
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,500
advertise it with a Max Matrix so we are

1036
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,940
making something reachable and reachable

1037
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,740
what we do here is that we are

1038
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,180
advertising and reachable for something

1039
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,520
which never was reachable because it's

1040
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,319
part of the summary but at the end of

1041
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,000
the day what you want at the edge device

1042
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,500
is to act on the loss of the

1043
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,780
reachability so I don't see a conflict

1044
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,300
but I think we can talk about it okay

1045
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,660
maybe sure

1046
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,839
can

1047
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,140
now look at Cisco so this is mainly

1048
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,260
about the ls Infinity use uh I just want

1049
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,900
to a code that this has been there in

1050
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,319
the protocols since decades uh there is

1051
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,359
nothing changed there uh from its

1052
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,940
meaning or semantics purposes uh

1053
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,460
probably what's added is really the

1054
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,920
processing at the receiver uh to treat

1055
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,960
it as uh you know an indication

1056
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,260
so I really don't understand or follow

1057
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:19,220
uh the debate about the ls Infinity part

1058
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,899
thanks WeMo

1059
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,079
interesting

1060
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,380
I think this is a Hot Topic because we

1061
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,599
had quite a few jobs working on this one

1062
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,500
right

1063
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,720
so this one looks like a

1064
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,140
for the infinity Matrix uh looks like uh

1065
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,960
is for unreachable right also is used

1066
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,700
for aging out

1067
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,520
for some other day which to message that

1068
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,520
will be also consider this one either

1069
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,980
one parameter for each out right

1070
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,140
oh aging out is done differently it's

1071
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,980
not also this is the Matrix so if some

1072
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,079
link metric or whatever metric is close

1073
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,040
to this value all

1074
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,079
is considered also on uh infinity

1075
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:08,700
unreachable

1076
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,119
some big metric I mean yeah

1077
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:14,640
so I'm not sure I understand so you're

1078
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,460
saying uh how do we distinguish this

1079
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,760
between the the Aging out of the LSA no

1080
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,540
no so in the AG house I think in the RFP

1081
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,819
what if she says that you can use max

1082
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:29,220
metric or LS Infinity as an alternative

1083
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,720
for max age but the metric itself

1084
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,700
doesn't age out the LSA yeah I know I

1085
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,800
know that's a considered one parameter

1086
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,460
for each out in RC if we check that one

1087
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,740
another thing is for the ninja Matrix

1088
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,160
for magic is close to Infinity of the

1089
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,619
handle this case

1090
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:52,260
is reachable but the metric is very big

1091
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,300
is close to Infinity

1092
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,940
so you consider is also unreachable or

1093
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,920
reachable well you can't do it right

1094
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,079
because the spec says any metric is a

1095
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:03,240
valid metric and LS Infinity has a

1096
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,380
special meaning

1097
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,420
I don't think we want to define a new

1098
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,440
value

1099
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,599
of a metric for this

1100
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,339
so I'm going to consider those are

1101
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:13,859
different uh Solutions

1102
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:16,680
so this one you claim is the back order

1103
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,180
compatible I think the other solution

1104
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,859
can also make a

1105
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:21,599
pack of convertible but I don't know if

1106
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,380
there's a different number

1107
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,740
uh thanks female uh Tony you're up yeah

1108
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,200
you've got proxy in the queue Tony P

1109
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,319
Juniper jumping into the slot

1110
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,359
um so as metaphorane we shouldn't forget

1111
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:39,420
that this is inflected Upon Us by

1112
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,880
technologies that were you know

1113
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,220
fashionable but forgot that oam is part

1114
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,700
of a you know decently run network and

1115
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,440
we're solving it in

1116
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,319
arguably the wrong protocol

1117
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,200
of all the bad ideas to go about this

1118
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,180
thing this is by far the best one right

1119
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,119
so it has a validity okay

1120
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:03,119
what my comment is I would not put it on

1121
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,780
the standards track uh because this does

1122
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,059
fundamentally doesn't scale we all know

1123
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:12,000
that right use that stuff as

1124
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,180
and in the right amount as a spice can

1125
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,700
stop the intention problem with the

1126
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,260
technology without you know running a

1127
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,700
lot of machinery

1128
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,460
we put it on the standards track uh

1129
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,020
everybody

1130
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,880
and our customers and their dogs will

1131
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,500
demand for the staff to be implemented

1132
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,119
and they will feel that this thing is

1133
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:31,319
something they should be rolling and

1134
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:32,760
before we know we have to stop the large

1135
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,099
scale and deployment so I would keep it

1136
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,980
on informational

1137
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,540
as something you know that you have in

1138
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,059
your toolbox a toolbox and you pull out

1139
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:43,920
and if you use it correctly it's not a

1140
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,720
bad mechanism I would not signal that I

1141
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,520
think it's completely Superfluous I mean

1142
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,839
the beauty of this thing is that you

1143
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:50,099
actually without signaling into your

1144
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:51,720
work you can mix it and it will work

1145
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,280
fine

1146
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,140
if we really really push for the

1147
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,960
standards track uh I think the

1148
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,300
operational concern is something that

1149
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,920
will be steering straight into your face

1150
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,780
like a really big operational section

1151
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,640
saying like you're peeling off stickers

1152
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,059
and you'll get hurt most likely uh or

1153
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:10,500
maybe a separate operational document

1154
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,900
but this will get lost right so

1155
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,720
that's kind of my meta comment but still

1156
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,099
from all the stuff

1157
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:20,099
sloshing around by far the best thing if

1158
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:23,520
you want to solve in the protocol and um

1159
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,800
no signaling I mean that will just ramp

1160
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,339
up complexity to the max yeah so I agree

1161
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:32,640
with everything you said even with the

1162
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,980
the best of the bad things but you know

1163
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,200
we have to solve the problem in in a

1164
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,720
certain way so in terms of the standard

1165
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,819
track I wish we can keep it

1166
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:43,440
informational the only thing is that we

1167
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,359
are changing the ABR behavior in terms

1168
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:46,859
of propagation there is a normative

1169
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:49,200
language there I don't know if we can do

1170
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,760
that in the information if you can I'm

1171
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,280
not for it we do have a lot of swap in

1172
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,960
our in our agenda but we're gonna have

1173
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,720
to this is very subtle we do not change

1174
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,380
APR behavior and I explain why

1175
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,200
because the only thing we mandate is the

1176
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,660
behavior of Notes on The Wire

1177
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,000
that's it the whole idea of

1178
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,040
interoperability means that we Define

1179
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,619
the observable behavior on the wire as

1180
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:15,839
long as you comply you comply to the

1181
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,700
specs everything else is kind of

1182
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,619
obviously works for me right for me

1183
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:21,300
because we say about like how you

1184
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,059
compute okay SPF computations like where

1185
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:26,160
it starts to get delicate but all the

1186
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,260
redistributors and summarization and so

1187
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,300
on right we've write documents about to

1188
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,119
tell people how to implement it but we

1189
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,760
really over specifying as long as this

1190
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,380
thing does on The Wire something that

1191
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,660
complies the protocol specs format you

1192
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,000
are conforming look I leave that to the

1193
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,619
working group to decide there is some

1194
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,540
language in the existing specs about

1195
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,180
when you propagate prefixes between the

1196
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,400
levels or areas and that that talks

1197
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,200
about reachability

1198
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,880
um look I I really would like to keep

1199
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,920
this informational to be honest this is

1200
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,960
the only thing if we can do this with

1201
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,059
information track I'm all for it I'm

1202
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:01,800
busy on this okay I think we're invite

1203
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,780
an agreement yeah we could go

1204
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,079
experimental too I mean I I do think

1205
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:08,880
speaking as working groups here we could

1206
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,559
make we could make an experimental

1207
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,119
because as well

1208
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:17,040
and and because we do specify the the

1209
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,160
pro the ABR behavior in both Isis and

1210
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,520
ospf I'm diagnostic right I just know

1211
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,319
what happens when one system moves on

1212
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,720
the standards how the rfps start to fill

1213
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,940
in with this stuff right okay thanks

1214
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,579
thanks Tony uh I do you're up next but

1215
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:34,319
can you please go quick we've got two

1216
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,240
other people before we got to cut the

1217
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,540
cue

1218
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:50,119
specific prefix but not a

1219
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:53,460
deliver the unreachable information how

1220
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,940
to how to use to and how do you how do

1221
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:02,160
you differentiate the the UI newly

1222
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,040
defined unreachability Behavior okay

1223
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,040
sorry I I don't understand

1224
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,480
uh so I uh

1225
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,240
no are you talking about the metrics

1226
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,059
still yeah I think the there are there

1227
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:21,000
uh there are already the usage of the

1228
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,780
lse infinity Network or in the in future

1229
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:29,059
so uh if you define a tool or more

1230
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:33,599
meaning for for them for it I think uh

1231
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,720
zero definitely will be

1232
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,260
um exist to the uh all ops obscure

1233
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,680
scenario as the receiver cannot judge if

1234
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,839
it is okay so what I would propose maybe

1235
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,059
if you have any particular scenarios in

1236
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:51,200
your mind just please listen

1237
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,760
thank you and we can go over it all

1238
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,020
right you're up

1239
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:02,059
um

1240
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:05,460
can you hear me

1241
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,960
yes we can

1242
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,799
uh okay so uh when when we summarize a

1243
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,680
prefix it loses a bunch of information

1244
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,319
right details

1245
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,819
so one is the untreachability

1246
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:20,520
information uh similarly you also lose

1247
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,380
the metric information

1248
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:26,040
so one of the uh very common techniques

1249
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,980
that is used to drain the traffic from

1250
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:33,599
nodes is to set the node to overload

1251
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,140
uh and then advertise High metric uh

1252
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,260
which which uh

1253
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,540
informs the other PE that to remove that

1254
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,140
node and choose another PE to uh send

1255
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,359
the traffic so this functionality is

1256
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:50,400
also lost when you summarize because you

1257
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,440
can no longer send the metric for this

1258
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,000
particular higher metric for this

1259
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,380
particular PE

1260
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,359
C so what I'm going to say is there are

1261
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,240
more use cases which arise out of the

1262
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,660
summarization that today or in future

1263
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,000
will need to be solved and and we also

1264
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,619
need to look at how we are going to

1265
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:09,900
solve those when you know so have a

1266
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,119
single mechanism to solve all these kind

1267
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:15,000
of use cases instead of looking at them

1268
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,660
one by one

1269
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,440
uh that's a very comment uh if do you

1270
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,200
see why we can't use this mechanism for

1271
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,759
the use case that you just mentioned

1272
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,559
oh yeah so there is a difference right a

1273
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:33,299
planned maintenance is different from

1274
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:35,700
you know unreachability if you are if

1275
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,500
the node really goes down you probably

1276
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,900
want to trigger bgp pick

1277
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,059
but if it's a planned maintenance all

1278
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:44,460
you want to do is uh in your bgp best

1279
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,520
part selection uh you just want to cost

1280
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,520
out this particular PE right so there is

1281
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,460
a difference it's not the same

1282
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,799
hmm

1283
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:58,140
okay well

1284
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,200
if you have a any idea I'm I'm All For

1285
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,099
You

1286
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:05,220
that's a generic solution I we are here

1287
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,020
we are really trying to fix a particular

1288
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,640
use case you're right

1289
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,819
uh if you have a like something more

1290
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:15,558
generic that we can use I'm all for it

1291
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,720
uh yeah and that was Tony Tony P's Point

1292
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,579
as well right it's like it'd be nice if

1293
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:22,500
we could solve this kind of the right

1294
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,400
way right instead of just well anyway

1295
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,380
what is the right way yeah many other

1296
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,520
ways

1297
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,640
all right thank you David you're up and

1298
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,680
Dan I'm sorry but I forgot to lock the

1299
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,720
queue uh David's going to be the last

1300
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,540
comment uh that was on Partner

1301
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,760
um it's a pretty Minor Detail but the

1302
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,880
behavior for the very high metrics is

1303
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,940
not quite the same in Isis and ospf and

1304
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,319
I think the draft is accidentally

1305
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:51,599
changing existing behavior for Isis for

1306
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,099
those High metrics

1307
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:54,900
um I think it might be better to no

1308
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,079
really no no if you go over the draft

1309
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,180
there are sections from the Bose uh

1310
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,579
spherical specification

1311
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:04,619
okay great you are talking about the

1312
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:06,960
link Matrix that's right but prefix

1313
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,059
Matrix the unreachability is defined in

1314
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,900
both protocols

1315
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:15,980
thank you everybody

1316
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,260
next up

1317
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,940
yes it's still you

1318
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,160
we just read I we do have a little bit

1319
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,260
of slop in our in our time but we were

1320
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,859
starting to go on Beyond even the swap

1321
01:02:28,859 --> 01:02:31,079
so it's okay you can take your time you

1322
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:32,579
can take this a lot of time all right so

1323
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:34,859
this is just a very quick uh update on

1324
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:36,540
the reverse affinity

1325
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,660
on behalf of the quarters so it's the

1326
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,859
next slide

1327
01:02:40,859 --> 01:02:44,280
so this has been presented in the

1328
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,720
interim

1329
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,500
uh I guess during that time the uh I

1330
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,359
actually got the feeling that

1331
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,980
people kind of acknowledge that it's

1332
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,079
really the useful use case that we are

1333
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:56,520
trying to solve

1334
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,540
it's a very simple extension adding the

1335
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:02,579
exclude include and include all Rivers

1336
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:06,359
Affinity sub tlb to the fat and then

1337
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:08,280
accordingly the rules in the in the

1338
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,900
calculation where we are basically doing

1339
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,819
exactly the same thing as we do with the

1340
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:13,380
regular affinities in the forwarding

1341
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,000
Direction

1342
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,920
next slide

1343
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,420
so

1344
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,059
I haven't received any other comments or

1345
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:22,559
we haven't received any other comments

1346
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,619
on the list they're always welcome for

1347
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:27,240
me this is a very straightforward

1348
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,640
extension and we can just adopt it and

1349
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,680
work on it I really don't see why we

1350
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,000
need to wait there is actually an

1351
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,619
implementation on it just do it

1352
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,400
that's all so I save some time yeah

1353
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,200
yeah maybe I was overly worried all

1354
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,579
right um

1355
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:49,020
thanks Peter it doesn't look like

1356
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:52,020
anybody's getting in the queue so uh

1357
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,839
yeah please please read the document and

1358
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:55,680
um

1359
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,540
I guess we'll have to decide if we do an

1360
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,339
adoption call or not

1361
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:01,339
right

1362
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:06,078
three before

1363
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:11,839
yeah yeah

1364
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,480
speaking is working group chair we have

1365
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,359
some I know we have some Doc uh I know a

1366
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,579
lot of you were in the interim that we

1367
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:26,819
had between IET F1 14 and 115 we have

1368
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:30,599
some uh adoption calls from that

1369
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:33,420
oh boy from those drafts as well so we

1370
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,940
got some adoption calls called up I mean

1371
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,540
Cudo

1372
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,579
um Okay can everyone hear me

1373
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:51,180
yes uh yes from robot okay hello

1374
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,760
everyone my name is Julia from Huawei

1375
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,180
and my topic will be Loop detection for

1376
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,140
imported roots

1377
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:03,299
uh next please uh

1378
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,400
um this is a syllabus for today's

1379
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:10,040
presentation okay next test slide

1380
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:14,000
um next place

1381
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,280
um as Dynamic routing particles highs as

1382
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,339
an ospf are widely used on live networks

1383
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:23,700
motor route import between igp instance

1384
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,520
is often involved in networking

1385
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,059
Solutions however

1386
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,520
restrict auditing policy and always

1387
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,000
needed it for this scenario for example

1388
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,579
the figure show in the in the slide when

1389
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:44,099
military root import happens among more

1390
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:47,460
than two ADP instance shown in as the

1391
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:48,740
picture

1392
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:53,099
there will be multiple routers

1393
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:56,880
uh as router C and router G they will

1394
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,760
import the same

1395
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,980
prefix

1396
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:04,260
1.1.1 for example from two different igp

1397
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,200
instance which is easy one and it is

1398
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,700
three

1399
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,119
um they both import the prefix to the to

1400
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:14,960
the ass to precise

1401
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,780
both these two prefix are advertised by

1402
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:23,119
root C energy as an external prefix

1403
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,480
their shame the same priority and in

1404
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,640
this scenario

1405
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,880
what we need to do is configured

1406
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,420
um

1407
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,520
write routine policy in this abrs

1408
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,500
otherwise you know human almost make

1409
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,740
this when the routing policy configured

1410
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:44,520
wrong

1411
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,339
the routing Loop may occur and the cost

1412
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:52,740
critical network problems so we make

1413
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:56,039
this draft to learn away help LGB

1414
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:00,660
interns to find out whether a prefix it

1415
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,700
will import from other instances is

1416
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,640
already being

1417
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,059
advertised or redistributed by itself

1418
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:10,250
another slight place

1419
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:13,140
[Music]

1420
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:13,859
um

1421
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:16,619
if the ADP instance could recognize the

1422
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:19,380
route has already been redistributed by

1423
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:22,740
itself when it tried to import a route

1424
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:25,319
from others the root will knows that

1425
01:07:25,319 --> 01:07:28,099
there might be routine Loops because you

1426
01:07:28,099 --> 01:07:33,240
consider instance report prefix again

1427
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,599
and therefore we propose a new

1428
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:37,760
sub-service

1429
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,180
in the draft to support a advertised IP

1430
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,720
version 4 and I believe 6 prefix extend

1431
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,720
attribute flags and a list of source

1432
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,740
root ID of the routers which has

1433
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:57,020
redistributed the prefix net slide

1434
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,559
foreign

1435
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:03,920
as the slide

1436
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,280
we named this sub Theory as prefix

1437
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,920
redistribute list sub Theory and it will

1438
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,579
be advertised as an optional sub Poe of

1439
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:15,679
towers

1440
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:21,000
135 to 35 to 36 and 237

1441
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,660
um in is ISS LSP

1442
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:28,620
um shown us the show and the trophy

1443
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,050
feature

1444
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,560
[Music]

1445
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,000
the prefix the type value of this sub

1446
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,399
tailway will be 10 and the length of the

1447
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,279
type field and lens field are both one

1448
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:44,520
batch the value field start with one bad

1449
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,179
prefix is turned attribute Flags the

1450
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:51,719
first bit of the flags is as flag and

1451
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:54,319
the second bit of the flag is our flag

1452
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,238
all other bits are reserved for future

1453
01:08:57,238 --> 01:08:58,679
use

1454
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:01,580
um that means plan how the flag is

1455
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:04,979
for a given sub theory in one eyes as

1456
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:09,238
LSP when the S black is set the prefix

1457
01:09:09,238 --> 01:09:11,880
has been redistributed by the router

1458
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,040
which generated the LSP that's the

1459
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,339
meaning when the r flag is said the

1460
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:19,799
prefix has been redistributed by other

1461
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:22,198
routers other than the router which

1462
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:25,819
generates the LSP and after one bad flag

1463
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:29,759
a list of root ID will be presented each

1464
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,000
other ID will be 6 by

1465
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,660
ISS system ID and all the router ID in

1466
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,238
the list represents a router which has

1467
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:43,818
imported and re-advertised the prefix

1468
01:09:44,339 --> 01:09:47,100
and that's all the content about the

1469
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:51,060
subtory and just before the as a session

1470
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:54,920
we receive some comments

1471
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:59,280
they ask for the difference between the

1472
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:05,219
draft and the RFC 7794

1473
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:10,860
we make some explain and and we will

1474
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,440
address it here we received some

1475
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,980
comments say that uh root important not

1476
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,520
only between Isis instance but also

1477
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,219
between ISS and ospf

1478
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:27,179
so the root ID here we defined as is

1479
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:32,340
system ID for six Beds which may not be

1480
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:35,340
perfect

1481
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:39,000
it may be changed for further extensions

1482
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,280
to uh

1483
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:47,400
to be more extendable it can be any uh

1484
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,920
it can be the root ID from any protocol

1485
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:55,260
to to solve much more scenario problems

1486
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,040
uh

1487
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:02,880
Nest a Nestor slide please and also we

1488
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:08,480
denote Aid ospf session in the draft

1489
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,120
so the further plan will be the ospf

1490
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,699
prefix redistribute list of till we we

1491
01:11:14,699 --> 01:11:15,980
will

1492
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:19,040
still need to be discussed

1493
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,719
how the tlb we will be work

1494
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:29,100
so that's all for for my sharing thank

1495
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,280
you

1496
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,460
any questions Tony yeah Tony p is up

1497
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,860
um Tony PG repair uh Zach can make it

1498
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,100
one sentence uh we should very most

1499
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,820
definitely not do it uh and if you want

1500
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,860
two more minutes then I can give some

1501
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:49,080
clue dispensing otherwise it's you know

1502
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,000
the comments like kill it as quick as

1503
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,560
possible

1504
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,440
yeah uh that was also expressed by Less

1505
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,099
on the list

1506
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:02,820
yeah if we do have we do have two

1507
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,400
minutes to just dispense

1508
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,860
so uh

1509
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,199
it's just exceedingly bad Network design

1510
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:14,699
in 99.9 of the cases so if you need

1511
01:12:14,699 --> 01:12:16,739
those prefixes to be around you'll build

1512
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:19,860
a hierarchical igp and if you run out of

1513
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,620
hierarchical igp then

1514
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:25,320
in 99.9 of the cases you should go and

1515
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,440
segment it via bgp okay

1516
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,020
yes you should

1517
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,020
um

1518
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,100
well otherwise you start to build a

1519
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,600
distance Vector protocol on top of this

1520
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,580
whole thing

1521
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,699
you know I develop if IDR lets us do

1522
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:43,739
that and then we start to invent you

1523
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,540
know the attributes on the whole thing

1524
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:49,020
and we basically start to carry it all

1525
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:52,739
this Vector protocols around

1526
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:55,679
um and the case

1527
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,980
there are only two no this is really

1528
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,420
just one case when you run out of

1529
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:04,080
hierarchy which happens in 0.01 even if

1530
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,360
percent of the cases

1531
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,800
okay

1532
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,840
so and and isn't it am I wrong in saying

1533
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,320
that in that point zero one case you

1534
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,940
also have to configure your routers

1535
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,140
wrong

1536
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,920
right so this is this is just protecting

1537
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,100
operators from misconfiguring in 0.001

1538
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,739
if you have a customer that ends up in

1539
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:29,760
this case

1540
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,159
he better be extremely clueful and then

1541
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,960
like managing those policies the least

1542
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,580
of your problems

1543
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:39,239
so uh we are piling an enormous amount

1544
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:41,640
of complexity into the protocol

1545
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,699
okay which will have a very hard time to

1546
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:46,440
standardize and it will be almost

1547
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,060
impossible to deploy

1548
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,920
right because there's no way any of the

1549
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,540
stuff will be backwards compatible with

1550
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,080
all the routers and buggy versions will

1551
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,840
lead us down the bgp path right 20 years

1552
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,480
of trying to you know maneuver the whole

1553
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,199
distance Vector uh or actually you know

1554
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:06,480
will drag the attributes around with us

1555
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,300
on top very quickly okay all right

1556
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,940
thanks Tony AC you're up next uh

1557
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:14,280
speaking as working group member this um

1558
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,380
I agree with everything Tony said and I

1559
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,300
just wanted to say that

1560
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,340
you know this is this the way the

1561
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,320
giraffe is written it doesn't you know

1562
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,120
routers don't work that way you

1563
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,159
distribute routes through

1564
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,980
the Rev and only the active routes get

1565
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,840
leaked between protocols you don't have

1566
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,360
any direct instance to instance product

1567
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,000
that would be broken to do that

1568
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,360
right now I have I have had networks not

1569
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,000
with one end not with three instances in

1570
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,640
a row but with two instances when we've

1571
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,760
had uh ospf networks due to acquisition

1572
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,020
or combined and at the boundaries there

1573
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,480
is already a tag it's in all the Yang

1574
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,400
model I don't think it's it was it was

1575
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,000
it's mainly a bgp uh I guess it is in

1576
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,560
the protocols as well it's in all the

1577
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,060
protocols there's already a tag that's

1578
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,400
advertised and what you do is you use

1579
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,380
that tag to keep uh to keep the mutual

1580
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,420
redistribution working

1581
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,640
from from redistributing routes that

1582
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,040
have come from uh one instance into

1583
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,320
another that's commonly known it works

1584
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,420
not only between protocols it works

1585
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,340
between I mean between Protocols of the

1586
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,340
same the same type it works between all

1587
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,100
types of uh

1588
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,679
protocols and static routes or whatever

1589
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:34,080
that are

1590
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,659
our average re-advertised in igp so I

1591
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:38,219
would say kill this as soon as possible

1592
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:40,260
and certainly don't waste time on the

1593
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:43,800
ospf extensions

1594
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:47,760
right but

1595
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,360
um we try to solve is when routine Loop

1596
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,699
happens

1597
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:56,760
we can use this up to your way to detect

1598
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:00,239
the loop and take some actions to solve

1599
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:04,320
um of course we have a road policy but

1600
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,199
about a window Road policy config

1601
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:10,560
not correctly it still will

1602
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,659
be routine Loops in the network

1603
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,120
okay thank you Peter you're up now

1604
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:25,199
so I'm just going to probably repeat

1605
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,360
redistribution happens Tony I wish it

1606
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,640
doesn't

1607
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,640
people use it I I agree but it does

1608
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,340
happen so the problem is valid but the

1609
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,020
solutions are there that are existing we

1610
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,640
have mechanics and protocols and on

1611
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,140
implementations I don't think we need

1612
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,300
this stuff thank you

1613
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:46,020
thank you Peter I I think was also AC's

1614
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:49,140
point with the admin tags

1615
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,080
uh okay

1616
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:56,000
is that it an acute

1617
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:02,480
okay thank you

1618
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,020
[Music]

1619
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:14,940
thank you

1620
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:17,059
thank you

1621
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:20,389
[Music]

1622
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,420
oh okay thank you

1623
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:33,679
oh you're very quiet

1624
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,480
Leanne

1625
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:42,120
okay okay I can see it ah much better

1626
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,800
now

1627
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,120
okay thank you uh hi this is Leanne uh

1628
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,640
from Channel mobile I'm going through

1629
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,880
talking about the topic of advertising

1630
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,980
unreachable links in our spive

1631
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:01,339
next please

1632
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,280
and this is the zero zero version of the

1633
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,460
draft but the requirement has been

1634
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,460
discussed in the interim meeting in

1635
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,060
September and

1636
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:17,400
as discussed in the interim meeting

1637
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,060
there are some requirements to Edward

1638
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:24,179
Heights and reachable links in the base

1639
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:29,940
algorithm of igp uh to avoid the

1640
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:33,480
building the normal shortest path tree

1641
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:38,940
and for ospi for the current executing

1642
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:42,860
mechanisms cannot meet this requirement

1643
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:48,140
So based on this we propose a new draft

1644
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,420
to elaborate this problem and the

1645
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:53,400
solution

1646
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,140
next please

1647
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:58,140
sorry

1648
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:09,900
okay and this is the initial scenario of

1649
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,480
the problem

1650
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,940
since it's not only related with the

1651
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,120
flex algo but

1652
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,540
here is just a typical example when the

1653
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:24,300
flux Echo is applied to the network

1654
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,400
slice solution

1655
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,900
uh

1656
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:31,760
from this topology based on the default

1657
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,000
algorithm the right links which is the

1658
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,239
sub interface with dedicated bandwidth

1659
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:40,460
resources

1660
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:44,420
it is used by the flex

1661
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:49,080
algo128 and it's newly deployed for

1662
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,060
Network slides

1663
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:55,860
it is expected that only the particular

1664
01:19:55,860 --> 01:20:00,000
flows which it belongs to the slides are

1665
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,659
transmitted on right links

1666
01:20:02,659 --> 01:20:05,640
however from the picture can see all

1667
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,520
links are concerned in the default

1668
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,540
topology used by normal SPF calculation

1669
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:16,219
and the flows of best effort service

1670
01:20:16,219 --> 01:20:21,140
will be still into the red links

1671
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:26,580
uh so our goal of this draft is to

1672
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,300
exclude the newly deployed links from

1673
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,060
the base algorithm

1674
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:36,440
to about data changing the ignating

1675
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:40,159
existing traffic forwarding

1676
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:43,699
next please

1677
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:49,140
and this is the current situation of the

1678
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:52,760
maximum link metric in ospf for

1679
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,860
the hours they one two four seven

1680
01:20:55,860 --> 01:21:01,500
defines that it is unreachable but when

1681
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,620
the I would say one five eight three

1682
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:05,900
updates

1683
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,580
that is reachable

1684
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:12,960
and from the current implementation of

1685
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,600
most devices

1686
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:18,600
and they are based on the version of the

1687
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,540
RFC

1688
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:25,440
2328 and a link with the maximum link

1689
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,340
metric is treated as the literature book

1690
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:32,780
uh so to reduce this problem

1691
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:37,500
extensions or updates for SPF is

1692
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,360
required

1693
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,440
next please

1694
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,460
um this structure proposed the two

1695
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,920
solutions for the problem this is the

1696
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,420
first solution solution a uh it leverage

1697
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,480
the existing mechanism as much as

1698
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,500
possible treat the maximum link metric

1699
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,440
as unreachable

1700
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,600
using this solution the backwards

1701
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,940
compatibility

1702
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:12,480
should be guaranteed or else there will

1703
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:17,219
be routine Loops for example the metric

1704
01:22:17,219 --> 01:22:20,940
for each link is is shown as the falling

1705
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:27,080
figures and the router a trade the link

1706
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,120
d2i4 as reachable but the router B

1707
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:34,080
treated as unreachable so there will be

1708
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:38,600
routine Loop between a and b

1709
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,800
uh next please

1710
01:22:44,179 --> 01:22:47,280
to avoid the loop all the routers

1711
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,739
Through The Negotiator function

1712
01:22:49,739 --> 01:22:54,900
functional capabilities so a new picture

1713
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,940
is proposed based on the current

1714
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:58,400
mechanism

1715
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,390
which is

1716
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:01,820
[Music]

1717
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:06,800
describe the in the RFC 7770

1718
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:12,120
so the new beta we just call it m to

1719
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,460
Ambit

1720
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:18,500
and it is newly added to indicator that

1721
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:22,140
the routers support the new filter and

1722
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:25,320
the maximum link metric should be

1723
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:28,199
treated as unreachable during normal

1724
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:31,440
sphere of computations

1725
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:35,460
uh if there is any router that's not as

1726
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:39,920
voltage so all the routers

1727
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,380
should recalculator

1728
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:44,780
the SPF

1729
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:48,540
to trade the maximum link metric as

1730
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,760
reachable

1731
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,880
um

1732
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:56,640
this describes the maximum link metric

1733
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:01,020
can be extended to the following tra or

1734
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:06,360
lsas the router LC and ospre2 extended

1735
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:10,320
link Tri and the router link Trio or

1736
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,460
splvis 3 utility

1737
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:16,800
um

1738
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,239
next please

1739
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:26,360
this was the second solution solution b

1740
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:29,340
instead of changing the meaning of the

1741
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:32,100
maximum link metric a new unreachable

1742
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,699
link flag is proposed

1743
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:36,860
it is

1744
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:40,380
advert Heights the in Osprey with two

1745
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:43,140
extended linkedia way of extended link

1746
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:45,260
opaque I see

1747
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:50,940
which is defined in rc7

1748
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:57,360
6 8 4 and also the ospr V3 router link

1749
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,780
tell me of Euro trials which is defined

1750
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:04,019
in rc8362

1751
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:11,580
also the new average bowling flag

1752
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:15,780
if it is used the backward compatibility

1753
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:20,580
should be considered and it is similar

1754
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:24,500
with the previous solution

1755
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:28,679
okay next please

1756
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:32,760
oh that's all we would like to hear your

1757
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:37,040
questions or comments thank you

1758
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:40,080
okay thanks AC you're in the cube yes

1759
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,659
speaking as working group member

1760
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:45,239
have you uh

1761
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:48,199
you gotta turn the mic

1762
01:25:48,199 --> 01:25:52,679
yeah speaking as working group member uh

1763
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:54,960
I thought about this and I guess either

1764
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,420
solution would work as long as we have

1765
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:00,500
the capability and don't use it

1766
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:04,320
the it would be nice if we use the

1767
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,120
capability just to use the same thing

1768
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:09,540
that isis uses with the max Network

1769
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:12,000
I know if you didn't have the capability

1770
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,920
you can't just start using it because

1771
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,159
many implementations use the reference

1772
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:19,860
bandwidth to compute the network network

1773
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:23,100
so if there's an outlier link that's

1774
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,040
very slow it's going to have Max metric

1775
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,139
and all of a sudden these would

1776
01:26:28,139 --> 01:26:30,239
if we change this without the capability

1777
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:32,280
all of a sudden these links would start

1778
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:35,219
actually that's a reason not to use it

1779
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:39,120
even if they support it because these

1780
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,820
links are these links are going to be

1781
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:44,460
Auto configured to Max metric

1782
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:46,440
just the way

1783
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,420
uh again it was it was done for

1784
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:51,500
convenience but

1785
01:26:51,659 --> 01:26:54,540
anyway I think I think if we were to use

1786
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:56,219
max metric

1787
01:26:56,219 --> 01:26:58,620
we need to put a note in there that you

1788
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:01,739
should not ever use max metric when

1789
01:27:01,739 --> 01:27:03,600
using reference bandwidth that's all I

1790
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,139
was going to say

1791
01:27:07,739 --> 01:27:09,540
I'll put I'll put it to the list too I

1792
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:10,920
can see some

1793
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,620
people not understanding

1794
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,620
there there wasn't enough context in my

1795
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,960
con in my comment unless you're really

1796
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,080
familiar with ospf configuration

1797
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:26,300
okay thanks AC John you're up

1798
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:30,719
as a working group participant um yeah I

1799
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,420
mean I I got that it's like if if you

1800
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,280
use max metric for this signaling then

1801
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,020
you if you actually want to Signal a

1802
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,699
metric it has to be topped out at Max

1803
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:42,120
metric minus one which I think basically

1804
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,159
it's like the the two solutions either

1805
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,719
one would work it's sort of unfortunate

1806
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:47,699
we have to go there

1807
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:49,920
um but you know given that there's one

1808
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,199
solution that requires you to treat Max

1809
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:55,080
metric in this new and special way and

1810
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,639
the other solution just creates a

1811
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,440
distinguished don't use this link and it

1812
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,960
doesn't try to reuse an existing field

1813
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,659
you might as well go with the one that

1814
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:05,900
has fewer knock-on effects so meaning

1815
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,300
solution number two seems like less of a

1816
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,380
pain to me

1817
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:15,080
thank you thanks John Katan

1818
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:20,639
so I I had a comment about the

1819
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:23,280
capability part I would suggest the

1820
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:27,300
authors to look at RFC uh the ospf host

1821
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,840
bit RFC uh it's 8770

1822
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:33,600
on how to handle this kind of things

1823
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,900
which affect the SPF

1824
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:40,080
um and I I think the draft needs uh uh

1825
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,900
work in that direction

1826
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,719
RFC 8770

1827
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:46,800
thanks

1828
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,120
thanks

1829
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:53,599
Shada okay thank you I will see it

1830
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,820
hello can you hear me

1831
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,199
yes

1832
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,179
I was just thinking there could be

1833
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:02,639
alternate ways that can be done locally

1834
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,739
right I mean because you don't want to

1835
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:07,620
use it in the default topology

1836
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:10,860
you advertise maximum trick for the in

1837
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:12,659
the default topology so the traffic

1838
01:29:12,659 --> 01:29:15,300
would always use alternate paths which

1839
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,460
are lower metric and if there are no

1840
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,380
alternate paths traffic would still get

1841
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,239
steered to this node through this link

1842
01:29:21,239 --> 01:29:23,820
and which I mean you can have local

1843
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:26,219
rules on that router to drop the traffic

1844
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:28,139
because if there are no other paths you

1845
01:29:28,139 --> 01:29:29,940
simply want to drop right you strictly

1846
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,500
don't want to allow other traffic on

1847
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,000
this link

1848
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,699
I I don't know why you didn't think that

1849
01:29:35,699 --> 01:29:38,419
as a solution

1850
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:45,840
uh because uh the I know your question

1851
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,800
and I try to explain it because from our

1852
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:54,239
scenario the the the new link the link

1853
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:59,340
of the sub interface is newly ID added

1854
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:04,500
so uh if the cost is much more smaller

1855
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:08,280
than the default topology the traffic

1856
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:12,060
will be zero to this step interface

1857
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,100
better

1858
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:17,960
this is not what we want

1859
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,159
yeah I I get you get your case I mean

1860
01:30:23,159 --> 01:30:25,860
the the flex I'll go can can use a

1861
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,020
different metric type right which

1862
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:29,400
uh

1863
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,560
which will have a lower metric for this

1864
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,960
these links and then traffic will get

1865
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,639
the flex I'll go traffic would get

1866
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:38,100
steered on these links whereas the

1867
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,040
default you can

1868
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,780
default will use igp metric right you

1869
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:47,460
keep igp metric High metric on these uh

1870
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,880
uh yes there are there are three

1871
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:53,360
calculated tabs for Flex I'll go and no

1872
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:57,590
but if we use other other

1873
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:58,980
[Music]

1874
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:02,880
metric tabs all the links

1875
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,960
oh should be management

1876
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,420
for this

1877
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:12,780
so yeah because it's much more easier

1878
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:16,040
for the implementation I think

1879
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:19,080
yeah I mean you you I mean it's equally

1880
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,120
difficult all your vendors to implement

1881
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,520
this and update upgrade this upgrade all

1882
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,800
the routers and only then you can use

1883
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,420
this feature right it seems much more

1884
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:28,800
easier you can just use a different

1885
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,520
metric type

1886
01:31:32,699 --> 01:31:35,880
well that that's just my thought I do

1887
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,100
see what where you're coming from thank

1888
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,219
you

1889
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:43,620
okay thank you we can discuss it because

1890
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:48,739
we have solved this problem uh before

1891
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:53,840
all right thanks Leanne

1892
01:31:54,659 --> 01:31:57,138
thank you

1893
01:31:58,199 --> 01:31:59,820
all right I think we're on our last

1894
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:02,520
presentation

1895
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:05,520
goes back right yes

1896
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,540
a little speck

1897
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:25,679
okay hello everyone I'm from Chengdu

1898
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:28,920
hello good morning and today I will give

1899
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:32,219
a Italian about the ospf and the disease

1900
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:36,139
retention for the floor Style

1901
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:40,860
okay while we extension rgp for the flow

1902
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:43,260
Sparkle flow server is as you know is

1903
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:46,260
used for the traffic filter and details

1904
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:49,860
and digitals like this to protect the

1905
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:55,139
network normally EGP is used to just

1906
01:32:55,139 --> 01:32:57,260
manage the flows background

1907
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:00,600
and this should protocol rules between

1908
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:06,199
the PE and and but for some in some

1909
01:33:06,199 --> 01:33:10,560
scanner the attacker is to the attack to

1910
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,800
the attack to other C so if we close to

1911
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,380
the source patch the production and

1912
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:20,040
block the traffic as early as possible

1913
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,540
it's better

1914
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:24,139
okay next

1915
01:33:24,139 --> 01:33:27,540
and another scenario is in some Network

1916
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:31,679
there's no PDP deployment so uh just

1917
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:35,480
actually is used like the campus Network

1918
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:39,840
so but in this network so uh the

1919
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:43,679
attacker is also exist so RTP it needs

1920
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,500
to distribute the first packages to the

1921
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,780
other routers and to protect the network

1922
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:51,420
okay next

1923
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:53,580
hmm

1924
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:57,600
and also in this scenario the traffic

1925
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,040
analysis is

1926
01:34:03,139 --> 01:34:06,719
the attacker is in time to say yes so

1927
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:10,560
people use EP we need to just can

1928
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,639
distribute the uh

1929
01:34:13,639 --> 01:34:17,880
flows background to the P2 but the C2

1930
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,699
Hunter uh got the information so if we

1931
01:34:20,699 --> 01:34:24,000
use the IDP the rules can distribute to

1932
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,780
the C2 and we can we can

1933
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:32,100
and block the attacker at the C2 okay so

1934
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,500
that's why we you mentioned the igp of

1935
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,920
the Earth

1936
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,480
so uh when you spending the ospf for an

1937
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:46,199
easys for the first pack for this we

1938
01:34:46,199 --> 01:34:49,380
Define a new job that's the First Bank

1939
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:50,540
distribution

1940
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:54,540
and this skill will have the format of

1941
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:57,300
the of the mental way of the disease and

1942
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:02,639
we add a flag IO is to to identify as a

1943
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,679
control lithium between the levels of

1944
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:07,980
this Cuba and this theory has have two

1945
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:10,199
subject of it and some something always

1946
01:35:10,199 --> 01:35:13,638
in the flat

1947
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:23,699
is the same as defined in I have say

1948
01:35:23,699 --> 01:35:26,280
5507 as well

1949
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:29,300
okay next

1950
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,800
two and B3 is different for all three

1951
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,699
two we use the the top chain or type of

1952
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:41,880
11 I would say for optical C for this

1953
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,880
for Carrier this

1954
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:47,940
QB and this table also have two

1955
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:49,260
subtitles

1956
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:52,380
one is the prospective filter and why is

1957
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:55,620
the flow spot action uh also the same as

1958
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:58,739
defined in five five percent seven five

1959
01:35:58,739 --> 01:36:02,699
and also as a result information I would

1960
01:36:02,699 --> 01:36:06,800
say we add the flow spark habit

1961
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,880
through other advances

1962
01:36:11,719 --> 01:36:14,100
of the router

1963
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:16,500
okay all right next

1964
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:20,100
so also V3 we maybe we will Define a new

1965
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:24,179
outside to carry the prospect of it and

1966
01:36:24,179 --> 01:36:27,179
this Theory also have two sub theory of

1967
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:29,880
our filter spark filter and Prospect

1968
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,540
action and the same as

1969
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:38,120
fc575 and also the flash for Community

1970
01:36:38,179 --> 01:36:42,540
we used and for us therefore maybe we

1971
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:47,400
can transport this information uh or use

1972
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:51,960
the also GT like this okay that's oh I

1973
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,239
have registered

1974
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:56,760
all right

1975
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,699
okay hi uh so

1976
01:36:59,699 --> 01:37:02,219
this is this is coming back that was

1977
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:05,820
previously presented I think uh in Isis

1978
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,320
and ospf separately yes yes this is the

1979
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:12,739
ospf for work

1980
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:18,179
so uh this will be me speaking as

1981
01:37:18,179 --> 01:37:20,600
working group member um

1982
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:23,340
this is you're configuring your

1983
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:26,219
firewalls with your igp I I mean this is

1984
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:27,780
just not something that we should be

1985
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:30,719
using our routing protocol for

1986
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:33,000
um you know you have a traffic analyzer

1987
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,400
it should be using your network

1988
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,739
management tools to configure your

1989
01:37:37,739 --> 01:37:41,100
routers right I mean the I understand

1990
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:43,980
that bgp is a dump truck and everything

1991
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,900
goes in it and I also understand there

1992
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,460
might actually be a reason for it

1993
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:48,900
because you know you might want to be

1994
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:51,300
giving this information to another

1995
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,340
administrative domain

1996
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,739
but that's not the case here this we're

1997
01:37:55,739 --> 01:37:57,239
talking igps it's the same

1998
01:37:57,239 --> 01:38:00,000
administrative domain

1999
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,960
um

2000
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,179
yeah so there's there's no point of that

2001
01:38:03,179 --> 01:38:06,360
you did bring up this ce1 to ce2 case

2002
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:10,260
but that's insane right I mean no no

2003
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,780
provider is no cost you don't have

2004
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:14,600
Microsoft

2005
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,400
configuring Google's routers right

2006
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,679
that's just not gonna happen

2007
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:23,000
yeah well

2008
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:27,000
let me let me rephrase it then let's say

2009
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,159
how do you speak let's say are you

2010
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:32,299
speaking as an individual

2011
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:35,840
yeah

2012
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:38,159
I yeah I should have just picked two

2013
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:41,760
better competitors but yeah like

2014
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,639
uh anyway that that's my comment as a as

2015
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:46,260
a working group member

2016
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,659
um I'll let some other folks talk now

2017
01:38:48,659 --> 01:38:49,739
less

2018
01:38:49,739 --> 01:38:54,440
okay but you can come across the West

2019
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:01,800
yeah so uh I agree with Chris I think

2020
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,679
this does not belong in the igps

2021
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:07,739
I think from a presentation point of

2022
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:10,679
view it's it was very nice that we that

2023
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:12,199
we

2024
01:39:12,199 --> 01:39:15,060
started with the ospf generalized

2025
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:18,000
transport and ended with this flow spec

2026
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,440
because

2027
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,380
if you were going to put this in the igp

2028
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,199
at all

2029
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:27,659
the the generalized transport or in the

2030
01:39:27,659 --> 01:39:30,420
case of Isis gen app would be the only

2031
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:32,940
way to do it I'm not real enthusiastic

2032
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:35,699
about that either but this certainly

2033
01:39:35,699 --> 01:39:38,340
doesn't belong in the rubbing instance

2034
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:42,139
of the igps thanks

2035
01:39:43,139 --> 01:39:46,199
thanks class uh Jeff

2036
01:39:46,199 --> 01:39:48,420
has so

2037
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:51,060
I agree with the other discussion points

2038
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,620
about this probably belongs and

2039
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,000
something like the generalized transport

2040
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,820
uh just to get it out of the igp I've

2041
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:58,860
looked at the encodings I spend a very

2042
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:00,480
large amount of time working through

2043
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,659
flow spec both in IDR and in Juniper's

2044
01:40:03,659 --> 01:40:06,199
implementation your encodings are clean

2045
01:40:06,199 --> 01:40:08,340
this would work

2046
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:11,520
uh the one point I ask you to consider

2047
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:12,840
you know have further discussion

2048
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,940
specifically in the igp context aside

2049
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:17,400
from the use cases is are you

2050
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,860
comfortable with very large flow spec

2051
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:22,860
filters going into an LSA

2052
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:25,500
because you know bgp can fit 4K inside

2053
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:29,280
of a pdu we have seen field experience

2054
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,219
with you know filters that are in the

2055
01:40:32,219 --> 01:40:34,260
order of two to three k worth of size

2056
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:37,440
just for the match statistics

2057
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,900
my impression is that uh you really

2058
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,699
don't want to put two to three k worth

2059
01:40:41,699 --> 01:40:44,520
of State into an LSA yeah

2060
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:47,460
it gets a little cranky

2061
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:49,820
okay

2062
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:54,060
okay thanks Jeff AC

2063
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,360
okay

2064
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,860
Linda speaking as a working group member

2065
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:02,699
the one thing I'm wondering let's say we

2066
01:41:02,699 --> 01:41:05,100
were to do this in gen app and

2067
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,020
generalized transport and we were to do

2068
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:10,020
this could we just get away with not

2069
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,360
having to redefine

2070
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:17,100
the the flow spec and to just use the

2071
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:20,340
vgp definitions rather than

2072
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:24,860
you you cannot okay

2073
01:41:26,699 --> 01:41:28,199
I'm

2074
01:41:28,199 --> 01:41:30,919
yeah okay

2075
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:38,219
Jeff has again so

2076
01:41:38,219 --> 01:41:40,619
the the document you have is very close

2077
01:41:40,619 --> 01:41:44,219
to the bgp flow spec that's great you're

2078
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:46,139
actually taking some of the lessons I

2079
01:41:46,139 --> 01:41:47,580
have to look at the codings make sure

2080
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:50,340
that psept did when they decided to do

2081
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,320
something very similar and use flow spec

2082
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:55,679
encoding rules to carry flow specs into

2083
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,119
psap

2084
01:41:57,119 --> 01:42:00,380
there are bugs in the existing RFC for

2085
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:03,860
uh refer for flow spec for extensibility

2086
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:06,360
I think you may have avoided it by using

2087
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:07,920
something close to psip I have to double

2088
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:09,000
check

2089
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,580
I urge you to pay attention to the flow

2090
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:13,980
spec V2 work that's going to be

2091
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:16,020
happening in IDR we're picking up heavy

2092
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:17,400
steam right now

2093
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,960
because that's going to change a number

2094
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,320
of things about how flow spec works uh

2095
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,000
so you're

2096
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,460
you're chasing the try to get up to what

2097
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:28,080
flow spec currently can do rather than

2098
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:30,239
potentially where it should be going but

2099
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,699
in terms of encoding your flexibility is

2100
01:42:32,699 --> 01:42:34,860
about where it needs to be the changes

2101
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:38,340
to get to safety that psap has if you

2102
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:41,699
haven't done them already is very small

2103
01:42:41,699 --> 01:42:43,699
um

2104
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:50,520
uh John you're you're up

2105
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,400
just very briefly thank you Jeff for

2106
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,100
also mentioning the pcap option if you

2107
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:59,719
don't want to put this into the igp

2108
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:04,320
great

2109
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:08,000
okay well we didn't run over

2110
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,260
okay thank you

2111
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:12,380
um

2112
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:15,840
yeah let's talk about uh I'll just

2113
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:16,739
mention

2114
01:43:16,739 --> 01:43:18,719
um we do we did have an item that we

2115
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:20,100
were thinking about putting on here

2116
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:22,500
which was the uh multi-part

2117
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,780
tlv uh

2118
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:27,600
discussions that have been going on

2119
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,300
um and and Tony and and Les both have a

2120
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:31,800
you know I think they might have worked

2121
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,480
on some slides but I think we're going

2122
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:36,179
to do an interim on that we're gonna uh

2123
01:43:36,179 --> 01:43:39,540
also I'd like to get more solutions

2124
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,580
based I I mean just personally as a

2125
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:43,920
working group member I I've got an idea

2126
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,780
of what we should do and I you know me

2127
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:47,820
and AC were just talking on the side and

2128
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:50,639
I'd like to get that out on the list

2129
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:53,340
and then you know and then have a

2130
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:55,260
meeting to sort of find finalize the

2131
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:58,020
decision on what we should do there

2132
01:43:58,020 --> 01:43:59,340
um

2133
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:00,960
I don't I don't want to be unfair and

2134
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,000
present my position since we didn't give

2135
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,800
the other people

2136
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,719
uh speaking is work speaking this

2137
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,699
working group member yeah I'm really uh

2138
01:44:08,699 --> 01:44:10,980
I'm really hesitant since I you know

2139
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:13,560
much more uh have much more experience

2140
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:17,760
with ospf than Isis to inject uh what

2141
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,460
how I think it should work in the

2142
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:23,600
meantime we have found there's

2143
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,820
lots more deployed implementations than

2144
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:29,639
we originally I may not I've talked to

2145
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:32,280
other other people and they they yeah

2146
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:33,719
I've heard I've heard as well there's at

2147
01:44:33,719 --> 01:44:35,159
least two different vendors that have

2148
01:44:35,159 --> 01:44:38,520
done this have you heard more than that

2149
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:41,940
I have yes okay all right so it would

2150
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,800
have been nice like I was really hoping

2151
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,540
that those vendors would have spoken up

2152
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:49,199
on the list if you still could like I

2153
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,360
